      <p>I've been a member of the Chrome developer relations team for the last 9
months, where one aspect of my job is developer support. I actively
monitor the chromium-extensions@chromium.org list, answering questions
about developing Chrome extensions. Thankfully, there are many others that
help me in this endeavor, both from the Chrome team and from within the
developer community itself, notably a certain <a href="http://goo.gl/di3kR">PhistucK</a>, the current
record holder for the number of messages posted to the list.</p>

<p>Over the last years, another channel of questions has emerged:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow (SO)</a>. SO is a great Q&amp;A community for
software developers, providing many advantages over ordinary discussion
groups. Google has recognized this and sponsored SO tags,
such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome">google-chrome</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-extension">google-chrome-extension</a>. As I
outlined in an mail to the group, we are now including SO as
an official Chrome extension developer support channel.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>As part of optimizing the support workflow, I wrote a Chrome extension
which monitors questions with certain tags on SO and other Stack
Exchange sites. This extension implements a browser action which gets
badged with the number of unreviewed questions.</p>

<p>The extension UI uses the same visual style as other Google apps, and
blends well into Chrome. I think it works reasonably well from a design
perspective, both in the options page and in a browser action:</p>

<p><img src="/stack-exchange-question-notifier/stack-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>If you're curious to see how the extension is implemented, the source
<a href="https://github.com/borismus/Question-Monitor-for-Stack-Exchange">is available</a> free of charge! This extension was implemented in
<a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Closure-style</a> JavaScript.</p>

<p>If you support developers on Stack Overflow, please <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bnnkhapbhkejookmhgpgaikfdoegkmdp">install it</a>,
give me constructive feedback and consider monitoring the
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-extension">google-chrome-extension</a> tag :)</p>
