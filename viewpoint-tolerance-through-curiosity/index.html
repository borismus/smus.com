      <p>Polarization isn't necessarily problematic. Strictly defined, it refers to the
divergence of political extremes. In fact, a wider variety of opinions may
actually be a <a href="https://ratedzed.wordpress.com/2017/05/20/the-biased-media/">good situation</a>. Things start to go south when a tribal
us-verus-them mentality takes over, giving rise to an uncharitable view of the
other side. This thinking is especially common among the <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-shouting-class.html">shouting
classes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those that disagree with me must be stupid, evil, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only is this incorrect, but adhering to this position is actively bad for
society. It prevents finding common ground and encourages wild policy swings as
power is transfered from one uncompromising faction to the next. The same facts
can generate different viewpoints, each deserving of a spot in the marketplace
of ideas, even if we personally disagree with them.</p>

<p>With <a href="/debaters-friendly-disagreement/">Debaters</a>, Antonio and I tried to bring people that disagree
together. Sadly most people don't want to converse with the other side whom
they perceive to be their mortal enemies. The problem must be approached more
obliquely, taking into account human nature. This post is about using <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">quizzes
like this one</a> to lure people into learning more about the other side
by appealing to a powerful emotion: curiosity.</p>

<h1>Metaquiz format</h1>

<p>I'm calling it a metaquiz, since it asks both about the test taker's own
knowledge and derived viewpoints, as well as their guesses about how well the
other side did on the same quiz. Interestingly, the only fuzzy thing here are
your own beliefs. Knowledge about other people's beliefs is factually
verifiable.</p>

<pre>
1. What do you believe about the issue?
2. What do you know about the issue?
3. What do you know about the other side?
     Evil: what does the other side believe about the issue?
     Stupid: what does the other side know about the issue?
</pre>

<h1>Why would anyone do this?</h1>

<p>In one word: curiosity.</p>

<p>According to the research in <a href="/books/psychology-of-curiosity/">this survey paper</a>, being a curious
person ("trait curiosity") doesn't correlate strongly to other traits like IQ,
age, and sex. Instead, it is situational context that can pique curiousity
("state curiosity"). This is good news for me, since anyone can become curious
about anything.</p>

<p>On the flip side, curiosity about something requires that you be interested in
the pertinent topic, and usually increases with knowledge.  Loewenstein explains
curiosity in terms of an information gap. The more you know about a subject, the
more you know what you don't know. The novice is proud of what he knows even if
it is small in the absolute sense, relating closely to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunningâ€“Kruger
effect</a>. Gaining expertise, the novice learns more about the scope of
the domain, and shifts to thinking in terms of what they don't know yet. This
reveals a gap that they strive to fill. This news is not so good, but
Loewenstein suggests curiosity inducing stimuli, which I hope to take into
account in designing the quiz:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directly questioning is itself curiosity inducing, especially with a guess and
feedback cycle found in quizzes. A study showed that the more immediate the
feedback, the higher the curiosity.</li>
<li>The nature of a good quiz is that you will sometimes be wrong. If you are
wrong about a fact related to the topic, you may learn about an information
gap which will increase curiosity about the topic. If your expectation about
the other group is violated (ie. violation of expectations), curiosity about
that group increases.</li>
<li>If you see yourself as knowledgeable about a topic, you may be curious about
how much you really know about it. This can be viewed in terms of
what Loewenstein describes as the "competence motive", the desire to master
your own environment. </li>
<li>Loewenstein brings up the example of someone laughing aloud as they read a
newspaper article. This posession of information by someone else is also
curiosity inducing. What does the other side know?</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect">Zeigarnik effect</a> states that people remember uncompleted or
interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. The last part of the quiz (what
does the other side think) requires a critical mass of responders, which means
that results will take some time to produce. This may serve to increase
curiosity.</li>
</ul>

<h1>A metaquiz about climate change</h1>

<p>To test this format, I decided to pick a specific topic to reduce the scope of
questions. Climate change is a good topic for several reasons. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pro: the topic is increasingly polarizing along party lines, most recently
after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.</li>
<li>Pro: it is well grounded in science, which means there are plenty of hard
facts that can be verified and serve as a baseline of truth.</li>
<li>Con: climate change consistently shows up last in terms of topics that the US
public cares about.</li>
</ul>

<p>I put together a quiz following the template above, which first surveys your
climate change-related beliefs, then quizzes you on climate knowledge, and
finally asks you to guess what the other side believes and how they did on the
quiz. </p>

<p>If participants do poorly on the "other side" section, they may begin to wonder:
"maybe they're not all stupid?". Then, if it turns out that they have
incorrectly stereotyped beliefs of the other side, they might wonder "maybe
they're not all evil?". If participants do poorly on the quiz itself, they may
learn something about climate change, which isn't such a bad thing either.</p>

<p>So if you have a few minutes, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">please try the climate metaquiz</a> and send it to
everyone you know, especially friends (or enemies!) on the opposite side.
