      <p>It's been over three years since the design of this site has been
updated. Time to change that!</p>

<p><img src="0days.jpg" class="floatright"/></p>

<p>This is the fifth revision of this site's design. Looking over <a href="/redesign-2012">previous
designs</a>, I've been happier with minimal designs,
especially <a href="/redesign-2012/v2.png">this one</a> from 2012. I was inspired
by many excellent designs such as <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">Butterick's Practical
Typography</a>,
<a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">Teehan+Lax</a>, <a href="http://www.erikjohanssonphoto.com/">Erik
Johansson</a>,
<a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/death-to-typewriters-9b7712847639">Medium</a>
and <a href="http://frankchimero.com/writing/other-halves">Frank Chimero</a>.</p>

<p>The new design is visually cleaner. I <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">use
flexbox</a> in many places, which makes
the CSS far more intuitive. The responsive parts are very simple,
consisting of just ten CSS declarations.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Rather than subjecting readers to my face on every page, I have a simple
stipple background on the <a href="/about">about page</a>, which I created using the
complex but functional <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/stipplegen2/">StippleGen</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I've started working on a self-hosted visual link blog that you
can check out in under <a href="/inspiration">inspiring clippings</a>. I've
implemented a companion Chrome extension that makes it super easy to
clip inspiring content from anywhere on the web and bring it to that
page.</p>

<p><strong>Typography:</strong> I'm continuing to use Google fonts, which seems to be so
much simpler to use than various competitors. I have not completely
optimized my selection of fonts, but this is satisfactory given my
belief that no design is ever finished. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/improving-ux-through-front-end-performance">Performance is UX</a> too,
and aesthetic decisions need to be counterbalanced by mundane
considerations like page load time.  Unfortunately <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Dosis">Dosis</a> didn't
make the cut.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> This site is still built using the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">lightning static
blog</a> engine, which I'm continuing to improve. On that front,
I've dropped the ambitious goal of being able to edit content from any
device using dropbox, since in practice I always author on my laptop.
Instead, the focus has been on optimizing the edit flow for the local
offline case, and I have built <a href="https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload">livereload</a> into the local preview
server. As far as hosting, I have conceded to GitHub Pages, and have
migrated away from using S3 directly.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks:</strong> to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemartin604">Mike</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/paul_irish">Paul</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/smattyang">Seungho</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/scottjenson">Scott</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/mahemoff">Michael</a>, and other awesome friends that
gave me excellent design suggestions and found bugs!</p>

<p>While I appreciate companies like <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> and
<a href="http://svbtle.com/">Svbtle</a> advancing the aesthetics of the web, I
completely <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html">agree with Matthew Butterick</a>'s view, and will
continue self-hosting my writings for as long as possible. Long live the
plurality of the web!</p>
