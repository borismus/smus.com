  <a href='/design-v5'><h1 class='title'>Site redesign, version five</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>It's been over three years since the design of this site has been
updated. Time to change that!</p>

<p><img src="/design-v5/0days.jpg" class="floatright"/></p>

<p>This is the fifth revision of this site's design. Looking over <a href="/redesign-2012">previous
designs</a>, I've been happier with minimal designs,
especially <a href="/redesign-2012/v2.png">this one</a> from 2012. I was inspired
by many excellent designs such as <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">Butterick's Practical
Typography</a>,
<a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">Teehan+Lax</a>, <a href="http://www.erikjohanssonphoto.com/">Erik
Johansson</a>,
<a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/death-to-typewriters-9b7712847639">Medium</a>
and <a href="http://frankchimero.com/writing/other-halves">Frank Chimero</a>.</p>

<p>The new design is visually cleaner. I <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">use
flexbox</a> in many places, which makes
the CSS far more intuitive. The responsive parts are very simple,
consisting of just ten CSS declarations.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>Last summer I visited Austria, the capital of classical music. I had the
pleasure of hearing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespro_della_Beata_Vergine">Vespers of 1610</a> in the great
<a href="http://goo.gl/e3WBB2">Salzburger Dom (photosphere)</a>. The most memorable part of
the piece was that the soloists moved between movements, so their voices
and instruments emanated from surprising parts of the great hall.
Inspired, I returned to the west coast and eventually came around to
building a spatial audio prototypes like this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://borismus.github.io/moving-music"><img src="/spatial-audio-web-vr/collage_small.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a demo" /></a></p>

<p>Spatial audio is an important part of any good VR experience, since the
more senses we simulate, the more compelling it feels to our sense
fusing mind. WebVR, WebGL, and WebAudio all act as complementary specs
to enable this necessary experience. As you would expect, because it
uses the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate</a>, this demo can be viewed on
mobile, desktop, in Cardboard or an Oculus Rift. In all cases, you will
need headphones :)</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>VR on the web threatens to cleave the web platform in twain, like mobile
did before it. The solution then and the solution now is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web
Design</a>, which websites to scale well for all form factors.
Similarly, for VR to succeed on the web, we need to figure out how to
make VR experiences that work both in any VR headset, and also without a
VR headset at all.</p>

<p><img src="/responsive-vr/hmds.png" alt="Various head mounted displays." /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate</a> is a new starting point for building
responsive web VR experiences that work on popular VR headsets and
degrace gracefully on other platforms. Check out a couple of demos, <a href="http://borismus.github.io/webvr-boilerplate/">a
simple one</a> and one <a href="http://borismus.github.io/sechelt">ported from MozVR</a>.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>Sensors found in smartphones define the mobile experience. GPS and the
magnetometer enable the fluid experience of maps; motion sensing enables
activity recognition and games, and of course the camera and microphone
allow whole categories of rich media applications. Beyond these now
obvious examples, sensors can also enable clever inventions, such as
<a href="http://www.cycloramic.com/">Cycloramic</a>, which used the vibrator motor in iPhones (4 and 5) to
rotate the phone and take a panorama, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.pushup.pro">pushup counters</a> which
use the proximity sensor to count repetitions, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carrotpop.www.smth">Send Me To
Heaven</a>, which uses the accelerometer to determine flight time of
a phone thrown vertically as high as possible. I've had some experience
using and abusing sensors too, most recently for the <a href="http://smus.com/talk/2014/io14/">Cardboard magnet
button</a>.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5775qwORk4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>However, over the last couple of years, I've had to step away from the
web as a development platform, in part because of the poor state of
sensor APIs.  In this post, I will describe some of the problems, take a
look at sensor APIs on iOS and Android, and suggest a solution in the
spirit of the <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">extensible web manifesto</a>.</p>

    <p>This year's <a href="http://www.acm.org/uist/uist2014/">UIST</a> was held in Waikiki, Honolulu, the undisputed
tourist capital of Hawaii. I've stuck to my now three year old habit of
taking notes and <a href="http://smus.com/uist-2013">posting my favorite work</a>. Since last year,
the conference has grown an extra track. The split was generally OK for
me, with my track mostly dedicated to user interface innovation
(sensors, etc) and another more concerned with crowdsourcing,
visualization, and more traditional UIs.</p>

<p>My overall feeling was that the research was mostly interesting from a
tech perspective, but focused on solving the wrong problem. For example,
at least 5 papers/posters/demos were focused on typing on smartwatches.
The keynotes were very thought provoking, especially when juxtaposed
with one another.</p>

  <a href='/addressable-apps'><h1 class='title'>Addressable apps</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>It is human nature to create taxonomies for everything: people, places,
and things.  Without such a system of reference, we become lost and
disoriented.  Imagine your city with street names and addresses blanked
out. Finding your favorite cafe, meeting up with your friend on the
weekend, even locating your own parked car would become incredibly
difficult. Travel outside your city would become far more
challenging.</p>

<p>The web's defining property is addressability. URLs on the web are like
street names and addresses in the physical world. This makes sharing
and cross-linking easy. Non-web platforms are a little bit like our
city with blanked out street names and addresses. There's no good
way of talking about where you currently are, or how to get somewhere
else. These platforms typically give users a crutch to help with the
issue, such as a share button or dialog. But these create an
inherently inferior experience, since addressability is no longer
built-in. Addressability becomes a burden on the app developer, and
as a result, the platform is no longer navigable.</p>

<p>In light of the success of Android and iOS, and given a potential
explosion in new types of lower power computing (wearables, IoT, etc),
it's unclear if <a href="http://smus.com/ebb-of-the-web/">browsers will be as ubiquitous</a> as they are
today (at least in the near term). I'm very interested in seeing if and
how non-web platforms can embrace URLs.  How closely coupled are URLs to
HTML, and do they make sense without a presentation layer?</p>

  <a href='/ebb-of-the-web'><h1 class='title'>The ebb of the web</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Tech pundits like to lament that the web has <a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/04/07/the-decline-of-the-mobile-web/">no viable
future</a>, while web idealists hold that in fact the web is
totally fine, with a "too big to fail" <a href="http://schepers.cc/the-recline-of-the-mobile-web">sort of attitude</a>.</p>

<p>At the root of this disagreement are poorly defined terms. The web can
mean many different things to different people. Though it started from a
pretty abstract notion of a series of interlinked documents, it has now
evolved to refer to a very specific technology stack of hyperlinked HTML
documents styled with CSS, enhanced with JavaScript, all served on top
of HTTP. In light of an increasing movement away from desktop-style
computing, we've seen a big shift away from the web in mobile platforms. </p>

<p>Let's take apart this gob of web technology in light of the increasingly
complex landscape of computing and try to make sense of what the web is
and where it's going.</p>

  <div class='body'>
    <p>When the world wide web was first conceived, it was as a collection of
interlinked textual documents. Today's web is full of rich media.
YouTube and other video sites alone consume an enormous 53% of all
internet traffic. Web denizens often have an open audio player in one of
their tabs. Web-based photo sharing services such as Flickr are the most
common way of enjoying photos on our computers. The remote control,
foundations of which are attributed to everyone's favorite inventor
Nikola Tesla in <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US613809">patent US613809</a>, has been the preferred way of
controlling media for over half a century.</p>

<p>Yet the only way we can control all of this web media is via the
on-screen user interfaces that the websites provide. The web has no
remote control, and this is a big usability problem. Many use the
desktop versions of streaming services like Spotify and Rdio rather than
their web player, exclusively because of mac media key support. For
scenarios where you're far from the screen, like showing friends a
slideshow of photos on a TV, the lack of remote controllability is a
non-starter.</p>

<p>This post is a concrete proposal for what a remote controls for the web
should be like. To get a sense for how it might feel, try a <a href="http://borismus.github.io/media-control-prototype/">rough
prototype</a>.</p>

    <p>I just got back from Scotland, where I had the pleasure of attending
UIST 2013 in St. Andrews. This was my second time attending, and again
it was incredibly engaging and interesting content. I was impressed
enough to take notes just like <a href="http://smus.com/uist-2011/">my last UIST in 2011</a>. What
follows are my favorite talks with demo videos. I grouped them into
topics of interest: gestural interfaces, tangibles and GUIs.</p>
