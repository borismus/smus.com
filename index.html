  <div class='body'>
    <p>The process of interconnection is critical for creativity and divergent thought in general. Synthesis is how many new insights are generated. We humans have a knack for doing this, even in bed. Sleep intelligently interconnects newly gleaned information with prior memories. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep">Matt Walker</a> describes this as “a form of informational alchemy”. A study he cites has shown that discovering a hidden pattern in a problem set is thrice more likely during sleep.</p>

<p>In this post, I describe my early attempt use GPT-3 to emulate this nightly synthesis. A python script takes two randomly selected notes from my note corpus, and tries to divine a connection between them. The results are often nonsensical and surreal, and sometimes funny.</p>

<li><a href="https://aestheticsforbirds.com/2017/09/21/against-rotten-tomatoes/">Against Rotten Tomatoes</a> (<em>Aesthetics for Birds</em>) — Matt Strohl argues that crowdsourced movie rankings the Tomatometer are "mostly a bad thing". Designed to punish bad movies, they also punishes bold and distinct ones, reducing creative risk taking.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/i-can-feel-my-heart-hardening-as-the-war-goes-on">I Can Feel My Heart Hardening as the War Goes on</a> (<em>The Spectator</em>) — Pomerantsev considers the parallels the biblical story of Exodus to Russia's genocidal war on Ukraine as he travels home to celebrate Passover in his hometown Kiev.

However if you think it’s not so full of hills it’s insane to climb down from your comfortable perch!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-elon-musk-bought-twitter">Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter</a> (<em>New Yorker</em>) — Twitter is just one of many games Elon Musk is addicted to (we're living in a simulation, right?). Historically, he has created value for his companies by being unhinged on Twitter, but this is a dangerous game since many high-profile people have gotten in trouble for their tweets. Time to fix it!</li>

A hopeful peek at how "humans have the ability to not just allow biodiversity to flourish, but to be a part of it". Perhaps the dichotomy of hunter-gatherers vs. farmers is overstated?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/02/biosphere-planetary-intelligence-evolution/622867/">Is Earth Smart</a> <em>(The Atlantic)</em> — Building on the notion of a biosphere (life), the noosphere (intelligent life) and technosphere (technological systems created by intelligent life) present major challenges to survival. Just like the immature biosphere did not really hit its stride until the Great Oxygenation Event, our immature technosphere is actively destructive until an equivalent transition, argue the authors.</li>

<li><a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/vaccine-emoji-comes-to-life/">Vaccine Emoji Comes to Life</a> <em>(Emojipedia)</em> — In response to increased discourse about vaccinations and COVID, the blood-filled syringe emoji (💉) was updated to remove the blood to make it more universal. This raises a bunch of different questions: why is there only a white wine glass emoji, only a red one (🍷)? Famously, Apple changed its pistol emoji into a toy water gun (🔫) in 2016, causing widespread upset. When is it OK to repurpose existing emoji, and when is it not?</li>

At the same time, Ukraine has a long history of relative tolerance to Jews, and was the birthplace of many greats: politicians like David Ben-Gurion, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, writers like Isaac Babel, Sholom Alechem, Chaim Bialik. Many American greats descend directly from Ukranian Jews: Leonard Bernstein, Bob Dylan, Noam Chomsky, Steven Spielberg, Mel Brooks, Jon Stewart.</li>

<li><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo">Against longtermism</a> (<em>Aeon</em>) — Torres argues that an over-focus on the long term is dangerous because it ignores shorter term existential threats, and encourages endless growth, which itself might be the cause of our problems. As a fan of long term thinking, I found this very provocative. What is the synthesis between pollyannaish beliefs in technology and degrowth?</li>
<li><a href="https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81">Web3 is Self-Certifying</a> (<em>Jay Graber</em>) — Graber describes the concept of self-certifying data, which "enables trust to reside in the data itself, not in where you found it, allowing apps to move away from client-server architectures." Examples of protocols that enable this include git, BitTorrent, IPFS, and SSB.</li>
<li><a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun">What’s the Point If We Can’t Have Fun?</a> (<em>David Graeber</em>) – In a rambling article, Graeber highlights Kropotkin's argument that species that cooperate most effectively tend to be the most competitive in the long run. Kropotkin argues that animal cooperation often has nothing to do with survival or reproduction, but is a form of pleasure in itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/">Feynman and The Connection Machine</a> (<em>Long Now</em>) — A sometimes touching vignette of Richard Feynman, as seen by Danny Hillis, who founded Thinking Machines to build the world's fastest parallel supercomputers in the 1980s. Nobody really knew how to build computers back then, so the problem was left to amateurs like Hillis and Feynman.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/">The Internet Is Just Investment Banking Now</a> (<em>The Atlantic</em>) — Argues that Web3 is “the most honest turn of the internet epoch”: many things in our everyday life have become financialized, and while Web2 entrepreneurs have tried to hide that behind a facade of idealism, the new world of crypto at last makes the financialization explicit.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a81c934c-cb31-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0">Why Cisco’s ‘spin-ins’ never caught on</a> (<em>Financial Times</em>) — In the 90's, Cisco pioneered the model of 'spin-ins': a group of employees would leave Cisco and form a new company with well defined short-term goals, which if achieved, required Cisco to acquire the venture and possibly breed resentment from less entrepreneurial peers. On the other hand, the downside for the entrepreneurs was also quite high, since they would end up with nothing if no acquisition took place.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/2022/february-links/#">Is Old Music Killing New Music?</a> (<em>Ted Gioia</em>) — Top 40 charts, Grammy Awards, and other incarnations of mainstream pop culture seem to be losing their cultural cache. Instead, songs most in demand are by musicians in their 70s and 80s, if not already dead.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/can-you-warm-yourself-with-your-mind">Can You Warm Yourself with Your Mind?</a> (<em>New Yorker</em>) — Studies in Nature show that advanced practitioners of g-tummo meditation can raise their core temperature by 1-2°C, or their extremities by around 10°C. This is done by contracting abdominal and pelvic muscles and visualizing a flame rising from below the navel to the top of the head.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306">Why the Web Won't Be Nirvana (1995)</a> (<em>Newsweek</em>) — A cantankerous skeptic dumps on the future of the web, producing a litany of predictions which are wrong to various degrees. Revisiting pundits from the past is a useful exercise that reminds us just how difficult the future is to predict.</li>
<li><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/a-moment-of-clarity">A Moment of Clarity</a> (<em>Noah Smith</em>) — In addition to astute observations on the eve of Russia's war on Ukraine, Smith describes a clear headedness on shared American values that surely must have been felt internally, even by adherents of "warmed-over Chomsky".</li>

    <p>My latest <a href="/ai-note-garden-summarizer">AI gardener apprentice</a> finds pairs of notes that aren't explicitly linked, but maybe ought to be. This project was inspired by the human subconscious, which creates, cements, and removes neural connections during sleep.</p>

<p>Like a sleeping brain, my python script runs nightly, scouring my note garden for related notes. The end result is a list of the most similar notes pairs in the garden, based on semantic similarity. I found the results to be illuminating, and a real-time version with solid UX would be a central feature of my <a href="/file-systems-for-thought">system for thought</a>.</p>

  <a href='/notes/2021/article-highlights-of-2021/'><h1 class='title'>Article highlights of 2021</h1></a>
  <div class='body'>
    <p>Following my yearly tradition (<a href="/notes/2020/article-highlights-of-2020/">2020</a>,
<a href="/notes/2019/article-highlights-of-2019/">2019</a>, and
<a href="/notes/2021/article-highlights-of-2021/notes/2019/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>), here were my favorite articles from 2021.
It's hard to come up with coherent groupings, but overall I definitely read more
about emergence, evolution, equilibrium and complexity-related stuff. I tried to
make sense of Russia, China and where the US sits in the new world order.
Notably, I read a lot of <a href="https://constructionphysics.substack.com">Construction
Physics</a>, as if preparing for an
ambitious but unspecified building project.</p>

<p>I may have overindexed on articles and non-fiction books this year, at the
expense of reading novels. This is at odds with my stated belief in the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Power_of_Fiction">Power of Fiction</a>. Looking back at my <a href="/books">book list</a>, I only read two fiction
books the whole year — possibly an all-time low. My aim for 2022 is to double
down on reading for pleasure, relieving pressure to capture every insight.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
