      <p>One of my ongoing projects is called smusique, a mobile web-based sheet
music viewer. The application was designed for tablets, enabling a
rich browsing experience through sheet music. Though some sheet
music is encumbered by licenses, most of the classic stuff is legally
available online via sheet music databases such as the <a href="http://imslp.org">Petrucci
Library</a> at <a href="http://imslp.org">imslp.org</a>.

<p>While the focus of my project was to design and develop a delightful
tablet-based interface for sheet music, I needed to solve some technical
problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Figure out how to deal with PDFs in the browser.</li>
<li>Create or find a database with a large enough corpus of searchable
sheet music.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read on to find out how I solved these problems using the AppEngine
conversion API and through a Chrome extension that does client-side
scraping.</p>

<h2>Dealing with PDFs</h2>

<p>Since digital sheets are largely in PDF format, I needed some solution
for showing PDFs inside a web user interface. Unfortunately
showing PDFs inline is pretty much impossible using today's web. Ideally,
the browser would have support for something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="something.pdf" page="3" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this functionality simply doesn't exist in a widely supported
fasion. Given how important showing PDFs is for my application, I
needed a workaround. A few options came to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attempt to show PDFs in an iframe, and programatically scroll to the
right position based on the page number.</li>
<li>Convert PDFs on the client side using something like <a href="http://andreasgal.com/2011/06/15/pdf-js/">PDFJS</a></li>
<li>Build my own PDF conversion server</li>
</ol>

<p>I experimented briefly with the first approach and unsurprisingly found
mixed levels of browser support for PDF rendering inside iframes. Some mobile
browsers allowed PDFs to be opened within iframes, but exhibited
unexpected scaling behavior, could not be programmatically scrolled, or
both.</p>

<p>Did not seriously consider PDFJS as a solution, judging that running PDF
conversion in a mobile web browser would be prohibitively slow.</p>

<p>Just as I was bracing to take the plunge and write my own
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>-based conversion API running on Django/Slicehost, I
discovered the very new <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/conversion/overview.html">AppEngine conversion API</a>.</p>

<h2>The conversion API</h2>

<p>Turns out that AppEngine provides a new experimental <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/conversion/overview.html">file format
conversion API</a>. It allows you to map from a variety of input file
formats to a variety of outputs, including PDF to PNGs (one per page),
which is exactly what I wanted. The full list of conversion paths is
available in <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/conversion/overview.html">the docs</a>. Some of the more exciting
features include image to text conversions via OCR, and generating images
from HTML.</p>

<p>My conversion was really straight forward to implement:</p>

<pre><code>def convert_pdf(self, pdf_data):
    """Converts PDF to PNG images. Returns an array of PNG data."""
    asset = conversion.Asset('application/pdf', pdf_data, 'sheet.pdf')
    conversion_request = conversion.Conversion(asset, 'image/png')
    result = conversion.convert(conversion_request)
    if result.assets:
        return [asset.data for asset in result.assets]
    else:
        raise Exception('Conversion failed: %d %s'
                % (result.error_code, result.error_text))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the API methods recently changed (maybe in AppEngine 1.6?)
from <code>conversion.ConversionRequest</code> to <code>conversion.Conversion</code>. I should
have expected breaking changes since the conversion API is still
experimental, but it stumped me for a little while anyway.</p>

<p>The API works pretty well, but doesn't provide much meaningful feedback
if running in the dev server. So far I've only managed to overload the
conversion service a few times with very large (eg. ~100 page) PDFs.
That said, a lot of sheet music is incredibly long, especially in an
orchestral setting. So, if I was doing this for production, I would
probably need to build a custom solution.</p>

<p>One other caveat with this approach is that I have no idea how much
money I would be charged for using this service. Conversion is quite
intensive, and given the recently increased rates, I would be wary.</p>

<p>Once the images are converted, I upload them to an Amazon S3 instance
where I keep my data. To do this, I use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/code/134">S3.py</a>, a really simple
library for interacting with Amazon S3:</p>

<pre><code>def upload_helper(self, path, data, contentType):
    conn = S3.AWSAuthConnection(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
    options = {'x-amz-acl': 'public-read', 'Content-Type': contentType}
    response = conn.put(DEFAULT_BUCKET, path, S3.S3Object(data), options)
    return URL_FORMAT % {'bucket': DEFAULT_BUCKET, 'path': path}
</code></pre>

<p>The full code for the AppEngine server is open source on <a href="https://github.com/borismus/smusique-uploader">github</a>.</p>

<h2>Client-side scraping</h2>

<p>Unfortunately IMSLP doesn't provide a useful API out of the box. I
wasn't ambitious enough to create a full API for it, but needed some
interim solution. I figured that for a demo, it wouldn't be such a
terrible experience to have to seed the database with the repertoire you
were interested in if it was easy enough to do.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, one might write a little scraper utility in their favorite
scripting language. However, scraping HTML from python (or any other
scripting language for that matter) is really not my favorite activity.
Additionally, relying on the command line excludes the target audience
(musicians) for this application.</p>

<p>As a workaround, I came across a potentially interesting idea:
client-side scraping with a Chrome extension. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to scrape part of a corpus of data that's available
through a website, but want to let the user decide which parts they are
interested in. Simply use a Chrome extension that injects code into the
target page, fetches the interesting part of the DOM using selectors and
perhaps jQuery for convenience, and then uploads the data to some
server. I used <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html">content scripts</a> for this purpose. In the manifest, the
entry looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>"content_scripts": [{
  "matches": ["http://imslp.org/wiki/*"],
  "js": ["imslp.js"],
  "css": ["imslp.css"]
}]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, <code>imslp.js</code> does the scraping, which can happen automatically as a
user navigates through a page, or by adding extra elements to the page.
This simple IMSLP scraper creates a "send to smusique" button beside
each PDF on IMSLP:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6YhZ2.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>Once clicked, <code>imslp.js</code> gets the URL to fetch, extracts all of the meta
data of the current piece via CSS selectors, and makes a cross-domain
request to the converter with all of this information.</p>

<p>This approach is much harder to prevent than traditional, server side
scraping. Although setting UserAgent restrictions is futile, many sites
use JavaScript to render their content, and serve up a content-free
page. In contrast, there's very little a content provider can do to
protect themselves from client side scraping, making this a very
powerful technique. If the content is in the DOM, it can be extracted.</p>

<p>The source of the extension is somewhat messy but available also on
<a href="https://github.com/borismus/smusique-extension">github</a>.</p>
