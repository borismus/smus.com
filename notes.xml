      <div>
        <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year again! Following <a href="/notes/2019/article-highlights-of-2019/">last year's
summary</a>, here were my top reads for
2020. Last year I vowed to read fewer articles because they felt way more junky
than books do. I haven't changed my mind on this matter, but I was compelled to
try to understand this especially unusual year.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1>Education</h1>

<ul>
<li>An elite private school in Sydney, Australia, the alma mater of three prime ministers, banned laptops in 2016 and required students to handwrite essays through the tenth grade: the headmaster said the school found money spent on interactive white boards, laptops, and the associated software was a total waste. <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/">Rotten STEM: How Technology Corrupts Education</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21051869/indoor-air-pollution-student-achievement">Installing Air Filters in Classrooms Has Surprisingly Large Educational Benefits</a></li>
<li>The best methods are therefore those that supply comprehensible input in low anxiety situations, containing messages that students really want to hear. These methods do not force early production in the second language. <a href="https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html">Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Invention</h1>

<ul>
<li>Consolidation. Today’s cloud and mobile companies — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google — may very well be the GM, Ford, and Chrysler of the 21st century. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/">The End of the Beginning</a></li>
<li>Saul Griffith remains impressive. <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20100201/saul-griffiths-house-of-cool-ideas.html">Saul Griffith's House of Cool Ideas</a></li>
<li>What if the government bought the most valuable patents from its inventors, thus unlocking whole industries for more innovation? Main problem is how to price them. <a href="https://www.tenentrepreneurs.org/blog/innovation-eyes-on-the-prize">Innovation: Eyes on the Prize</a></li>
<li>More and more online activity is sinking into the cozyweb (away from public internet). <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">The Extended Internet Universe</a></li>
<li>We overestimate the impact of technological progress but underestimate the impact of cultural and social shifts. <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/why-futurism-has-a-cultural-blindspot-rp">Why Futurism Has a Cultural Blindspot</a></li>
<li>Unimportant problems are often more fun to work on, and ultimately you never know how important they really are. <a href="http://yosefk.com/blog/work-on-unimportant-problems.html">Work on unimportant problems</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Self help</h1>

<ul>
<li>A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier. <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice</a></li>
<li>When a difficulty comes your way, you should feel proud and excited, like “a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck.” <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/how-to-be-a-stoic">How to Be a Stoic</a></li>
<li>Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">What You'll Wish You'd Known</a></li>
<li>Rationality used to be this capacious concept that included reasonableness, but no longer. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/20/21068423/rationality-behavioral-economics-psychology-reasonable-decisions">Is rationality overrated?</a></li>
<li>It now feels okay to have an ordinary life, to not make big contributions, to be an ordinary person. I never felt like that before. <a href="https://edelwax.medium.com/narcissism-4c314beb39eb">Narcissism</a></li>
<li>Leonardo da Vinci wrote: …the more minutely you describe, the more you will confuse the mind of the reader and the more you will remove him from knowledge of the thing described. Therefore it is necessary to make a drawing. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200910-the-benefits-of-note-taking-by-hand">The Benefits of Note-Taking by Hand</a></li>
<li>They offer conceptual scaffolding for answering what I consider to be the most important question of our time: <em>How can we be good ancestors?</em>. By 01700 most clocks had minute hands and by 01800 second hands were standard. <a href="https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/six-ways-to-think-long-term-da373b3377a4">Six Ways to Think Long-term</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Software</h1>

<ul>
<li>Google's new triumvirate: Mr. Pichai, Mr. Kent Walker, and Ms. Porat. <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/07/30/googles-problems-are-bigger-than-just-the-antitrust-case">Google’s problems are bigger than just the antitrust case</a></li>
<li>Maybe something has changed about the nature of innovation, at least in software. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/why-silicon-valley-and-big-tech-dont-innovate-anymore/604969/">Silicon Valley Abandons the Culture That Made It the Envy of the World</a></li>
<li>People are switching from Go to Rust. I haven't switched to Go yet! <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">Why Discord is switching from Go to Rust</a></li>
<li>There certainly will be $10 billion dollar companies started within segments slow to adopt technology: legal tech, construction, agriculture, and mining are all prime candidates for massive new technology entrants. <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish">When Tailwinds Vanish</a></li>
<li>A deep look into Clubhouse, with lots of interesting hot takes. <a href="https://divinations.substack.com/p/inside-the-clubhouse">Inside the Clubhouse</a></li>
<li>Proximity Chat: you have an avatar or icon that can move around a virtual space. There are two broad metaphors behind proximity chat platforms: table-based and map-based. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-parties-proximity-chat/">A Mission to Make Virtual Parties Actually Fun</a></li>
<li>Because information is formless, the metaphors we use to describe it are particularly powerful: a highway, cyber-space, surfing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/20/6046003/a-history-of-metaphors-for-the-internet">A History of Metaphors for the Internet</a></li>
<li>We were spoiled by the old, weird Google that did things like Books because they could, throwing it in the teeth of the publishers, or Wave, an experiment in interactivity that in many ways is still ahead of its time. They did things because they hadn’t been done. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/rip-google-music-one-of-the-companys-last-examples-of-generosity/">RIP Google Music</a></li>
<li>Should you join a big company or start a startup? This frequently debated question paints a picture of a world where the only choice is between being a cog at a giant semi-monopoly, or taking investment money in the hopes of one day growing to be head cog at a giant semi-monopoly. <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">Small tech</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Culture</h1>

<ul>
<li>Half of single adults – and a majority of single women – are not on the dating market <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/">Nearly Half of U.S. Adults Say Dating Has Gotten Harder for Most People in the Last 10 Years</a></li>
<li>Why don't science fiction and fantasy take root in Israeli soil? Maybe it's because tying SF to the Torah would lead to becoming a mini Salman Rushdie. Maybe it's because Israel first appeared in a work of fantasy - The Jewish State by Herzl. <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/1.5472801">Never-never land</a></li>
<li>The personal lives of science fiction writers. Isaac Asimov died of AIDS, and Arthur C. Clarke was gay. Three rules and you're out. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/01/isaac-asimovs-throwback-literary-legacy/605815/">Isaac Asimov’s Throwback Vision of the Future</a></li>
<li>From most quarters of Japan there emanates a vaguely-defined, yet distinct fear and loathing of the internet (c. 2009, likely obsolete) <a href="http://neojaponisme.com/2009/05/19/the-fear-of-the-internet/">The Fear... of the Internet</a></li>
<li>Kvitko, on the other hand — like many of his compatriots — sketches portraits of children with absent or incompetent parents. They must overcome this deficiency by falling back on their own internal resources as well as those of the Soviet state, the ultimate dispenser of care and guidance. <a href="https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/pb-daily/papa-stalin-and-the-happy-family">Papa Stalin and the Happy Family</a></li>
<li>I, like Gibson, have absolutely no idea what the physical world will be like in sixty years. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/16/how-william-gibson-keeps-his-science-fiction-real">How William Gibson Keeps His Science Fiction Real</a></li>
<li>I learned a lot about bears. <a href="https://www.grizzlytimes.org/single-post/2018/12/18/Bear-Dreaming-Of-Wonder-in-Winter">Bear Dreaming: Of Wonder in Winter</a></li>
<li>I am trying to be a good novelist, and hoping that people will forgive me for being a bad correspondent. <a href="https://www.nealstephenson.com/why-i-am-a-bad-correspondent.html">Neal Stephenson - Why I Am a Bad Correspondent</a></li>
<li>Some $40 bottles of Okanagan cabernet sauvignon have sold for nearly $1,000 in China. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/19/world/canada/british-columbia-wine-Okanagan-Valley.html">Canada’s Napa Valley Seeks Elusive Audience: Canadian Wine Drinkers</a></li>
<li>This value is known as 公德心: in Mandarin, gongdexin; in Japanese, kootokushin; in Korean, kongdkshim; and in English, public-spiritedness. <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/meanings-face-masks-emma-teng-0819">Historian Emma Teng on Face Masks</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Medicine</h1>

<ul>
<li>It was thought to be caused by noxious air — “malaria”, for example, literally means “bad air". <a href="https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-a-breath-of-fresh">Age of Invention: A Breath of Fresh Air</a></li>
<li>The typical development time for a vaccine against a new disease is over five years. We've done really well this time around. <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Pandemic-Innovation">The first modern pandemic</a></li>
<li>We must immediately begin random sampling of the population using both PCR testing that tells up about active infections and antibody tests that informs about who has been infected in the past. <a href="https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2020/04/flying-blind-on-coronavirus-why-random.html">Flying Blind on Coronavirus: Why Random Testing is so Important</a></li>
<li>Rick bought his own qPCR machine and thinks that this is the future of biotech. He may well be right! <a href="https://medium.com/@RickByers/the-dawn-of-personal-biotech-cb0af0d52e4c">The dawn of personal biotech</a></li>
<li>Countries have two options: either they fight it hard now or they will suffer a massive epidemic. (May 28) <a href="https://tomaspueyo.medium.com/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56">Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance</a></li>
<li>Many health experts, including the surgeon general of the United States, told the public simultaneously that masks weren’t necessary for protecting the general public and that health care workers needed the dwindling supply. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html">Why Telling People They Don’t Need Masks Backfired</a></li>
<li>You can apparently saturate an entire city with Tamiflu if the entire city had the bird flu. <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2020/04/04/how-society-can-overcome-covid-19">How society can overcome covid-19</a></li>
<li>The plague resurfaced roughly every 20 years from 1348 to 1665. 40 outbreaks in 300 years! And many more crazy pandemic stories. <a href="https://www.history.com/news/pandemics-end-plague-cholera-black-death-smallpox">How 5 of History's Worst Pandemics Finally Ended</a></li>
<li>But the warnings of thoughtful shutdown skeptics warrant careful study, not stigma rooted in the false pretense that they don’t have any plausible concerns or value human life. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/take-shutdown-skeptics-seriously/611419/">Take the Shutdown Skeptics Seriously</a></li>
<li>The obliteration of all microbes as often and aggressively as possible is not always appropriate. As with any medicine, more does not mean better. Not enough time to shower? Washing underarms, groin, and feet may actually be healthier. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/hygiene-is-overrated/612235/">You’re Showering Too Much</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Environment</h1>

<ul>
<li>Fire professionals should be considering ecology and picking their fights: letting fires that pose little risk burn through the stockpiles of fuels. Yet that’s not the mission. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen">They Know How to Prevent Megafires. Why Won’t Anybody Listen?</a></li>

<li>If Zincton is approved it will take eight years to build all phases. It would become the first brand new major ski resort in BC in almost half a century. <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/zincton-mountain-village">New major ski resort proposed for BC interior</a></li>
<li>Tree planting drones, tree planting robots, drones to map forests, and other surprising uses of advanced technology. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90504789/these-drones-can-plant-40000-trees-in-a-month-by-2028-theyll-have-planted-1-billion">These Drones Will Plant 40,000 Trees in a Month. By 2028, They’ll Have Planted 1 Billion</a></li>
<li>Only really huge declines in CO2 emissions, far greater that what is occurring during this lockdown period, will be necessary to really move the needle on global warming. <a href="https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2020/04/is-atmospheric-co2-declining-from-covid.html">Is Atmospheric CO2 Declining From the Covid Economic Collapse?</a></li>
<li>Tree planting can often worsen outcomes for everything from the number of bird, insect, and plant species to measures of canopy cover, tree density, and forest structure. Still haven't learned from SLAS? Nature knows best. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/is-it-better-to-plant-trees-or-let-forests-regrow-naturally/">Is It Better to Plant Trees or Let Forests Regrow Naturally?</a></li>

<h1>Economics</h1>

<ul>
<li>Seattle got rid of parking quotas and the requirement for property owners to live on site, and now allows two ADUs. <a href="https://www.sightline.org/2019/07/01/seattle-approves-best-backyard-cottages-rules-united-states/">Seattle Says Yes to the Best Rules in America for Backyard Cottages</a></li>
<li>Keynes once proposed that we could jump-start an economy by paying half the unemployed people to dig holes and the other half to fill them in. <a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/">Cory Doctorow: Full Employment</a></li>
<li>Open borders and mass immigration are a victory for the bosses. Andrew Carnegie in 1886 compared immigration to “a golden stream which flows into the country each year”. Interesting ITT-worthy material. <a href="http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/the-left-case-against-open-borders/">The Left Case against Open Borders</a></li>
<li>Airlines got a bailout. Parents are on their own. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/opinion/coronavirus-school-reopening.html">Remote School Is a Nightmare. Few in Power Care</a></li>
<li>Really old money. <a href="https://qz.com/694340/the-richest-families-in-florence-in-1427-are-still-the-richest-families-in-florence/">The richest families in Florence in 1427 are still the richest families in Florence</a></li>

<li>What the U.S. really needs to do is reconstitute its communities of engineering practice.

<li>I know the real San Francisco, and I know that its underlying issues do not differ dramatically from the problems facing the other rest of America or any other corner in our hyper-capitalistic planet. <a href="https://om.co/2020/11/24/on-not-leaving-san-francisco/">On Not Leaving San Francisco</a></li>

<li>Understanding where our modern standard of living comes from, at a basic level, is a responsibility of every citizen in an industrial civilization. <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/industrial-literacy">Industrial Literacy</a></li>
<li>The real unemployment rate (U-6) is a broader definition of unemployment than the official unemployment rate (U-3). In June 2020, it was 18%. It's down from the 22.8% rate in April. That's almost as bad as the 25% rate during the Great Depression. <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-real-unemployment-rate-3306198">What Is the Real Unemployment Rate?</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Politics</h1>

<ul>
<li>Behind the bluster and rhetoric of populist discourse there lies a deeper emotion: resentment. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/18/the-west-has-a-resentment-epidemic-populism/">The West Has a Resentment Epidemic</a></li>
<li>For Warren, the problem with modern American capitalism is that it is not nearly capitalist enough. It has been captured by special interests, which are strangling competition. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/12/elizabeth-socialist-understand-capitalism-pro-market-leftist/">Socialists Will Never Understand Elizabeth Warren</a></li>
<li>Unfortunately, the problem of nuclear arms is still very serious today. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2006/04/21/commentary/world-commentary/turning-point-at-chernobyl/">Turning point at Chernobyl by Gorbachev</a></li>
<li>One in five Millennials thinks the Communist Manifesto better “guarantees freedom and equality” than the Declaration of Independence and thinks society would be better off if the government abolished private property; one in six thinks the world would be better off if the Soviet Union were still around. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/youngs-dont-care-about-ussr/607249/">Young People Don’t Care About the U.S.S.R.</a></li>

<li>The goal of disinformation is not to dominate the informational space but to dilute it. “Flood the zone with shit,” was Steve Bannon’s infamous advice for dealing with the media. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/21/democracies-disinformation-russia-china-homegrown/">Democracies Can’t Blame Putin for Their Disinformation Problem</a></li>

<li>If you are not doing “antiracist work” you are ipso facto a racist. A terrifying sentiment. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/andrew-sullivan-is-there-still-room-for-debate.html">Is There Still Room for Debate?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/15/1004950/how-to-talk-to-conspiracy-theorists-and-still-be-kind/">How to talk to conspiracy theorists—and still be kind</a></li>
<li>Gentry classes are generally hereditary, and the Americans are no exception. Example: a single family owning seventeen McDonald’s franchises in eastern Tennessee, or enrich themselves from ownership of the third-biggest construction company in Bakersfield. <a href="https://patrickwyman.substack.com/p/american-gentry">American Gentry</a></li>
<li>Trump improved over his 2016 performance among Black women (+4 percentage points), Black men (+5), Latinas (+3) and Latinos (+4).” A third of Latino men, and a quarter of Latino women, picked Trump. Trump’s support was up among Asians and Muslims, and apparently doubled among self-identified LGBT voters. <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/11/09/america-has-serious-problems-its-time-to-stop-blaming-them-on-trumpism/">America Has Serious Problems. It’s Time to Stop Blaming Them on ‘Trumpism’</a></li>
<li>The composition of Trump’s followers, with a large minority of Latino voters and a nontrivial number of Black voters, makes their motivations more various and complicated than just racism. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/theres-no-escaping-who-we-have-become/616992/">Face the Bitter Truth</a></li>
<li>The problem is that neither side has shown any willingness or understanding to solve the structural problems that have brought about the current revolutionary situation. <a href="http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/america-in-november-2020-a-structural-demographic-view-from-alpha-centauri/">Structural-Demographic View from Alpha Centauri</a></li>

        <p>I’ve been reading and summarizing for five years now (cue Ratatat). I’m not sure that it’s helped much with retention, but at the very least, having an easily searchable corpus of my book-related notes is worthwhile.</p>

<p>A decent year for fiction, I finally read <a href="/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino/">Invisible Cities</a>, which I enjoyed not viscerally, but more as an art piece. I liked <a href="/books/the-fiddler-is-a-good-woman/">The Fiddler is a Good Woman</a> for the author’s ability to retell the same sordid tale from multiple perspectives. <a href="http://localhost:5500/books/diamond-age-by-stephenson-audio/">Diamond Age</a> was a collection of incredible ideas and surprisingly relevant for my job. I also enjoyed <a href="/books/hyperion-by-dan-simmons-audio/">Hyperion</a>, especially Sol Weintraub’s tale, which touched me deeply. <a href="/books/the-fifth-season-by-n-k-jemisin/">The Fifth Season</a> was interesting, but I have some identitarian reservations. I think my overall fiction highlight was <a href="/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio/">Homer’s Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson</a>.</p>

<p>I read two non-fiction books which were a little too extreme for my tastes: <a href="/books/deschooling-society-by-ivan-illich">Deschooling Society</a>, which just read like an angry and ill considered screed and <a href="/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl/">Radical Markets</a>, which had some really interesting ideas, but presented as a whole seemed ridiculous. I really enjoyed <a href="/books/timefulness-by-marcia-bjornerud-audio/">Timefulness</a>, a whirlwind overview of geology, and <a href="/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/">Range</a>, an ode to generalists. The standout non-fiction for me was <a href="/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott/">Seeing Like a State</a>, which will continue to turn over in my mind for years to come. I listened to fewer history lectures than usual, but can wholeheartedly recommend <a href="/books/the-story-of-medieval-england-audio/">The Story of Medieval England</a>. Instead, I focused on parenting books, which are pretty bad as a genre. That said, <a href="/books/the-new-father/">The New Father</a> served as a worthwhile companion to skim during the first year of Eliana’s life, and <a href="/books/yes-brain-by-siegel-and-bryson/">Yes Brain</a> had practical suggestions for digesting mindfulness into something that small children might be able to understand.</p>

<p>I also begun a new long-term book summarization project, which is to digest <a href="">Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery</a>, and visualize it as a Civ-style tech tree. Hopefully I’ll have something to report on that front in 2020!</p>

        <p>I’m still using Instapaper for reading online things, although in 2020, my aim is to read articles (even) less, in favor of books.</p>

<li>A charitable look at Post-modernism holds that there is no privileged lens with which to view the world; that even empiricism is suspect, because it too has a tendency to reproduce and reify the power structures in which in exists. <a href="https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2019/04/03/post-modernism-and-political-diversity/">https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2019/04/03/post-modernism-and-political-diversity/</a></li>

<li>The Baumol effect: “A violinist can always choose to stop playing violin, retrain for a while, and work in a factory instead. Maybe in 1826, when factory owners were earning $1.14/hour and violinists were earning $5/hour, so no violinists would quit and retrain. But by 2010, factory workers were earning $26.44/hour, so if violinists were still only earning $5 they might all quit and retrain.” <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/10/book-review-the-prices-are-too-dmn-high/">https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/10/book-review-the-prices-are-too-dmn-high/</a></li>

<li>Wikis are just editable web pages; Twitter is just a way of sharing very short form writing; and Facebook is just a way of sharing writing and pictures with friends. Indeed, writing itself is just a clever way of ordering a small number of symbols on a page.

<li>For middle-class and poor families, the picture is different.

        <p>I read and listened to a few <a href="/books">books</a> in 2018. My highlights include
speculative fiction stories from Chinese authors: <a href="/books/the-truth-of-fact-the-truth-of-feeling-by-ted-chiang/">Ted
Chiang</a>, <a href="/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/">Liu
Cixin</a>, <a href="/books/infinite-planets/">Ken Liu's translations
of</a>, Chen Qiufan, Xia Jia, Hao Jingfang. Also really
enjoyed <a href="/books/player-of-games-by-iain-m-banks/">Player of Games</a> and <a href="/books/darkness-at-noon-by-arthur-koestler-audio/">Darkness
at Noon</a>. On the non-fiction
front, I listened to two excellent history lectures: one on <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/">modern
China</a>, another on the <a href="/books/living-the-french-revolution-audio/">French
Revolution</a>. I also read a pair of
books describing cyclical views of history: <a href="/books/the-fourth-turning-by-howe-and-strauss/">The Fourth
Turning</a> and a more scientific
take, <a href="/books/war-and-peace-and-war-by-peter-turchin/">War and Peace and War</a>.
A standout non-fiction favorite was <a href="/books/impro-by-keith-johnstone/">Impro</a>,
which I will definitely be returning to.</p>

<p>Most of my internet reading happens through Instapaper, which affords me a 
handy chronicle of articles that I enjoyed. Here are a few of them (excerpts are
not endorsements):</p>

<li>Our choice is not between "regulation" and "no regulation." The code

them. It protects privacy, or promotes monitoring. <a href="https://harvardmagazine.com/2000/01/code-is-law-html">Code Is

<li>Today’s belief in ineluctable certainty is the true innovation-killer of our
age. In this environment, the best an audacious manager can do is to develop
small improvements to existing systems — climbing the hill, as it were, toward
a local maximum, trimming fat, eking out the occasional tiny innovation — like
city planners painting bicycle lanes on the streets as a gesture toward
solving our energy problems. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/10/stephenson-innovation-starvation/">Innovation

<li>Isaiah Berlin, sobered by the 20th century’s failed utopias, has argued for a
more modest liberal pluralism that makes room for multiple, genuinely
conflicting goods. Family and work, solidarity and autonomy, tradition and
innovation are really valuable, and really in tension <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now/554054/">When Truth and Reason

it without; I am in favor of kindness and you prefer concentration camps"

<li>The average net worth among adults in the 95th to 99th percentile is about
$1.7 million. Among the 0.1 percent, it’s about $60 million. Who, exactly, are

<li>To support triangulation, we recommend a shift to a contributorship model,
similar to the credits that roll at the end of a film — a long list of
individuals with their contributions described fully and specifically <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01023-3">Robust

(regardless of outcomes!) is a worthy contribution to society, full stop. <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research">The

<li>Various studies have identified cooperation as a core theme in popular
narratives across the world. ... nearly 80% of their tales concerned moral
decision making and social dilemmas <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180503-our-fiction-addiction-why-humans-need-stories">Our fiction addiction: Why humans need

<li>This means that the mistake must be at the root, at the very basis of human

where they get weird. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/how-make-big-decision.html">How to Make a Big

<li>Particularly sad is the belief that the majority of the homeless were drunks,
drug addicts, criminals or thieves. It is true that the category “homeless”
has come to include all of those people, but there are so many, many more who
are none of those things. <a href="https://crosscut.com/2018/09/why-i-started-giving-homeless">Why I started giving to the homeless</a></li>

grown men wanting to immerse themselves in fantasy worlds. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-magic-leap-con-1829716266">The Magic Leap

<li>The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and
discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to
sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every
day. That is real freedom. The alternative is unconsciousness, the
default-setting, the "rat race"-the constant gnawing sense of having had and
lost some infinite thing. <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/">This is Water</a></li>
<li>The big mistake in this pattern of failure is projecting your subjective lack
of comprehension onto the object you are looking at, as “irrationality.” We
make this mistake because we are tempted by a desire for legibility. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">A Big Little Idea Called Legibility</a></li>

    <title>Make twitter great again?</title>

      <div>
        <p>I used twitter the most while working in developer relations, mainly sharing
articles about web development that I thought deserved more attention. My feed
consisted of engineers, developer advocates, and web standards folks I
respected, all of whom had something interesting to say. Twitter was my interest
graph, in contrast with Facebook, which was just a poor facsimile of real life
relationships.</p>

<p>As my career and interests shifted, so did the people I followed on twitter.
I started following VR engineers, machine learning researchers, philosophers
and psychologists. But more tweeps meant more tweets. Soon I had a [twitter
list][smartpeople](https://twitter.com/borismus/lists/smartpeople) for people that I had reluctantly unfollowed. They had
interesting things to say, but said them too often.</p>

<p>Following someone on twitter is like having a direct line into their brain. If
they write about a subject you are passionate about, fantastic. If they have
broadly aligning interests, chances are they will turn you on to something neat,
or if you're lucky, life changing. Unfortunately, most of the time, twitter
brains are distracted, anxious, angry, or unhappy. Spastic tweet storms and
political ramblings deserve only one thing, a hearty unfollow.</p>

<p>Twitter's bad design decisions only compound the problem. In "Retweets Are
Trash", Alexis Madrigal <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/the-case-against-retweets/554078/">writes</a>, "When Twitter introduced a retweet
button, in 2009, suddenly one click could send a post careening through the
network. The automatic retweet took Twitter’s natural tendency for amplification
and cranked it up." Apparently it's not hard to globally disable retweets using
a <a href="https://medium.com/@Luca/how-to-turn-off-retweets-for-everyone-99dd835c10f8">crude hack</a>. Anecdotally, it seems to have made my feed a bit calmer.</p>

<p>A quick update on my <a href="http://smus.com/notes/2018/lynched-on-twitter/">white supremacist spam problem</a>. Time seems to
have sorted it out, and the remaining squawks have been muffled by twitter's
<a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169398">quality filter</a>. I also tried using Mastodon. It was a calming
experience at first, but when I followed a few people and dug around a little
bit, I was dismayed to see most design choices mirroring twitter's. I caught up
on RSS feeds, which I really like. But the RSS ecosystem continues to die. Of
nearly five hundred RSS feeds in my OPML file, more than half are broken links.
Occasionally the links are fixed, causing my reader to choke on a year's worth
of articles from a blog whose existence I've long forgotten about.</p>

<p>I can't quite decide whether or not to use twitter again. I keep thinking that I
once got a lot out of my original use of the platform. If I do return, I'll be
making use of the @reply quality filter, fully disable retweets, and unfollow
more aggressively. Whether this makes twitter great again remains to be seen.</p>

reply</a> I posted two
years ago was picked up by an account called Blue Check Watch, looking for
verified twitter accounts disparaging white people. As a result, my account has
become inundated by a hybrid human-bot army of white supremacist trolls. Most
responses accused me of anti-white racism, completely missing what I thought was
obviously a sarcastic tone. Sadly, many of the attacks are really nasty and
ad-hominem. One user
<a href="https://twitter.com/CascadianDennis/status/1033190496456269824">posted</a> "Why do

<a href="https://twitter.com/NationDixie/status/1033395244014944256">anti-semitic</a>
messages that do not bear repeating here. Ominously, I received an email from
Twitter informing me that they have investigated <strong>my tweet</strong>, flagged for violating
their TOS and "have not taken any action at this time."</p>

<p>Writing my snarky tweet two years ago, I was a bit uncertain whether it was
within the bounds of social acceptability. A white guy telling another
white guy that white guys are "the worst", was intended to poke a bit of fun at
the self-flaggelation associated with progressive politics. There is only so
much self-censorship one can do while still remaining authentic. In a surprising
twist, my tweet was offensive to a group I hadn't even thought about in a way I
could not have predicted, two years after the fact.</p>

<p>Twitter lynchings are not new, but it's different when it happens to you. It has
not had any serious consequences (yet?), and until it does, I will continue to
view this as a funny story, and not something truly traumatic, as it is often
framed in the press. Still, this experience serves as a good reminder of a few
points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Twitter's UI for threaded conversations is terrible, and hardly anyone of my
virtual lynch mob even bothered to look to the tweet I was responding to.</li>
<li>My tweet was five words, twenty four characters. It was meant to be pithy,
because that is how twitter works. But brief posts beget brief responses,
which is fine between friends, but not fine when the whole world is watching.</li>
<li>Relatedly, sarcasm is hard to convey in this situation. Only two responses
suggested that maybe I was being sarcastic, imploring my attackers, "Don't be
lazy."</li>
<li>The fact that tweets have no expiry date means anything you have ever posted
can be used against you in surprising ways. It took two years for my tweet to
be picked up. James Gunn's incriminating posts were ten years old. Social
norms change quickly, and this is one argument in favor of ephemerality.</li>
<li>On that same note, it seems that the white supremacy movement has really
embraced the internet over the last couple of years in some sick symbiosis
with the POTUS. At the same time, it's striking that the result of someone's
pathetic search for anti-white sentiment yielded such a lackluster example.</li>
<li>Despite a general willingness for my views to be challenged, I don't have
energy or desire to engage with this mob. I made no attempts to respond to
any of my attackers. They appear to be victims of confirmation bias, stupid
and/or malicious, and I have little faith that they will listen.</li>
<li>There are some really nasty people on the internet. If triggered, they will
sherlock your religion, your employer, your family, and try to hit you where
it hurts the most.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lynchings aside, I've been trying to use twitter less in favor of consuming and
producing longer form content, like books, blogs, and conversations. Given that
my account is currently being inundated with anti-semitic spam, I have very
little incentive to continue using the service. One thing that has been keeping
me on the platform is the potential reach I can get through 6K followers. I
should remember that in the grand scheme of things, this is a small number, 5
orders of magnitude less than the lovely POTUS. I shouldn't grow attached.</p>

<p>And so, just in time for my tenth twitter anniversary, it's time for me to make
some changes. At the very least, I'll be taking a long break.</p>

        <p>Monism gives life meaning through a single all-encompassing doctrine. Examples
include some political ideologies, religions, and [variants of
rationality][chapman-rationality](https://meaningness.com/non-theistic-eternalism). History has not been kind to those that have
fervently followed such doctrines. But once you see flaws in Monism, it can be
tempting to decide that life has <a href="https://meaningness.com/extreme-examples-eternalism-and-nihilism">no meaning at all</a>, falling
into the trap of Nihilism.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WXdU3ef.gif" alt="Stuck" /></p>

<p>The choice between these two extremes is a false one. [Rationalists know
this][third-alternative](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/erGipespbbzdG5zYb/the-third-alternative). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way">Buddhists know this</a>. Philosophers know
this too. David Chapman writes a <a href="https://meaningness.com/">whole blog</a> devoted to exploring
the space in between. But I have found <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html">Isaiah Berlin</a>'s synthesis to
be the most compelling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sobered by the 20th century’s failed utopias, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html">Berlin</a>
  argued for a more modest liberal pluralism that makes room for multiple,
  genuinely conflicting goods. Family and work, solidarity and autonomy, tradition
  and innovation are really valuable, and really in tension.  – [Alison
  Gopnik][gopnik](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now/554054/)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this view, we are condemned to an eternal balancing act, sometimes peering
too far into the meaningless abyss, and other times relaxing too deeply into
meaningful certainty. On balance, I hope to end up in this difficult middle.</p>

      <div>
        <p><a href="https://pessimists.co/">Pessimists archive</a> is a podcast that chronicles
pessimistic reactions to emerging technology as it was becoming mainstream.
Technology here is defined broadly, covering a broad range of topics: bikes,
coffee, pinball machines, vaccines, recorded music. The podcast is very
accessible, focused more on social and psychological issues and less on the tech
itself. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>In response to unreasonable technological enthusiasm ever present in my
industry, I have myself tended towards pessimism. After we launched Cardboard,
my small HCI team in Google Research became the de facto home of VR at Google.
Once word got out, engineers and designers flocked to our ranks, self selecting
for interest in VR. Suddenly I was surrounded by hundreds of VR enthusiasts,
while I was skeptical about the vision of VR as <a href="https://youtu.be/dxbh-TM5yNc?t=3m">"the last
platform"</a> and concerned about the social
implications of broad VR adoption.</p>

<p>I began to see myself as <a href="https://www.quora.com/World-War-Z-2013-movie/World-War-Z-2013-movie-Do-the-Israelis-really-have-a-10th-man-doctrine">the tenth
man</a>,
posing the question: what if VR isn't really a thing? I ended up much more
excited about <a href="https://atap.google.com/spotlight-stories/">Spotlight Stories</a>
without a headset, thought a bunch about augmented reality through audio, and
became increasingly alienated from my colleagues gushing with optimism, rushing
home to play Vive games in their carefully instrumented basements. This podcast
would sure have helped me put my VR pessimism into perspective. </p>

<p>One critique I had of the podcast concept is hindsight bias. All of the
technologies covered by Pessimists Archive ended up being successful, and time
has proven the doubters wrong. But how many emerging technologies were
successfully booed out of existence, or simply rejected by the market? And how
many market successes come at a significant cost that prescient pessimists
warned us about?  TV and smartphones come to mind.</p>

<p>That said, I highly recommend the podcast series. The episodes are short,
entertaining, and informative. I feel better equipped to recognize and overcome
the traps that ensnared previous generations of techno pessimists.</p>

    <title>How rationalists can win</title>

    <updated>2018-04-12T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/notes/2018/how-rationalists-can-win/</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The belief that <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_is_systematized_winning">"rationalists should win"</a> is widely held in the
rationalist community. So: does being a good rationalist actually help you win?
Certainly in some domains, like engineering and science, which focus on
quantification, systematization, and prediction. There, having a hyper-rational
mindset is clearly an advantage. As for winning at life, which I will take that
to mean leading to greater success in survival, evolution, and human
flourishing, I don't think rationality helps very much.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The rationalist doctrine always favors quantification and optimization over
intuition. From a rationalist perspective, humans are buggy <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/01/marvin-minskys-marvelous-meat-machine/">computers made of meat</a>. We are full of cognitive biases that cloud our judgement, and
cause us to do reliably poorly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox">simple tasks</a> related to
probability. So even if you don't really know what probability to assign, it's
better to <a href="https://putanumonit.com/">"put a number on it"</a> and then <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply">”shut up and multiply”</a>.</p>

<p>The problem with the above approach lies with the words "systematic" and
"predictable". Herb Simon's idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality">Bounded Rationality</a>, suggests that
our human ability to be rational, to systematize and predict is inherently
limited. These limitations may come from our limited brains, but may also be
fundamental in nature. Chaos theory makes it really difficult for even the most
advanced computers to predict even simple systems, such as the position of the
<a href="http://awesci.com/double-pendulum-and-why-we-can-never-predict-weather/">double pendulum</a> after a small amount of time.</p>

<p>The world is far more complicated than one pendulum attached to another.
Insisting on making every decision in life based on a <a href="/making-better-decisions/">series of sound logical steps</a>, one quickly becomes paralyzed by the
complexity of myriad tiny choices. Gerd Gigerenzer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_rationality">ecological rationality</a> suggests that many things that appear illogical are actually
done for good reasons, ultimately leading to good outcomes. This idea is
directly at odds with the rational propensity for first knowing what is true
(epistemic rationality), and then making decisions in a series of logical steps.</p>

<p>Instead of being dogmatic about rationality, we should be better
consequentialists. Consider outcomes. Are rationalists more satisfied with their
lives than non-rationalists? Are they more productive?  Do they have fewer
regrets later in life? Do they have better relationships? Make more money?  Have
happier children? Impact their domains of knowledge more effectively?</p>

<p>It <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/02/are-the-amish-unhappy-super-happy-just-meh/">is hard to answer</a> the above questions definitively, but suppose we
had solid data, and it was clear that, Buddhists were more relaxed, Protestants
more productive, Amish happier, and Singularitarians more innovative than other
groups. Imagine we had a sense of expected consequences of being an adherent to
each type of lifestyle. Imagine further that you could take a personality test
and see how likely you would be to benefit from each. Then the rational thing to
do would be to choose one of the irrational doctrines to follow based on
expected outcomes if you were an adherent.</p>

<p>Of course, you want to remain open to changing your mind, so allow yourself to
indulge fully your chosen beliefs for a while. At the top of every year, wake up
as late as your doctrine allows and nurse your hangover, unless your beliefs
prevented you from drinking the night before. If your beliefs favors ice baths,
partake in the polar bear plunge. Then take a moment to re-evaluate your
beliefs.</p>

        <p>It's a fact that men greatly outnumber women in software engineering. As for
why, there is a fundamental disagreement between social constructivists and
evolutionary psychologists. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>Constructivists say that it’s because of systematic oppression against women.
Boys in the 80s grew up with computers, learned programming and made life a
living hell for their female classmates in CS101. <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding">Planet Money</a> has the
scoop. Evolutionary psychologists say that it’s because men and women have
evolutionarily caused <a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/08/10/the-google-memo-what-does-the-research-say-about-gender-differences/">differences in interests</a> and point to studies
indicating that progressive countries have larger gender representation gaps
because women are free to choose <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/07/contra-grant-on-exaggerated-differences/">careers based on interest</a>. I find
it likely that both positions contribute in part to the gender representation
disparity. Compelling arguments can be made for and against both, and both are
rooted in academic disciplines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">that are dangerously squishy</a>. As a
result, I don’t think we currently have a good scientific way of determining
this.</p>

<p>So what; science, schmience! Followers of the evo psych and constructivism are
at war. One continuously pisses the other off with their inflamatory rhetoric.
It is true that white males are historically privileged, but hammering “white
male privelege” into their heads predictably puts white males into a defensive
stance. Similarly, discussing how evo psych means that women are less interested
and therefore less capable of software engineering will predictably annoy
females, especially those rightfully proud of their software engineering
prowess, and tired of dealing with similar allegations for their whole career.</p>

<p>I've spent way too much time reading and thinking about this lately, and it
saddens me to conclude that the wisest course of action is to avoid discussing
this topic entirely (oops, too late). Scott Aaronson, Sarah Constantin and
Stacey Jeffery propose a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3389">respectful truce</a> between the two camps.
Advocates of evolutionary psychology should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do everything they can to foster diversity, including by creating environments
  that are welcoming for women, and by supporting affirmative action, women-only
  scholarships and conferences, and other diversity policies and also agree
  never to talk in public about possible cognitive-science explanations for
  gender disparities in which careers people choose, or overlapping bell curves,
  or anything else potentially inflammatory."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, social constructivists should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>avoid libelling [white men] as misogynist monsters, who must be scaring all
  the women away with their inherently gross, icky, creepy, discriminatory
  brogrammer maleness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truce?</p>

      <div>
        <p>Despite the obnoxious title, <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/07/15/popularity-addiction-thompson-alter/">this a16z podcast</a> was unusually insightful.</p>

<p>One big theme in the podcast can be summarized as an end of endings: a trend
away from one story with a coherent, finite arc, towards something neverending.
Amorphous TV shows like Lost, as well as Hollywood's discovery that a coherent
franchise like Star Wars can be milked for many more dollars are examples of
this. The stats backs it up: Hollywood moved from 10% of the hits of the 90s
being sequels to 50% today, as can be seen in the <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/">box office data</a>.
Looking at TV shows through the same lens, each show is a one hour long movie,
followed by tens of sequels. And successful franchises aim to immerse their fans
(especially kids) into their universe with figurines, games, lunch boxes, bed
sheets.</p>

<p>The end of endings also shows up in user interfaces, and is epitomized by the
infinite scroller. Millions of souls fixate on the next pretty picture, the next
baby picture, the next outrage. Entertainment that never ends!</p>

<p>This is interesting in the context of attention. In the realm of meditation, the
challenge is to focus on something mundane, like your breath. In the realm of
entertainment, the challenge is to snap out of an immersive world carefully
constructed to consume your attention for as long as possible.</p>

      <div>
        <p>I recently enjoyed a podcast about intelligence, aliens and learning where Kevin
Kelly was interviewed by Sam Harris. Here are some things I liked about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kelly makes a great argument that with text we already have no way of knowing
what is true. We have to rely on the source. My fears of audio and video fake
news are reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>It's obvious that the world is changing quickly, which means lifelong learning
is necessary. One thing I haven't systematically understood is how I learn
best. How would you even figure that out?</p></li>
<li><p>Chimpanzees are amazing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A">short term spatial
memory</a>, and do better than
humans in these cognitive tasks on average.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, the best Chess players are human-computer hybrids. Harris claims
that computers alone will eventually be better than these hybrids, but 
his claim that "the ape will just be adding noise" is unsubstantiated.</p></li>
<li><p>About mid-way, the two discuss the analogy between AI and aliens. I haven't
thought of this either. But I wondered how salient that analogy was given that we
have a largely shared environment with whatever AIs we create. To the extent
that the AIs truly are alien, I wonder how much of a unifying force these
alien AIs could be for humanity. </p></li>
<li><p>I strongly agreed with Kelly when he says that building machine systems
enhances our self-understanding. Building VR rendering and head tracking
systems, you benefit from some human visual perception basics. Human
psychology is critical for building user interfaces. You need an understanding
of how human hearing works to build good lossy audio compression.</p></li>
<li><p>An interesting thought experiment that superscedes Asimov's laws of robotics:
what if we built AGIs that were terribly worried about what people think. Then
we reduce the machine menace problem to merely the evils of humanity. </p></li>
</ul>

        <p>I highly recommend two <a href="http://loveandradio.org/2014/02/the-silver-dollar/">podcast</a> <a href="http://loveandradio.org/2017/02/how-to-argue/">episodes</a> on the theme "how to argue",
featuring Daryl Davis, <em>the</em> black friend of white supremacists. Mr. Davis is
remarkably lucid in dealing with very difficult issues, and presents great tips
for convincing the inconvincible. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gather your information. Understand their position as well as you do your
own. Expect to hear things you will disagree with and keep your cool. </p></li>
<li><p>Invite them. Have a conversation not a debate. Debates get people's guards
up. Instead seek to understand them. People want to be heard and speak their
mind freely without retaliation. </p></li>
<li><p>Look for commonality. You can find something in 5 minutes and then build on
it. Look to other issues. Politics? As you find more commonality the
differences matter less. </p></li>
<li><p>Talking is not fighting. When the talking stops the ground becomes fertile
for violence (cf. Sam Harris). The longer you talk the more commonalities you
can find. </p></li>
<li><p>Patience.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a good first impression. Be respectful.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't be condescending or insulting even when you hear things you don't like.
Expect opinions that are ridiculous and facts that are wrong. Keep cool. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't explain somebody else's movement. Let them explain it and address the
points that they themselves define. Let them finish and don't cut them off
even though you probably know a lot about their ideas already. </p></li>
</ol>

        <p>Before I started writing this blog, I used <a href="https://moinmo.in">MoinMoin</a> as a personal wiki.
It was self-hosted on a Linux box in my parents' basement. I used it for
everything: jotting down ideas, as a calendar, storing guitar tabs, tracking
workout routines, course planning, and personal finances. I wrote on the wiki
actively from about 2002 to about 2008. Here are some blasts from the past:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Lego fandom started to shift from into robotics. To be clear,
this is just a fancy way of saying that I was still <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/Bartender/">playing</a> <a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/CardDealer/">with</a>
<a href="http://wiki.z3.ca/VerticalCrossBeams/">legos</a> into my early twenties.</li>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">Lightning</a>, the static blog generator that powers this site, is
awesome for long form content. But it does not work well for short form content,
since creating each post requires a bunch of up-front effort:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I navigate to the right place, recalling the current year (!) and deciding on
the slug for the post (eg. <code>content/posts/2017/how-to-fix-the-world</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>I manually create the <code>index.md</code> file and then specify the redundant
human-readable title and the posted date within it:</p>

<pre><code>How to Fix the World
===
posted: May 28, 2017

Listen to me, I have the answers.
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>After writing the post, the title will inevitably have changed, so I rename the
slug to match: <code>mv how-to-fix-the-world how-to-slightly-improve-the-world</code>.
Finally I publish and tweet, and hopefully the world becomes infinitesimally
better.</p>

<p>I once tried to <a href="/easier-link-blogging/">make it easier to keep a lightning-style link blog</a>, but
ended up scrapping the solution because it was buggy and required a Mac.</p>

<h2>Split markdown pages</h2>

<p>My aim was to remove the up-front costs I described above. Appending to the top
of an existing file and having the engine automatically generate a slug based on
the title seemed like the right approach. This means that one markdown file
results in multiple HTML pages. The latest <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">Lightning</a> has been
updated with split markdown files, and refactored into classes, making it easier
to add features in the future. To give a sense of what these split markdown
files look like, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/borismus/smus.com/blob/master/notes_all.md">this file</a>.</p>

<p>Split markdown files power two new sections on this site: a [book
reviews section][books](/books), and a <a href="/notes">notes section</a>. I'm hoping that this
added convenience will encourage me to write shorter, more focused posts with
increasing frequency.</p>

    <title>Analogies from the industrial revolution</title>

        <p>Several centuries after the industrial revolution, machines still can't do all
physical things humans can, not even by a long shot. Drawing a masterwork,
singing an aria, playing a musical instrument, manipulating a soft object,
cutting hair, taking care of the sick are all examples of human-only tasks. The
industrial revolution gave machines the ability to do crude, physically
demanding work at scale, but it did not address all of physicality.</p>

<p>Just like the industrial revolution did not automate all aspects of physical
work, there is good reason to believe that the AI revolution will not solve
all aspects of intellectual work. Where the line will be drawn remains to be
seen, but I would bet that one aspect of human cognition that isn't really at
risk from any immediate AI-based disruption are creative pursuits. Many well
respected professions like doctor, lawyer, and engineer have both a rote
component that lends itself easily to automation, and a creative one. Some
examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Curing patients boils down to the application of known heuristics to
triage specific cases, but if you are a MD-PhD studying a new area of medicine
or tackling a new disease, it's a much more creative and speculative process. </p></li>
<li><p>The legal profession involves finding the right precedents relevant to the case
at hand, but articulating a convincing argument or deciding how to work out a
new situation where there are now laws yet? Creativity.</p></li>
<li><p>Designing a marketing webpage for a clothing brand is pretty formulaic. But
inventing way of solving a problem using new technology? Totally creative. </p></li>
</ul>
