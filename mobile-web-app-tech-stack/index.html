      <p>There are many technical decisions to make when writing web applications. I've
come back to writing modern web applications lately, and wanted to consolidate
some scattered thoughts that I’ve recorded over the course of my development
cycle. In particular, this post is about the set of frameworks that I found to
be instrumental in developing my most recent project. I'll go over some of the
most important framework types, each of which could be expanded into an article
in its own right. This is not meant to be an extensive comparison of existing
offerings, just a slice of technologies that I experimented with most recently.

<p>Although my focus is on mobile first, I think that this set of technologies can
be applied to web apps in general. All of my decisions and data points were
made with a few requirements in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript only (CoffeeScript, Dart, are definitely worth a serious look, but
cause an explosion in choice which I wanted to avoid)</li>
<li>Must work well in modern browsers (iOS 5, Android 4)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Picking an MVC</h2>

<p>The model view controller pattern has been in use in native UI app development
for decades. The basic idea is to separate the data layer (storage,
communication, data) from the presentation layer (UI, animation, input). There
are other similar patterns such as MVVM (Model View ViewModel), but the main idea
is to have well-defined separation between the presentation and data layers for
cleaner code and ultimately long-term velocity:</p>

<p><img src="separation.jpg" alt="separation" /></p>

<p>There are tons of offerings of JavaScript model view controller frameworks.
Some, such as <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://spinejs.com/">Spine.js</a> are written in pure
code, while others like <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> and <a href="http://angularjs.org/#/">Angular</a> rely on
DOM data attribute binding. Relying on HTML5 data DOM attributes feels wrong
for an MVC system, whose whole point is to separate view and data. This
excludes the Knockout and Angular frameworks. Spine.js is easier with
CoffeeScript, which we exclude based on my initial requirements.</p>

<p>Backbone.js has been around for longer than most (except perhaps JavaScriptMVC,
seems like a dead project), and also features a growing open source community.
For my app stack, I went with Backbone.js. For more information about picking
an MVC, check out <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">TodoMVC</a>, which implements the same Todo
application using different MVC frameworks. Also see this
<a href="http://codebrief.com/2012/01/the-top-10-javascript-mvc-frameworks-reviewed/">MVC framework comparison</a>, which strongly favors the
<a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, a relative newcomer to the scene. I haven’t yet had a chance
to play with it, but it’s on my list.</p>

<h2>Picking a templating engine</h2>

<p>To build a serious application on the web, you inevitably build up large DOM
trees. Rather than using JavaScript APIs to manipulate the DOM, it can be much
simpler and more efficient to write HTML using a string-based template instead.
Generally speaking JS templates have evolved to use this at-first strange
convention of embedding the template content inside script tags: <code>&lt;script
  id="my-template" type="text/my-template-language"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</code>. The basic
pattern of use for all template engines is to load the template as a string,
construct template parameters and then run the template and parameters through
the templating engine.</p>

<p>Backbone.js depends on <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore.js</a>, which ships with a somewhat
limited templating engine with verbose syntax. There are other options
available, including <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/">jQuery Templates</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.js</a>,
<a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache.js</a> and many others. jQuery Templates have been deprecated
by the jQuery team, so I did not consider this option. Mustache is a
cross-language templating system, featuring simplicity and a deliberate
decision to support as little logic as possible. Indeed, the most complex
construct in Mustache is a way to iterate an array of objects. Handlebars.js
builds heavily on Mustache, adding some nice features such as template
precompilation and in-template expressions. For my purposes I didn’t need these
extra features, and chose Mustache.js as my templating platform.</p>

<p>In general, my impression is that the existing templating frameworks are quite
minimal and comparable in features, so the decision is largely a matter of
personal preference.</p>

<h2>Picking a CSS Framework</h2>

<p>CSS frameworks are essential tools that extend CSS’s feature set with
conveniences such as variables, a way to create hierarchical CSS selectors, and
some more advanced features. This essentially creates a new language: an
augmented version of CSS (let’s call it CSS++). For development ease, some
frameworks implement a JavaScript CSS++ interpreter in the browser, while other
frameworks let you monitor a CSS++ file and compile it whenever there are any
changes made. All CSS frameworks should provide command line tool to compile
CSS++ down to CSS for deployment.</p>

<p>As with templating languages, there are many choices all of which do very
similar things. My choice was motivated by personal syntax preference, and I
prefer <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> because it avoids weird syntax like <code>@</code>. One drawback of SCSS is
that it doesn’t ship with a JavaScript interpreter (there is an <a href="https://github.com/bmavity/scss-js">unofficial one</a>
that I haven’t tried), but does come with a command line watcher. Other similar
CSS frameworks include <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> and <a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">Stylus</a>.</p>

<h2>How to layout views</h2>

<p>HTML5 provides a variety of ways to layout content, and MVC frameworks provide
no opinion about which of these layout technologies to use, leaving the
sometimes difficult decision to you, the developer.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, relative positioning is appropriate for documents, but
falls apart for apps. Absolute positioning should be avoided, as should tables,
clearly. Many web developers have turned to the float property to align
elements, but this is suboptimal for building application views, since it’s not
optimized for app-like layouts, which results in many odd problems and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8554043/what-actually-is-clearfix">infamous
clearfix hacks</a>.</p>

<p>After much experimentation with various web layout technologies over the years,
I think that a combination of fixed positioning and flexbox model is ideal for
mobile web applications. I use fixed positioning for UI elements that are fixed
on the screen (headers, sidebars, footers, etc). The flex box model is great
for laying out stacked views on the page (horizontally or vertically). It’s the
only CSS box model explicitly optimized for interface design, quite similar to
Android’s LinearLayout manager. For more information about the flexbox model,
read <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/flexbox/quick/">Paul's article</a> and note that this spec is being replaced by a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">new, non-backwards compatible version</a>.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Web Apps</h3>

<p>One final section on this matter: I’m a strong proponent of creating
device-specific user interfaces. This means re-writing parts of your view code
for different form factors. Luckily, the MVC pattern makes it relatively easy
to reuse a single model for multiple views (eg. tablet and phone).</p>

<p>Flipboard for iOS demonstrates this idea very well, giving tablet and phone
users a highly tailored experience for each device form factor.</p>

<p><img src="flipboard-phone.jpg" alt="flipboard-phone" />
The phone UI is optimized for vertical swipes, allowing single hand use.</p>

<p><img src="flipboard-tablet.jpg" alt="flipboard-tablet" />
Tablet UI works well for two hands holding the device on opposite sides.</p>

<h2>Input considerations</h2>

<p>On mobile, the main way users interact with your application is by touching the
screen with their fingers. This is quite different from mouse-based
interaction, since there are 9 additional points to track on the screen, which
means developers need to move away from mouse events when writing mobile apps.
In addition, mouse events on mobile have the problem of clicks being delayed by
300ms (there is a well-known <a href="http://code.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons.html">touch-based workaround</a>). For more information
about using these events in mobile browsers, see <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/touch.html">my touch events article</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not enough to just <code>s/mousedown/touchstart/</code> all of your event handlers.
There is a completely new set of gestures that users have come to expect on
touch devices, such as swipes to, for example, navigate through lists of
images. Though Apple has a little-known <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/UserExperience/Reference/GestureEventClassReference/GestureEvent/GestureEvent.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009353">gestures API</a>, there is no open spec for
doing gesture detection on the web. We really need a JavaScript library to do
gesture detection, for some of the <a href="http://www.lukew.com/touch/TouchGestureGuide.pdf">more common gestures</a>.</p>

<h2>How to make it work offline</h2>

<p>For an app to work offline, you need two things to be true:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assets are available (via AppCache, Filesystem API, etc)</li>
<li>Data is available (via LocalStorage, WebSQL, IndexedDB, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, building offline apps on the web is a difficult problem. Generally
speaking offline functionality should be built into your app from the
beginning. It’s especially difficult to offline-ify an existing web application
without significant code rewriting. Additionally, there are often unknown
storage limits for various offline technologies, and undefined behavior for
what happens when those limits are exceeded. Finally, there are problems with
technologies in the offline technology stack, most notably AppCache, as I
outlined in a <a href="http://smus.com/game-asset-loader">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>A very interesting approach to write truly offline-capable apps is to go
“offline first”. In other words, write everything as if you have no internet
connection, and implement a syncing layer that synchronizes data when an
internet connection exists. In the Backbone.js MVC model, this can fit nicely
as a custom <code>Backbone.sync</code> adapter.</p>

<h2>Unit testing</h2>

<p>It’s hard to unit test your UI. However, since you’re using an MVC, the model
is completely isolated from the UI and as a result, easy to test. <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit">QUnit</a> is
quite a nice option, especially because it allows to unit test asynchronous
code using it’s <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/start#decrement">start() and stop()</a> methods.</p>

<h2>Signing off</h2>

<p>To summarize, I used Backbone.js for MVC, Mustache.js for templating, SCSS for
a CSS framework, CSS Flexbox to render views, custom touch events and QUnit for
unit testing to write my mobile web application. For offline support, I’m still
experimenting with various technologies and will hopefully follow up with more
information a future post. While I strongly believe in the need for each class
of tool (eg. MVC) outlined here, I also believe that many of the specific
technologies I described here are interchangeable (eg. Handlebars and
Mustache).</p>

<p><strong>One more thing</strong>: yesterday (on January 17th, 2012), <a href="http://walmartlabs.github.com/thorax/">Thorax</a> was
announced. This is a Backbone-based set of libraries very similar in spirit to
what I describe in this post. I've yet to investigate it in any depth, but the
name is great :)</p>

<p>Use a similar set of frameworks? Have a personal favorite? Think I’m missing an
important type of framework? Let me know!</p>
