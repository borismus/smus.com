      <p>After spending a fair bit of time <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=iwork.com">monitoring twitter feeds</a>, I was
pleasantly surprised by the <a href="http://smokingapples.com/opinion/iworkcom-understanding-apples-online-office-extension/">world</a>'s <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/01/07/an_extensive_look_at_apples_new_iwork_com_service.html">response</a> to the recently
announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/iwork-dot-com/">iwork.com</a>. There were some <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/06/apple-announces-iwork-com-beta/">premature</a> <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/01/apple_sends_iwork_to_the_clouds_introduces_iworkcom.html">flames</a>, but
mostly as a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of iwork.com's
purpose. Someone even gave a <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/technical-details-behind-iworkcom/">technical breakdown</a> of the application,
which is especially endearing to me as an insider.</p>
