    <div class='body'>
      <p>There are hundreds of question answering sites on the Internet. Most of
them focus on specific topics (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> for software
engineering, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> for startups, etc). However, a number of
Q&amp;A sites exist for answering any kind of question, including the
contentious <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/flash/shmorky/babby.swf">"How is Babby formed?"</a>. Open domain Q&amp;A sites have a
distinct advantage over closed domain sites, since there is no need to
know which closed domain site is most appropriate for the question at
hand. Still, the asker needs to decide which open domain Q&amp;A site to ask
on! What follows is a self-referential approach to ranking popular open
domain Q&amp;A sites.</p>
<h2>Who questions the Q&amp;A sites?</h2>
<p>I compiled a list of the top 7 most popular Q&amp;A sites. Since
<a href="http://alexa.com">alexa.com</a> doesn't track subdomains (ex. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com">answers.yahoo.com</a>, and
<a href="http://askville.amazon.com">askville.amazon.com</a>), I was forced to use <a href="http://compete.com">compete.com</a>. I then
asked each popular site a "recursive" question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the best question answering site (besides $SITENAME), and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, most Q&amp;A sites responded with one or two answers, which I
harvested and analyzed. Clearly this sample is too small to draw any
scientifically valid conclusions, so my analysis is anecdotal at best.
Still it paints an interesting picture of the open domain Q&amp;A space. In
addition to the responses themselves, I looked at other data, such as
response time and response length. The following diagram summarizes the
results. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="qa-analysis.png" /> </p>
<p>The arrows in the above diagram represent
recommendations from one community to another. The surveyed Q&amp;A sites
are grouped based on popularity into three buckets. The most popular
bucket includes Yahoo! Answers and Answers.com, with 44 million and 31
million monthly uniques respectively. Despite having been around for the
longest (Answers.com launched in 1996), these are the most useless Q&amp;A
websites. It took 4 days to get the answer "Another good answering site
is answers.com" from a Y! Answers member, and no response ever came from
Answers.com in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>The moderately popular bucket of Q&amp;A sites
includes Answerbag, Mahalo Answers and AskVille. These sites get about 4
million uniques a month, and generally gave reasonable answers. Mahalo
answers yielded the longest response, a 120 word paragraph recommending
Aardvark. The least visited sites and relative newcomers to the scene
are the most promising and active communities. Aardvark's response speed
is unparalleled, the first answer taking just 17 minutes, probably due
to GTalk integration. While Quora didn't actually yield a Q&amp;A site
recommendation, the respondent produced an reasonable retort to my
rather questionable question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Q&amp;A "uber-site" that will do a good job being all things to all
people is simply not going to happen - it is like "one size fits all"
underwear, which never really fits anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Ranking</h2>
<p>Overall, here's my anecdotal list of top 7 open domain Q&amp;A sites (and
links to the questions I posted):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://vark.com/t/Tljh9Q">Aardvark</a> – Quick answers to your questions. Welcome to Aardvark!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-question-answering-site-besides-Quora-and-why">Quora</a> - Your question is flawed. Allow me to explain why.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mahalo.com/answers/what-is-the-best-question-answering-site-besides-mahalo-and-why">Mahalo</a> – I'll answer your question with quite a bit of detail,
    but it'll take a while.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.answerbag.com/a_view/9737054">Answerbag</a> - heres a decent answer but forget punctuation</li>
<li><a href="http://askville.amazon.com/question-answering-site-askville/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=74225856&amp;startIndex=1&amp;filter=ActivityOnQuestionsOnly">AskVille</a> - Takes forever to give you a really bizarre answer.</li>
<li><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlzEGEI5OLG69C1Ev0RgR4Pty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20101007131829AA8cjLR">Yahoo! Answers</a> – This community is brain damaged. Don't bother.</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_best_question_answering_site_besides_Answers_dot_com_and_why">Answers.com</a> – This community is inactive. Don't bother.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a lot more answers from the Q&amp;A communities, and some notion of
weight, you could imagine doing a PageRank-style calculation to
determine a more meaningful ordering of the top Q&amp;A sites. We leave the
details of that approach to the reader :) PS. Thanks Sean, Jenn and Pat!</p>
