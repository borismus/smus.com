  <meta name="description" content="Last week, a  sarcastic twitter reply  I posted two years ago was picked up by an account called Blue Check Watch, looking for verified twitter accounts disparaging white people. As a result, my account has become inundated by a hybrid human-bot army of white supremacist trolls. Most responses accused me of anti-white racism, completely missing what I thought was obviously a sarcastic tone. Sadly, many of the attacks are really nasty and ad-hominem. One user  posted  "Why do people who say this always look like this?", alongside my twitter profile photo. Others are  explicitly   anti-semitic  messages that do not bear repeating here. Ominously, I received an email from Twitter informing me that they have investigated  my tweet , flagged for violating their TOS and "have not taken any action at this time."   Writing my snarky tweet two years ago, I was a bit uncertain whether it was within the bounds of social acceptability. A white guy telling another white guy that white guys are "the worst", was intended to poke a bit of fun at the self-flaggelation associated with progressive politics. There is only so much self-censorship one can do while still remaining authentic. In a surprising twist, my tweet was offensive to a group I hadn't even thought about in a way I could not have predicted, two years after the fact.   Twitter lynchings are not new, but it's different when it happens to you. It has not had any serious consequences (yet?), and until it does, I will continue to view this as a funny story, and not something truly traumatic, as it is often framed in the press. Still, this experience serves as a good reminder of a few points:     Twitter's UI for threaded conversations is terrible, and hardly anyone of my    virtual lynch mob even bothered to look to the tweet I was responding to.   My tweet was five words, twenty four characters. It was meant to be pithy,    because that is how twitter works. But brief posts beget brief responses,    which is fine between friends, but not fine when the whole world is watching.   Relatedly, sarcasm is hard to convey in this situation. Only two responses    suggested that maybe I was being sarcastic, imploring my attackers, "Don't be    lazy."   The fact that tweets have no expiry date means anything you have ever posted    can be used against you in surprising ways. It took two years for my tweet to    be picked up. James Gunn's incriminating posts were ten years old. Social    norms change quickly, and this is one argument in favor of ephemerality.   On that same note, it seems that the white supremacy movement has really    embraced the internet over the last couple of years in some sick symbiosis    with the POTUS. At the same time, it's striking that the result of someone's    pathetic search for anti-white sentiment yielded such a lackluster example.   Despite a general willingness for my views to be challenged, I don't have    energy or desire to engage with this mob. I made no attempts to respond to    any of my attackers. They appear to be victims of confirmation bias, stupid    and/or malicious, and I have little faith that they will listen.   There are some really nasty people on the internet. If triggered, they will    sherlock your religion, your employer, your family, and try to hit you where    it hurts the most.     Lynchings aside, I've been trying to use twitter less in favor of consuming and producing longer form content, like books, blogs, and conversations. Given that my account is currently being inundated with anti-semitic spam, I have very little incentive to continue using the service. One thing that has been keeping me on the platform is the potential reach I can get through 6K followers. I should remember that in the grand scheme of things, this is a small number, 5 orders of magnitude less than the lovely POTUS. I shouldn't grow attached.   And so, just in time for my tenth twitter anniversary, it's time for me to make some changes. At the very least, I'll be taking a long break." />

      <p>Last week, a <a href="https://twitter.com/borismus/status/798350680951910400">sarcastic twitter
reply</a> I posted two
years ago was picked up by an account called Blue Check Watch, looking for
verified twitter accounts disparaging white people. As a result, my account has
become inundated by a hybrid human-bot army of white supremacist trolls. Most
responses accused me of anti-white racism, completely missing what I thought was
obviously a sarcastic tone. Sadly, many of the attacks are really nasty and
ad-hominem. One user
<a href="https://twitter.com/CascadianDennis/status/1033190496456269824">posted</a> "Why do
people who say this always look like this?", alongside my twitter profile photo.
Others are

<a href="https://twitter.com/NationDixie/status/1033395244014944256">anti-semitic</a>
messages that do not bear repeating here. Ominously, I received an email from
Twitter informing me that they have investigated <strong>my tweet</strong>, flagged for violating
their TOS and "have not taken any action at this time."</p>
<p>Writing my snarky tweet two years ago, I was a bit uncertain whether it was
within the bounds of social acceptability. A white guy telling another
white guy that white guys are "the worst", was intended to poke a bit of fun at
the self-flaggelation associated with progressive politics. There is only so
much self-censorship one can do while still remaining authentic. In a surprising

not had any serious consequences (yet?), and until it does, I will continue to
view this as a funny story, and not something truly traumatic, as it is often
