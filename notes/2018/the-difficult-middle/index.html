      <p>Monism gives life meaning through a single all-encompassing doctrine. Examples
include some political ideologies, religions, and <a href="https://meaningness.com/non-theistic-eternalism">variants of
rationality</a>. History has not been kind to those that have
fervently followed such doctrines. But once you see flaws in Monism, it can be
tempting to decide that life has <a href="https://meaningness.com/extreme-examples-eternalism-and-nihilism">no meaning at all</a>, falling
into the trap of Nihilism.</p>

<p>The choice between these two extremes is a false one. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/erGipespbbzdG5zYb/the-third-alternative">Rationalists know
this</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way">Buddhists know this</a>. Philosophers know
this too. David Chapman writes a <a href="https://meaningness.com/">whole blog</a> devoted to exploring
the space in between. But I have found <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html">Isaiah Berlin</a>'s synthesis to
be the most compelling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sobered by the 20th century’s failed utopias, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/berlin.html">Berlin</a>
argued for a more modest liberal pluralism that makes room for multiple,
genuinely conflicting goods. Family and work, solidarity and autonomy, tradition
and innovation are really valuable, and really in tension.  – <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now/554054/">Alison
Gopnik</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this view, we are condemned to an eternal balancing act, sometimes peering
too far into the meaningless abyss, and other times relaxing too deeply into
meaningful certainty. On balance, I hope to end up in this difficult middle.</p>
