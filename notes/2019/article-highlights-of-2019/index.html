<li>Unlike traditional two-by-four lumber, cross-laminated timber (CLT) consists of layers of wood glued together to form solid, thick panels that can be made in custom dimensions for anything from walls and floors to beams and roofs. CLT is being used to build mid-rise buildings, including big swaths of Google Sidewalk in Toronto. <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/skyscrapers-made-of-wood-make-a-return-nudged-by-google/1482316/">Skyscrapers made of wood make a return, nudged by google</a></li>

<li>A charitable look at Post-modernism holds that there is no privileged lens with which to view the world; that even empiricism is suspect, because it too has a tendency to reproduce and reify the power structures in which in exists. <a href="https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2019/04/03/post-modernism-and-political-diversity/">https://socratic-form-microscopy.com/2019/04/03/post-modernism-and-political-diversity/</a></li>

<li>Safe playgrounds lead to boredom, which tends toward rash stunts like turning somersaults on top of climbing frames and standing on the shoulders of others on the swings. So let’s make playgrounds a little more dangerous! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/well/family/adventure-playgrounds-junk-playgrounds.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/well/family/adventure-playgrounds-junk-playgrounds.html</a></li>

<li>We were certain that more communication would make everything better.

<li>What are signs that a player is alive? One strong sign is a player doing things outside of their domain. For example, Putin is a live player. The Russian state is doing things they haven’t done in a long time, like annexing Crimea… <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/live-versus-dead-players-2b24f6e9eae2">https://medium.com/@samo.burja/live-versus-dead-players-2b24f6e9eae2</a></li>
<li>San Francisco is a stunningly beautiful and continuously innovative city, cursed to always be considered one or two generations past its peak, like a rowboat chasing the horizon. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/San-Francisco-isn-t-what-it-used-to-be-13901994.php">https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/San-Francisco-isn-t-what-it-used-to-be-13901994.php</a></li>
<li>The hallmark of sociological storytelling is if it can encourage us to put ourselves in the place of any character.

<li>Bungalows in places like Wallingford and Ballard that many now find charming were widely criticized as cheap when they began popping up in the early part of the 20th century.

<li>The Baumol effect: “A violinist can always choose to stop playing violin, retrain for a while, and work in a factory instead. Maybe in 1826, when factory owners were earning $1.14/hour and violinists were earning $5/hour, so no violinists would quit and retrain. But by 2010, factory workers were earning $26.44/hour, so if violinists were still only earning $5 they might all quit and retrain.” <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/10/book-review-the-prices-are-too-dmn-high/">https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/10/book-review-the-prices-are-too-dmn-high/</a></li>

<li>Convenience is a value, and one we hold personally. Maybe it’s worth reconsidering this. <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-tyranny-of-convenience-2e7fa145ab4">https://onezero.medium.com/the-tyranny-of-convenience-2e7fa145ab4</a></li>
<li>We don’t want hectoring morality tales, as evidenced by The Odyssey’s exceeding popularity compared to Plato’s Republic. We want stories that let us be other characters: strong and cunning, defiant or afraid, good or bad or somewhere in between. <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2019/06/25/playstation-odysseys/">https://putanumonit.com/2019/06/25/playstation-odysseys/</a></li>

<li>We would like to think there is some quick hack, or that we can learn something with it feeling like a simple game, but the true is that real learning is hard work and frustrating. <a href="https://medium.com/@gjdickens/distraction-disguised-as-learning-duolingo-codeacademy-and-why-you-should-get-back-to-basics-99a22a9e2c33">https://medium.com/@gjdickens/distraction-disguised-as-learning-duolingo-codeacademy-and-why-you-should-get-back-to-basics-99a22a9e2c33</a></li>

<li>Because the 737 has kept the same name for 50 years, the FAA certification of the fourth-generation 737 in 2017 involved only light-touch approval. The only really rigorous test-result underpinnings were those of the 1967 machine. <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/timothy_taylor-polythetics-and-the-boeing-737-max">https://www.edge.org/conversation/timothy_taylor-polythetics-and-the-boeing-737-max</a></li>
<li>Criticize the existence of billionaires in general, their spending on yachts or mansions.

<li>“Isn’t school for learning math and science and reading,” he asked us one day, “not for teachers to tell us what to think about society?” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/when-the-culture-war-comes-for-the-kids/596668/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/when-the-culture-war-comes-for-the-kids/596668/</a></li>
<li>Study after study has shown open offices to foster seclusion more than innovation. People in an open office put on headphones, talk less, and feel terrible. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/wework-adam-neumann.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/wework-adam-neumann.html</a></li>
<li>Great summary of arguments in favor of and also against Sortition - the system whereby members of representative bodies are picked at random, like jurors.<a href="http://edmundgriffiths.com/sortition.html">http://edmundgriffiths.com/sortition.html</a></li>
<li>Rather than maintaining my own lawn, much better to have a smaller garden and live right beside a great park? <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/lawns-are-an-ecological-disaster-1826070720">https://earther.gizmodo.com/lawns-are-an-ecological-disaster-1826070720</a></li>
<li>We’re not merely lighting a match to the Amazon and imperiling everything that lives in it with extinction, but also summoning creatures long dead to return to Earth’s surface and give up the ancient energy they took to the grave. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/amazon-fire-earth-has-plenty-oxygen/596923/">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/amazon-fire-earth-has-plenty-oxygen/596923/</a></li>
<li>In the last 20 years, some Inuit communities who had never seen robins before have had to invent a name for them: “Koyapigaktoruk.” <a href="https://earthsky.org/earth/decoding-climate-change-signals-arctic-treeline-tundra-alaska">https://earthsky.org/earth/decoding-climate-change-signals-arctic-treeline-tundra-alaska</a></li>
<li>Yedoma consists of thick layers of soil packed around gigantic lodes of embedded ice. Because Yedoma contains so much ice, it can melt quickly — reshaping the landscape as sudden lakes form and hillsides collapse. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-siberia/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-siberia/</a></li>
<li>Wikis are just editable web pages; Twitter is just a way of sharing very short form writing; and Facebook is just a way of sharing writing and pictures with friends. Indeed, writing itself is just a clever way of ordering a small number of symbols on a page. While a medium may be simple, that doesn’t mean it’s not profound. <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">https://numinous.productions/ttft/</a></li>
<li>For middle-class and poor families, the picture is different. Federal income taxes have also declined modestly for these families, but they haven’t benefited much if at all from the decline in the corporate tax or estate tax. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html</a></li>
<li>The idea of the Anthropocene inflates our own importance by promising eternal geological life to our creations. It is of a thread with our species’ peculiar, self-styled exceptionalism. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/arrogance-anthropocene/595795/">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/arrogance-anthropocene/595795/</a></li>
<li>To Western ears, the combination of C and F# is grating, but Tsimane listeners rated this chord just as likeable as other chords that Westerners would interpret as more pleasant, such as C and G. <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/perception-of-musical-pitch-varies-across-cultures">https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/perception-of-musical-pitch-varies-across-cultures</a></li>
<li>It doesn’t seem too soon to ask: Is the vision of the VR or AR headset as a widespread consumer device just a dead branch hanging off technology’s evolutionary tree? <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90418190/the-one-thing-google-didnt-talk-about-at-its-keynote">https://www.fastcompany.com/90418190/the-one-thing-google-didnt-talk-about-at-its-keynote</a></li>

<li>Utrecht has a bike garage with sensors on the racks, making finding a free spot during rush hour much easier. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/world/europe/bicycling-utrecht-dutch-love-bikes-worlds-largest-bike-parking-garages.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/world/europe/bicycling-utrecht-dutch-love-bikes-worlds-largest-bike-parking-garages.html</a></li>
<li>By pushing a highly political agenda the Anxious, Social-Justice, Partisan (ASP) movement is undermining bipartisan efforts--and nothing important will be done unless both sides of the aisle are involved. <a href="https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-real-climate-debate.html">https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-real-climate-debate.html</a></li>
<li>The party launched the app, called Study the Great Nation, containing articles and videos about Xi’s activities or his ideology, “Xi Jinping Thought.” There is even a sense of competition, with users earning points for reading articles and commenting on them, and a leader board showing how users are faring in quizzes. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-app-on-xis-ideology-allows-data-access-to-100-million-users-phones-report-says/2019/10/11/2d53bbae-eb4d-11e9-bafb-da248f8d5734_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-app-on-xis-ideology-allows-data-access-to-100-million-users-phones-report-says/2019/10/11/2d53bbae-eb4d-11e9-bafb-da248f8d5734_story.html</a></li>
<li>Younger Palestinians were interested (in improving relations with Israel), but that there were none well-established enough in their careers yet to withstand the blowback. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/israel-arab-dialog.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/israel-arab-dialog.html</a></li>

<li>Terrifying: ISPs would recognize the obsolescence of the internet and support the Trinet only, driven by market demand for optimal user experience from GOOG-FB-AMZN. <a href="https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html">https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html</a></li>
<li>Saildrones are autonomous sailboats that act as mobile weather stations.

<li>Prediction is overrated. What we really should be striving for, with our social science, is ability to bring about desirable outcomes and to avoid unwanted outcomes. <a href="http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/psychohistory-and-cliodynamics/">http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/psychohistory-and-cliodynamics/</a></li>

<li>Great mathematicians each had their own strategies for generating ideas. Erdős sought hyper-focussed vigilance, Poincaré described lying in bed in a half-dream state as the ideal condition, Descartes famously loved to lounge in bed in the morning and think. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-myth-and-magic-of-generating-new-ideas?verso=true">https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-myth-and-magic-of-generating-new-ideas?verso=true</a></li>
<li>On the Estonian border, another anekdot goes, a border guard is filling out Putin’s entry form. “Occupation?” the officer asks. “Not today,” Putin replies. “Just tourism.” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/russian-jokes-tell-deeper-truths-about-putin-and-trump/602713/">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/russian-jokes-tell-deeper-truths-about-putin-and-trump/602713/</a></li>
<li>The Reigns mechanic requires making pragmatic choices to stay alive, not always being ideologically consistent, and working to find a way out over course of generations, slowly discovering one’s true nature and power. <a href="https://emshort.blog/2018/01/24/reigns-her-majesty/">https://emshort.blog/2018/01/24/reigns-her-majesty/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mkremins.github.io/blog/gardening-games/">In exploration games, to spend time in a place is to deplete it, to make it less and less interesting until there’s no longer any reason to stay. In gardening games, to spend time in a place is to enrich it.</a></li>
