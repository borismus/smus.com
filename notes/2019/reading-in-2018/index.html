<li>Between 1900 and 1910, Seattle’s population tripled, from just over 80,000 to
more than 230,000 people. <a href="http://archive.kuow.org/post/story-behind-seattles-obsession-craftsman-homes">The Story Behind Seattle's Obsession With Craftsman
Homes</a></li>
<li>The demo drew rave reviews from the technology press. <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/technology/the-daily/no-googles-pixel-buds-wont-change-the-world">No, Google’s Pixel Buds
won’t change the
world</a></li>
<li>That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone
you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.

<li>Our choice is not between "regulation" and "no regulation." The code
regulates. It implements values, or not. It enables freedoms, or disables
them. It protects privacy, or promotes monitoring. <a href="https://harvardmagazine.com/2000/01/code-is-law-html">Code Is
Law</a></li>
<li>In other words: AIs are best at choosing answers. Humans are best at choosing
questions. <a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-case">How To Become A
Centaur</a></li>
<li>Today’s belief in ineluctable certainty is the true innovation-killer of our
age. In this environment, the best an audacious manager can do is to develop
small improvements to existing systems — climbing the hill, as it were, toward
a local maximum, trimming fat, eking out the occasional tiny innovation — like
city planners painting bicycle lanes on the streets as a gesture toward
solving our energy problems. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/10/stephenson-innovation-starvation/">Innovation
Starvation</a></li>
<li>There is no reason to let a company make so much money while potentially
helping to radicalize billions of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html">YouTube, the Great
Radicalizer</a></li>
<li>Favoring the “soft” aspects of a college application is straightforwardly
beneficial to the more privileged at the expense of the less. <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/sat-class-race-inequality-college-admission">The Progressive
Case for the
SAT</a></li>
<li>Science fiction allows us the distance to circumvent issue fatigue in our very
troubled times. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08674-8">Science fiction when the future is
now</a></li>
<li>Isaiah Berlin, sobered by the 20th century’s failed utopias, has argued for a
more modest liberal pluralism that makes room for multiple, genuinely
conflicting goods. Family and work, solidarity and autonomy, tradition and
innovation are really valuable, and really in tension <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/steven-pinker-enlightenment-now/554054/">When Truth and Reason
Are No Longer
Enough</a></li>
<li>I am not a relativist; I do not say "I like my coffee with milk and you like
it without; I am in favor of kindness and you prefer concentration camps"

Pluralism</a></li>
<li>Unstructured, unsupervised time for play is one of the most important things
we have to give back to kids if we want them to be strong and happy and
resilient. <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2017/10/26/the-fragile-generation">The Fragile
Generation</a></li>
<li>The average net worth among adults in the 95th to 99th percentile is about
$1.7 million. Among the 0.1 percent, it’s about $60 million. Who, exactly, are
the aristocrats again? <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/05/forget-the-atlantics-9-9-percent-the-1-percent-are-still-the-problem.html">Forget What the Atlantic Is Telling You. The 1 Percent
Are Still the
Problem</a></li>
<li>We are a species that strives not just for survival, but also for
significance. We want lives that matter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/opinion/sunday/suicide-rate-existential-crisis.html">Is This an Existential
Crisis?</a></li>
<li>To support triangulation, we recommend a shift to a contributorship model,
similar to the credits that roll at the end of a film — a long list of
individuals with their contributions described fully and specifically <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01023-3">Robust
research needs many lines of
evidence</a></li>
<li>Do whatever you can’t stop thinking about. Documenting your findings in public
(regardless of outcomes!) is a worthy contribution to society, full stop. <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research">The
independent researcher</a></li>
<li>Various studies have identified cooperation as a core theme in popular
narratives across the world. ... nearly 80% of their tales concerned moral
decision making and social dilemmas <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180503-our-fiction-addiction-why-humans-need-stories">Our fiction addiction: Why humans need
stories</a></li>
<li>The transhumanist vision too easily reduces all of reality to data,
concluding that “humans are nothing but information-processing objects.”
<a href="https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1">Survival of the
Richest</a></li>
<li>This means that the mistake must be at the root, at the very basis of human
thinking in the past centuries. ... It could also be called
anthropocentricity, with man seen as the center of everything that exists. <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/alexandersolzhenitsynharvard.htm">A
World Split
Apart</a></li>
<li>Concoct one story where things get better, one where they get worse, and one
where they get weird. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/how-make-big-decision.html">How to Make a Big
Decision</a></li>
<li>Particularly sad is the belief that the majority of the homeless were drunks,
drug addicts, criminals or thieves. It is true that the category “homeless”
has come to include all of those people, but there are so many, many more who
are none of those things. <a href="https://crosscut.com/2018/09/why-i-started-giving-homeless">Why I started giving to the homeless</a></li>
<li>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Magic Leap is almost entirely built on the visions of
grown men wanting to immerse themselves in fantasy worlds. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-magic-leap-con-1829716266">The Magic Leap
Con</a></li>
<li>The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and
discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to
sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every
day. That is real freedom. The alternative is unconsciousness, the
default-setting, the "rat race"-the constant gnawing sense of having had and
lost some infinite thing. <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/">This is Water</a></li>
<li>The big mistake in this pattern of failure is projecting your subjective lack
of comprehension onto the object you are looking at, as “irrationality.” We
make this mistake because we are tempted by a desire for legibility. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">A Big Little Idea Called Legibility</a></li>
<li>There is something sinister and corrupt—Maoist—in the habit of assigning
people to categories. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-is-addicted-to-outrage-is-there-a-cure-1543620811">America Is Addicted to Outrage. Is There a
Cure?</a></li>
<li>Like the open office, the loud restaurant seems to have overstayed its
welcome. That’s because loud restaurants are more profitable. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/11/how-restaurants-got-so-loud/576715/">How Restaurants
Got So
Loud</a></li>
