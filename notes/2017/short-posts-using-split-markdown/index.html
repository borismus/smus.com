After writing the post, the title will inevitably have changed, so I rename the slug to match:  mv how-to-fix-the-world how-to-slightly-improve-the-world .

      <p><a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">Lightning</a>, the static blog generator that powers this site, is
awesome for long form content. But it does not work well for short form content,
since creating each post requires a bunch of up-front effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I navigate to the right place, recalling the current year (!) and deciding on
   the slug for the post (eg. <code>content/posts/2017/how-to-fix-the-world</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I manually create the <code>index.md</code> file and then specify the redundant
   human-readable title and the posted date within it:</p>
<pre><code>How to Fix the World

posted: May 28, 2017

Listen to me, I have the answers.

</ol>
<p>After writing the post, the title will inevitably have changed, so I rename the
slug to match: <code>mv how-to-fix-the-world how-to-slightly-improve-the-world</code>.
Finally I publish and tweet, and hopefully the world becomes infinitesimally
better.</p>

<h2>Split markdown pages</h2>
<p>My aim was to remove the up-front costs I described above. Appending to the top
of an existing file and having the engine automatically generate a slug based on
the title seemed like the right approach. This means that one markdown file
results in multiple HTML pages. The latest <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">Lightning</a> has been
updated with split markdown files, and refactored into classes, making it easier
to add features in the future. To give a sense of what these split markdown
files look like, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/borismus/smus.com/blob/master/notes_all.md">this file</a>.</p>
<p>Split markdown files power two new sections on this site: a [book
reviews section]<a href="/books">books</a>, and a <a href="/notes">notes section</a>. I'm hoping that this
added convenience will encourage me to write shorter, more focused posts with
increasing frequency.</p>
