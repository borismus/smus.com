  <meta name="description" content="I recently enjoyed a podcast about intelligence, aliens and learning where Kevin Kelly was interviewed by Sam Harris. Here are some things I liked about it:       Kelly makes a great argument that with text we already have no way of knowing   what is true. We have to rely on the source. My fears of audio and video fake   news are reduced.       It's obvious that the world is changing quickly, which means lifelong learning   is necessary. One thing I haven't systematically understood is how I learn   best. How would you even figure that out?       Chimpanzees are amazing at  short term spatial   memory , and do better than   humans in these cognitive tasks on average.       Currently, the best Chess players are human-computer hybrids. Harris claims   that computers alone will eventually be better than these hybrids, but    his claim that "the ape will just be adding noise" is unsubstantiated.       About mid-way, the two discuss the analogy between AI and aliens. I haven't   thought of this either. But I wondered how salient that analogy was given that we   have a largely shared environment with whatever AIs we create. To the extent   that the AIs truly are alien, I wonder how much of a unifying force these   alien AIs could be for humanity.        I strongly agreed with Kelly when he says that building machine systems   enhances our self-understanding. Building VR rendering and head tracking   systems, you benefit from some human visual perception basics. Human   psychology is critical for building user interfaces. You need an understanding   of how human hearing works to build good lossy audio compression.       An interesting thought experiment that superscedes Asimov's laws of robotics:   what if we built AGIs that were terribly worried about what people think. Then   we reduce the machine menace problem to merely the evils of humanity." />

      <p>I recently enjoyed a podcast about intelligence, aliens and learning where Kevin
Kelly was interviewed by Sam Harris. Here are some things I liked about it:</p>

  humans in these cognitive tasks on average.</p>
