        <p>One benefit of keeping a long term note garden is that you can have
conversations with your past self. You wake up a slightly different person every
morning. Aggregated over years and decades, you slowly become a very different
person. But if you've been taking notes, a crystallized past self is still
around!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your past self kinda sucked at note taking. He wrote too
verbosely. He was not familiar with note hygiene like putting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)">Bottom Line
Up Front</a>. Worst of all, he
picked the least descriptive note names, like "3D Automaton", "Geo Games", and
"Run". If he was still around, you would tell him to read <a href="/books/how-to-take-smart-notes/">How to Take Smart
Notes by Sonke Ahrens</a>, but your old self is
long gone.</p>

<p>What if we could summarize overlong, unstructured, poorly named notes
automatically, into terse but precisely descriptive golden nuggets?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Just think of the possibilities...</p>

<ul>
<li>We could auto-generate far better names for your old notes, or suggest names
for new ones.</li>
<li>We could remind you what a rambling note was really about, or suggest a BLUF
paragraph for notes that seem to be missing it.</li>
<li>Each note's summary could then be used in other automatic generation tasks!</li>
</ul>

<h1>So how can we summarize long notes automatically?</h1>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are built on Transformer, a neural
network architecture that Google Research invented and open-sourced in 2017.
These models are trained on huge amounts of data, hence "Large". They are
designed to be universal, capable of performing a variety of different tasks.
Given some input text, the LLM predicts what words should come next. This simple
input-output signature leads to surprisingly flexible results. </p>

<p>As of 2021, LLMs seem to produce more compelling text summaries than older
models specialized for this purpose.</p>

<h2>Constraints of LLMs</h2>

<p>Although input length limits increased substantially since GPT-2, <strong>input length
is still limited</strong> to 2048
<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them">tokens</a>,
which maps to roughly 8000 chars. Some of my notes are well beyond this limit,
so inputting a long note verbatim is not possible. </p>

<p>Even without the token limit constraint, there is a natural <strong>recency bias</strong>
towards the latter part in the input. The model continues the provided input
string, so the last words of the input are naturally weighted more heavily.</p>

<p>Also, LLMs are trained on giant amounts of text, mostly harvested from things
people write on the internet. On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog. Dogs
can be a little bit crass, or make up facts, so it's no surprise that GPT-3
often does the same.</p>

<h1>Summarization ¶ by ¶ by ¶</h1>

<p>One naive approach might be to take the whole note, its first few sentences, or
its first couple paragraphs, and feed this as input to the summarizer. Even if
the note fits within the GPT-3 token limit, we would end up indexing on
arbitrarily selected last sentences of the input.</p>

<p>To better sample the whole note, my approach is inspired by <a href="https://openai.com/blog/summarizing-books/">OpenAI's book
summarization</a>, and reminiscent of
techniques I used for <a href="https://smus.com/crowdforge/">CrowdForge</a>. I summarize a
note paragraph-by-paragraph, where each paragraph becomes a line in a new
"paragraph" I call the summary. If an even greater summarization is desired, the
resulting paragraph can itself be summarized. My summarization approach,
succinctly:</p>

<p><img src="/ai-note-garden-summarizer/summarization-para-by-para.png" alt="Summary of summaries, paragraph by paragraph" /></p>

<p><strong>GPT-3 and Markdown</strong>: Markdown's funny characters can safely be stripped
before summarizing. Seeing URLs in the input makes GPT-3 want to produce URLs
too. These URLs look legit and the domain is often a real website, but the path
is almost always hallucinated. To prevent GPT-3 from generating bizarre
punctuation and URLs to nowhere, I convert the markdown to plaintext, and strip
all links.</p>

<p><strong>Short paragraphs</strong>: Some paragraphs are short and don't need to be summarized.
Single sentences can be thrown into the intermediate summary directly.</p>

<h1>Zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, oh my!</h1>

<p><strong>Zero-shot</strong> is the simplest possible way to get GPT-3 to produce a summary of
input text. Here, we provide plaintext instructions requesting that a summary be
generated, with no examples of what sort of output we would like. Here's a
python f-String template that we can fill out and send to GPT-3:</p>

<pre><code>f'''Paragraph: 
{paragraph}
One sentence summary:'''
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Few-shot</strong> gives more control over the output. We can include a few examples
of expected results before providing the input paragraph: </p>

<pre><code>f'''Paragraph: 
{example_paragraph_1}
One sentence summary: {example_summary_1}
Paragraph: 
{example_paragraph_2}
One sentence summary: {example_summary_2}
Paragraph: 
{example_paragraph_3}
One sentence summary: {example_summary_3}
Paragraph:
{input_paragraph}
One sentence summary:'''
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Fine-tuning</strong> s the next level in optimizing output of the summarizer would be
to fine-tune the model with thousands of examples.</p>

<p>So far, I've found that few-shot and zero-shot paragraph summarization leads to
results that are on par in terms of their subjective quality. But prompt design
is not an exact science, and I'd expect better of an NLP expert (is that you?
please email me 😇).</p>

<p>Enough rambling. Show me the summaries, Lebowski!</p>

<p>Some things to highlight from the results above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some facts are completely made up, even with the original content to ground
GPT-3. The 1950s aren't mentioned anywhere in <code>Grandpa interview</code>.</li>
<li>Lists like <code>VR Ideas</code> and the Ursula Le Guin short story collection are
summarized in really unsatisfying ways.</li>
<li>GPT-3's synthesis between a diaper change, and too many wake-ups? "She's a
little shit." I sometimes feel that way too!</li>
<li><strong>Cherry picking</strong>: Some summaries overindex on one part of the note, and
ignore the rest. 
<ul>
<li>Overly focused on Solowheel in <code>LiPo Batteries and Wiring</code> even though I
only used it as an example of an EV using lithium iron phosphate battery
batteries.</li>
<li>Completely ignores the actual hormones in <code>List of human hormones</code>, and just
focuses on a small aside about the Culture novels. </li>
<li>Ignores the pedestal in <code>Parable of the Monkey on a Pedestal</code>, focusing on
just getting the monkey to read Shakespeare. Admittedly, this is the point
of the parable, but the result is not an adequate sumary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Too much variety</h1>

<p>Looking through some of these random notes and their generated summaries, I am
reminded of the wide variety of notes in my garden. Some are collections of
favorite poems, quotes, and words I like. Others include references to images
and tables. Book summaries, meeting notes, recipes, sometimes even fragments of
code are all found in my garden.</p>

<p>To produce better summaries in the future, I'd first classify what sort of note
we're dealing with, and then pick from a variety of different summarization
techniques. The current approach doesn't work well on lists. Fragments of code
don't need to be summarized at all.</p>

<p>So that's Summer, the note summarizer. She could use more work, but I'm going to
call it a day for now. I'll be back soon to introduce you to another AI-based
note gardener apprentice.</p>

<p>The above anecdata is certainly interesting. Some funny things to highlight:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some facts are completely made up, even with the original content to ground
GPT-3. Nowhere in <code>Grandpa interview</code> is 1950 mentioned, and the immigration
date is fully hallucinated.</li>
<li>Lists like <code>VR Ideas</code> and the Ursula Le Guin short story collection are
summarized in really unsatisfying ways.</li>
<li>Some summaries overindex on something GPT-3 finds especially interesting. I
mention Solowheel in <code>LiPo Batteries and Wiring</code> only as an example of an EV
using LiFePo batteries.</li>
<li>Semantic loss in summarization often occurs, especially with the two-stage
process. The sleep diary contained a note about pooping, and too many
wake-ups. The synthesis is pretty hilarious, but not my original intent.</li>
- 
</ul>

<h1>Too much variety</h1>

<p>Looking through some of these random notes and their generated summaries, I am
reminded of the wide variety of notes in my garden. Some are collections of
favorite poems, quotes, and words I like. Others include references to images
and tables. Book summaries, meeting notes, recipes, sometimes even fragments of
code are all found in my garden.</p>

<p>To produce better summaries in the future, I'd first classify what sort of note
we're dealing with, and then pick from a variety of different summarization
techniques. The current approach doesn't work well on lists. Fragments of code
don't need to be summarized at all.</p>

<p>So that's Summer, the note summarizer. She could use more work, but I'm going to
call it a day for now. I'll be back soon to introduce you to another AI-based
note gardener apprentice.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read Collapse of Complex Societies on GB' suggestion. This one was a doozie, and I must say, often over my head for its breadth of references into specific civilizations that I have no background with at all. And Tainter assumes you are either familiar with a broad variety of civilizations in detail, or will do the legwork to get there. As a result, I felt that this book was better suited to an Anthropology/Archaeology professional.</p>

<p>Tainter strives toward a general pattern of collapse, one that applies to all collapses at all times. Very simplified, it goes like this. A civilization grows, becomes more complex, and then crumbles under its own success. Succinctly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of civilisation as a poorly-built ladder. As you climb, each step that you used falls away. A fall from a height of just a few rungs is fine. Yet the higher you climb, the larger the fall. Eventually, once you reach a sufficient height, any drop from the ladder is fatal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-are-we-on-the-road-to-civilisation-collapse</p>

<h1>Tainter's general theory</h1>

<p>In Tainter's words, four concepts lead to understanding collapse, the first three of which are the underpinnings of the fourth. These are:</p>

<ol>
<li>human societies are problem-solving organizations</li>
<li>sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance</li>
<li>increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita, and</li>
<li>investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response often reaches a point of <strong>negative</strong> marginal returns.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, while initial investment by a society in growing complexity may be a rational solution to perceived needs, that happy state of affairs cannot last. As the least costly extractive, economic, information-processing, and organizational solutions are progressively exhausted, any further need for increased complexity must be met by more costly responses.</p>

<p>Once a complex society enters the stage of declining marginal returns, collapse becomes a mathematical likelihood, requiring only time.</p>

<p>The following diagram is illuminating:</p>

<p>!<em>Tainter's diminishing marginal returns in complex societies.png</em></p>

<p>I am immediately reminded of <em>Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization</em>, but Tainter's argument is even more macro. The whole of society reaches the second watershed, and then sets itself on track for general collapse. </p>

<h1>Civilization = complexity</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The features that popularly define a civilized society - such as great traditions of art and writing - are epiphenomena or covariables of social, political, and economic complexity. Complexity calls these traditions into being, for such art and literature serve social and economic purposes and classes that exist only in complex settings. Civilization emerges with complexity, exists because of it, and disappears when complexity does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, Tainter argues, rising and falling complexity is a monitor for the phenomenon termed civilization.</p>

<h1>States are complex, chiefdoms are simple</h1>

<p>Tainter distinguishes between complex and simple societies. Most societies are complex, and governed by states. Robert Carneiro has estimated that 99.8 percent of human history has been dominated by states.</p>

<p>In contrast, simple societies, governed by chiefdoms are limited by the obligations of kinship and the lack of true coercive force. By the time human organizations emerged that today would be called a state, these limitations had been surpassed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The features that set states apart ... are: territorial organization, differentiation by class and occupation rather than by kinship, monopoly of force, authority to mobilize resources and personnel, and legal jurisdiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tainter sees states as a series of complex systems. Very much along the lines of <em>Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complex societies tend to be what Simon has called "nearly decomposable systems". That is, they are at least partly built up of social units that are themselves potentially stable and independent, and indeed at one time may have been so.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>How are states formed? Conflict vs. integration theory</h1>

<p>Tainter fairly accuses the reader of being obsessed by collapse, and insufficiently interested in formation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It cannot be wholly resisted, for collapse may not be understood except in the context of how complex societies function and operate, and that cannot he divorced from the question of how they have come into being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Conflict theory</strong> can be traced to Ibn Khaldun (1377). In essence, conflict theory asserts that the state emerged out of the needs and desires of individuals and subgroups of a society. The state, in this view, is based on divided interests, on domination and exploitation, on coercion, and is primarily a stage for power struggles (Lenski 1966: 16-17). More specifically, the governing institutions of the state were developed as coercive mechanisms to resolve intra- societal conflicts arising out of economic stratification (Fried 1967; Haas 1982: 20). The state serves, thus, to maintain the privileged position of a ruling class that is largely based on the exploitation and economic degradation of the masses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conflict theory suffers from a problem of psychological reductionism. That is, the emergence of the state is explained by reference to the wishes, intentions, needs, and/or desires of a small, privileged segment of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Integration theory</strong> suggests that complexity, stratification, and the state arose, not out of the ambitions of individuals or subgroups, but out of the needs of society. The major elements of this approach are: (a) shared, rather than divided, social interests; (b) common advantages instead of dominance and exploitation; (c) consensus, not coercion; and (d) societies as integrated systems rather than as stages for power struggles (Lenski 1966: 15-17). The governing institutions of the state developed to centralize, coordinate, and direct the disparate parts of complex societies.</p>

<p>Integration theory resonates with me. Specifically this framing as stratification as a necessary evil:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The costs of stratification are a necessary evil which must be borne to realize its integrative benefits. In basing the development of complexity on real, observable, physical needs (defense, public works, resource sharing, etc).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also does not preclude that compensation of elites does not always match their contribution to society.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is, however, a very important point that conflict and integration theory have in common. In both views, states are problem-solving organizations. Both theories see the state as arising out of changed circumstances,</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Types of collapse</h1>

<p><strong>Partial imperial collapse is common</strong> Tainter identifies a pattern in which an empire doesn't fully collapse, merely loses its colonies and reverts to being a standalone country:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other cases that could be added to this list are the collapses of modern empires (such as the Spanish, French, and British). The demise of these empires clearly represents a retrenchment from a multi-national level of centralized organization that was global in extent. There are, however, differences from the majority of cases just discussed. Most notable is the fact that the loss of empire did not correspondingly entail collapse of the home administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Full imperial collapse is also possible</strong> Tainter describes the terrifying disintegration of Ottoman Turkish authority in 1918:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the Allied troops... found a city that was dead. The Turkish government had just ceased to function. The electrical supply had failed and was intermittent. Tramways did not work and abandoned trams littered the roads. There was no railway service, no street cleaning and a police force which had largely become bandit, living on blackmail from citizens in lieu of pay. Corpses lay at street corners and in side lanes, dead horses were everywhere, with no organization to remove them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Institutional collapse</strong> Each civilization may typically contain a number of individual political entities that themselves rise and fall. However the definition of "civilization" tends to be vague and intuitive. </p>

<p><strong>Cultural continuity</strong> Even if a civilization collapses, the culture tends to continuity.</p>

<h1>A catalog of other causes of collapse</h1>

<p>Tainter is skeptical about many commonly provided reasons for collapse:</p>

<ol>
<li>Depletion of vital resource</li>
<li>Establishment of a new resource base</li>
<li>Catastrophe</li>
<li>Insufficient response to circumstances</li>
<li>Other complex societies</li>
<li>Intruders</li>
<li>Class conflict, elite misbehavior</li>
<li>Social dysfunction</li>
<li>Mystical factors</li>
<li>Chance events</li>
<li>Economic factors </li>
</ol>

<p>None of these factors help understand collapse as a general phenomenon, applicable to all societies.</p>

<p>Tainter has general critiques of his predecessors: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rarely do authors question the logic of the climate proposition: How does or how can climatic fluctuations, invaders, and so forth lead to collapse? Can the postulated cause really account for the outcome? Is the explanation adequate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Resource depletion</strong>: If a society cannot deal with resource depletion (which all societies are to some degree designed to do) then the truly interesting questions revolve around the society, not the resource. What structural, political, ideological, or economic factors in a society prevented an appropriate response?</p>

<p><strong>Elite misbehavior</strong>: To suggest that societies collapse because elites act unwisely explains little. Are there conditions under which elites act wisely or unwisely, or is this a random variable? Is it even a definable and measurable factor?</p>

<h1>Mechanisms for collapse</h1>

<p>Specialization =&gt; Reduction of resiliency</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy of local systems are reduced as specialization increases. As special-purpose subsystems become increasingly differentiated, stability declines. Disruptions occurring anywhere will be spread everywhere, whereas in less complex settings a society would be cushioned against disruptions by less specialization, less interlinkage among parts, and greater time delays between cause and ultimate outcome. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elman Service's <em>Law of evolutionary potential</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more specialized and adapted a form in a given evolutionary stage, the smaller its potential for passing to the next stage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rhymes quite a bit with <em>The Great Filter solution to Fermi's paradox</em>. Service also writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Successful complex societies become locked into their adaptations, and are easily bypassed by those less specialized. So by having greater flexibility, less complex border states gain an increasing competitive advantage, and are thus able ultimately to topple older, established states</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another way of stating the same thing is the <strong>Dinosaur Model</strong>. Here, a complex society is seen as a lumbering colossus, fixed in its morphology, and incapable of rapid change. Locked into an evolutionary dead end, it represents an investment in structure, size, and complexity that is awesome and admirable, yet highly maladaptive. When stresses arise, such a society cannot adapt, and so must expire.</p>

<p>This rhymes very much with <em>Disruption theory</em> in business. This lock-in phenomenon can also be framed as a feedback loop: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other scholars implicate a positive feedback loop in collapse, from which escape is impossible. Colin Renfrew (1979) argues that under stress complex societies lack the option to diversify, to become less specialized. By doing more of what may have caused the problem in the first place, the breakdown of the system is made inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Runaway Train</strong> model may be a variant of the Dinosaur model, but it has its own distinct characteristics. A complex society is seen as impelled along a path of increasing complexity, unable to switch directions, regress, or remain static. When obstacles impinge, it can continue in only the direction it is headed, so that catastrophe ultimately results.</p>

<p>The <strong>House of Cards</strong> model differs from the previous two. It suggests that complex societies, either as a rule or in certain kinds of environments, are inherently fragile, operating on low margins of reserve, so that their collapse is inevitable.</p>

<p>The argument of these laws and models is that all societies, complex or otherwise, run the risk of adapting so well to existing circumstances that change becomes impossible.</p>

<h1>Complexity reduction =&gt; depopulation</h1>

<p>For Tainter, complexity reduction causes depopulation and not vice-versa. <em>Depopulation is often correlated with decline</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A complex society that has collapsed is suddenly smaller, simpler, less stratified, and less socially differentiated. Specialization decreases and there is less centralized control. The flow of information drops, people trade and interact less, and there is overall lower coordination among individuals and groups. Economic activity drops to a commensurate level, while the arts and literature experience such a quantitative decline that a dark age often ensues. Population levels tend to drop, and for those who are left the known world shrinks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>High upkeep of complex societies</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity and stratification are oddities when viewed from the full perspective of our history, and where present, must be constantly reinforced. Leaders, parties, and governments need constantly to establish and maintain legitimacy. This effort must have a genuine material basis, which means that some level of responsiveness to a support population is necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Civilization itself (i.e., great complexity), to Rappaport, may be maladaptive: Civilisation has emerged only recently - in the past six thousand or so years - and it may yet prove to be an unsuccessful experiment' (Rappaport 1977: 65).</p>

<h1>Misc</h1>

<p>The Ik People are really fascinating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Children are minimally cared for by their mothers until age three, and then are put out to fend for themselves. This separation is absolute. By age three they are expected to find their own food and shelter, and those that survive do provide for themselves. Children band into age-sets for protection, since adults will </p>

    <title>Understanding How We Learn: A Visual Guide</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read this book because it was recommended by C for work. This book serves as a nice visual summary of what we know about learning from a cognitive science perspective. The authors lament the large gap between what we know from this field and how educators do their job in practice.</p>

<h1>Educational myths</h1>

<p>Educational practices rely too much on intuition, and not enough on science. The authors make an analogy to medicine, and a scientific approach improved health outcomes dramatically around the turn of the 20th century. For examples, students read textbooks and notes repeatedly because it feels good, but this does not improve their learning outcomes. </p>

<p>Cognitive psychology can immediately debunk many myths in education:</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals DON’T learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style (e.g., auditory, visual, kinesthetic) <em>Learning styles are a stubborn myth</em></li>
<li>Environments that are rich in stimuli DON’T improve the brains of pre-school children.</li>
<li>Short bouts of coordination exercises DO NOT improve integration of left and right hemisphere brain function.</li>
<li>Exercises that rehearse coordination of motor-perception skills CAN’T improve literacy skills.</li>
<li>Differences in hemispheric dominance (left brain, right brain) DO NOT help explain individual differences among learners.</li>
<li>It has NOT been scientifically proven that fatty acid supplements (omega-3 and omega-6) have a positive effect on academic achievement</li>
<li>Emotional brain processes DO NOT interrupt those brain processes involved with reasoning</li>
<li>We DO NOT only use 10% of our brain</li>
<li>Memory is NOT stored in the brain much like as in a computer: each memory goes into a tiny piece of the brain</li>
<li>Children are NOT less attentive after consuming sugary drinks and/or snacks</li>
</ol>

<p>Good start. But it's hard to learn from a bunch of negation. The meat of the book is covered by first introducing human cognitive processes, which serve as an underpinning for everything. Then, the real gems are in the following section, which articulates  strategies for effective learning which were generated from theory, have been verified in the lab, and sometimes even in the classroom.</p>

<h1>Part 2: Summary of human cognitive processes</h1>

<h2>Sensation and perception</h2>

<p><strong>Sensation</strong> the output of sense organs. This will vary depending on your senses, but is generally objective</p>

<p><strong>Perception</strong> your interpretation of the sensations. This is generally very subjective, and depends on the context and the person</p>

<p>One way in which perception is subjective is illustrated by <em>Intensity of stimulus is proportional to the pre-existing stimulus, and logarithmic (Weber-Fechner law)</em>, which says that what you perceive is highly dependent on what you were just perceiving. This is true for both time and space.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom-up vs top-down processing</strong>: bottom-up processing focuses on the stimulus only, without bringing prior knowledge to make sense of it. This is similar to just sensing? Top-down processing involves using prior knowledge. For example, you hear a fire alarm, but know it was part of the fire drill, so remain calm (top-down). A baby, however, gets upset and cries (bottom-up).</p>

<p><strong>Curse of knowledge</strong> refers to the problem that a teacher may know a lot more than the student, and lack the empathy to decide how to properly explain something so that the student understands. Reminds me of https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/</p>

<h2>Attention and cognitive load</h2>

<p>Attention is a limited capacity resource. If you work on a difficult task, all of your attention is required. A simple task will leave you with some left over attention. <strong>Cognitive load</strong> is a measure of how much of someone’s attention will be required to grok an explanation. The goal, then, is to minimize cognitive load but still convey the concept.</p>

<p>Attention involves focusing on one thing at a time. <strong>Multi-tasking</strong> for humans is similar to multi-tasking for machines: you end up duty-cycling from one “simultaneous” activity to the next. And this causes both activities to be done worse than if they were done sequentially. Nice demonstration: </p>

<ol>
<li>Count aloud 1-26</li>
<li>Recite letters A-Z</li>
<li>Combine (1) and (2), reciting 1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, etc</li>
</ol>

<p>Empirically, it takes longer to do (3) than to do (1) + (2).</p>

<p>Attention can be focused towards the salient. For example, it’s easy to look around and quickly spot all objects that are red at will. In education, <strong>saliency</strong> comes from the students motivation, interest levels, the way the material is presented. This is very related to the <em>Krashen - Comprehensible and Interesting Input</em> approach.</p>

<p>Attention can also be lost, and this is known as <strong>mind wandering</strong>. This happens more during easy tasks, but also during very difficult tasks. This is one of the benefits of being in the <em>Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</em>.</p>

<p>In the chunking example, where the authors provide the characters of CHAPTER6ATTENTION scrambled in random order, I am finding that I can remember it better with a mnemonic. I guess this is sort of the point of chunking: it’s a way for more information to be stored in short-term memory, by relying on “chunks” that are already in exiting memory.</p>

<p>Why does attention vary between people? Three theories, but no consensus:</p>

<ol>
<li>Differences in working memory capacity</li>
<li>Differences in processing speed</li>
<li>Differences in attentional control (uh, seems tautological)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Working memory</h2>

<p>Working memory is modeled by a few components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The phonological loop</strong>: stores and rehearses auditory and language information. I came across this recently noticing how much easier it is to remember OTP codes if I speak them out loud. The phonological loop need not rely on audible speech, subvocalizing works too (but maybe less effectively? Look into this)</li>
<li><strong>The visuospatial sketch pad</strong> helps store visual information, such as creating mental maps of how to go from the bedroom to the kitchen. It’s the machinery that lets you manipulate an object in your head.</li>
<li><strong>The central executive</strong> is not well defined in the book, presented as everything not in the two categories above.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Memory is needed to do almost everything</strong>, from remembering names, to remembering how to do something, to doing basic things like comprehending speech, to having a coherent sense of self.</p>

<p><strong>Memory is reconstructive</strong> Recalling things is not a pure lookup as in a library or a computer. Memory is reconstructive, which means that every time you retrieve it, you are actually changing it. This means that memory is not objective, Many memories we have of things never happened, or happened very differently. Memories can also be changed by others.</p>

<p><strong>Short term memory only last 15-30 seconds</strong>. Psych experiments can easily be run where you administer a quiz to people in that time range to see short term memory performance, and longer to see long term memory performance. Subjects with long term memory loss do very poorly at 30s+ time intervals compared to those with normally functioning memory. (Example: H.M.)</p>

<h2>Memory representations in the brain</h2>

<p>Memories are <strong>encoded</strong> in the brain by groups of nerve cells (neurons) which are connected to one another via connections (synapses). When active neurons in a certain group are simultaneously active (engram), we are able to recall a concept. These engrams can be connected to one another (by synapses) by neuronal pathways.</p>

<p>When we learn, new groups of neurons activate in response to the incoming information. Ideally, these just active neurons undergo <strong>consolidation</strong>. Connections to other engrams are strengthened to create a long lasting engram. Ideal conditions involve sufficient rest and sleep.</p>

<p>Consolidated memories become <strong>stored</strong> as long-term memories, which makes them available for <strong>retrieval</strong>. But consolidation is not a one-time event. Every time a memory is retrieved, it is subject to reconsolidation.</p>

<p>This memory model helps motivate some pedagogic approaches: spaced practice, creating meaningful connections to existing knowledge, retrieving prior knowledge.</p>

<p>As soon as you encode something, you immediately start to forget it. Forgetting curves show an exponential drop off in retrieval performance over time. But forgetting is not a binary. Retrieval can be greatly helped for example by providing retrieval cues, which greatly increase performance.</p>

<h1>Part 3: Strategies for effective learning</h1>

<p>Studies on brain-training games suggest that performance on the games does not transfer to real-life tasks. </p>

<p>Each of the following section introduces a study technique that has been shown to work through studies. Many of them overlap one another.</p>

<h2>Spaced repetition: spread study activities out over time</h2>

<p>Ebbinghaus (1885) first showed that spacing repetition over time rather than massing them together (ie. cramming) led to better results long-term. This is replicated widely in RCTs in many contexts, seems like a pretty fundamental piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>There is a well defined answer to the question “when should I be studying given that the test is on $DATE”. But how does this best work when there is no test, and the goal is just indefinite retention. Is this even a good goal? Surely there are benefits to forgetting things.</p>

<p><em>Forgetting curves show how quickly information is naturally forgotten</em></p>

<h2>Interleaving: switch between topics while studying</h2>

<p>Focus on the same topic during a study session will improve results in the short term. But long term studies show that results are dramatically better in the interleaved case. </p>

<p>Which concepts should be interleaved? Studies show that interleaving completely unrelated concepts (eg. Science concepts and foreign language vocab) doesn’t lead to especially good outcomes. Also unclear what the effect is on attention. Is it bad like multi-tasking, or good because it reduces boredom?</p>

<p>Overall, a spaced repetition practice often includes interleaving naturally. But the authors acknowledge that establishing a spaced repetition practice is tricky. I think it’s even trickier for non-school settings.</p>

<h2>Elaborative interrogation: ask and explain how and why things work</h2>

<p>Elaborative interrogation (EI) is a specific method of elaboration where you ask yourself questions of how and why things work, then produce answers. </p>

<p>Cousins include <em>Socratic dialogue</em> and the chain of why questions that toddlers and young children are famous for.</p>

<p>A study (Woloshyn and Stockley) found that EI led to better long term retention than re-reading the material. It worked in both an individual condition (self-asking and answering) and in pairs (one asks, the other answers, WLOG). </p>

<p>Performance was even better if an adequate answer to the question was produced by the student. But only works if background knowledge high enough. Otherwise better to read for understanding. Caveat</p>

<h2>Concrete examples: illustrate abstract concepts with specific examples</h2>

<p>It helps to ground an abstract idea by giving concrete examples that tie back to the concept. For example, the notion of scarcity can be described abstractly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract: the rarer something is, the higher it’s value</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But seeing this for the first time may be hard to internalize, so providing a variety of examples is worthwhile:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Concrete: if you buy an airplane ticket 4 months in advance, there are many open seats on the plane and the price is low. If you buy last minute there are fewer (scarcity), and so their value is higher and the ticket costs more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even better is to provide multiple examples, from different domains. Given the above example, one about buying sports tickets would not be illuminating. But an example around water scarcity during a drought might be worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Dual coding: combine words with visuals</h2>

<p>Pictures are often remembered better than words, so the idea is to combine words and pictures to enhance learning. These can be diagrams, infographics, cartoon strips, etc. Presumably the same would apply to other mediums like video.</p>

<p>Combining modalities is helpful for all learners, not just those that like pictures or think of themselves as “visual learners”. Also, <em>Learning styles are a stubborn myth</em>.</p>

<p>One pitfall is to include visuals that are distracting because they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Too far from the content being studied, or</li>
<li>Too much information, causing cognitive overload</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal is clear and simple diagrams related to the target text.</p>

<h2>Retrieval practice: bring learned information to mind from long-term memory</h2>

<p>Retrieval involves reconstructing something you’ve learned in the past, <strong>from memory</strong>, and thinking about it right now. The key part is that retrieval is done from memory, as opposed to having the reference material in front of you. (Abbott, 1909)</p>

<p>Direct benefit: retrieval practice is highly effective for long-lasting durable learning. This practice has been consistently shown to be more effective than repeated reading. It improves not just the memory’s durability, but also flexibility, helping make more far-reaching inferences. (Roedigger and Karpicke 2006)</p>

<p>Indirect benefit: students and teachers get feedback about what they know and don’t know. A computer system can track what students do and do not know.</p>

<p>Because memory is reconstructive, accessing it repeatedly might send signals to the brain that this bit is important. But a lot of the underlying principles of why retrieval practice works aren’t known yet.</p>

<p>Many possible forms of retrieval practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write everything they know on a blank sheet</li>
<li>Create concept maps from memory</li>
<li>Draw a diagram from memory</li>
<li>Explain what they can remember to another person</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Need to be ZPD</strong>: If a retrieval task is too hard, students will be discouraged. If it’s too easy, they will be bored. Need to be in the <em>Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</em>, while retaining <em>Desirable difficulties</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Failed retrieval can still help</strong>: there is evidence that even a failed retrieval attempt can improve learning.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback &gt; no feedback</strong>: Authors discourage letting students self-grade. You can address their misunderstandings directly if you have an idea of what they got wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Delayed feedback?</strong>: Giving some feedback is better than giving none. But supposing we can give feedback, there’s also the question of when to best present it. But then there’s the danger of thinking they answered correctly when they were in fact incorrect.</p>

<h2>Strategy: frequent, low-stakes quizzes</h2>

<p>In addition to measuring performance, tests are also retrieval practice. But high pressure tests decrease learning benefits.</p>

<p>Both short-form answer and multiple choice quizzes have been shown to be effective. Short form answers are slightly better for retrieval, but not significantly (Smith and Karpicke, 2014). Multiple choice questions require a bunch of reasonable distractors to be effective.</p>

<h2>Scaffolding: retrieval practice should be modified for some learners</h2>

<p>Interesting if not directly related: this doesn’t work well on 4th graders, because the task of writing out everything they know on a blank sheet of paper is daunting. Young learners have a very low (9%) recall rate after reading a passage. </p>

<p>Solution might be to help them review the material first, which is called scaffolding. One example is to give a partially completed concept map based on the passage, then have the student fill out the rest, then do the recall. This has been shown to be very effective.</p>

<p>Look into this idea of “guided notes” for a subject. Take notes on a worksheet with cues and blank spaces, so that you are forced to take notes about specific concepts covered in class. (Konrad, Joseph &amp; Eveleigh, 2009)</p>

<h1>Establishing a spaced repetition practice is hard</h1>

<p>Again that damned study about how taking notes by hand is a better way to retain memory than by computer. (Muller &amp; Oppenheimer 2014)</p>

<p>Spacing practice is hard to get into. Authors suggest getting students to do personalized scheduling so that they can squeeze spaced retrieval sessions in on a daily basis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Spacing: find a regular time to review</li>
<li>Elaborative interrogation: ask questions about how and why things work</li>
<li>Concrete examples: think about turning ideas into concrete examples</li>
<li>Visuals: combine visuals and words</li>
<li>Retrieval practice: bring information to mind independent of any crutch</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to apply these strategies in AI-assisted learning</h1>

<p><strong>Elaborative interrogation</strong>: I wonder if it would help to let learners take one of the sides and the AI takes the other? Here's how it might work: </p>

<ol>
<li>Given a topic, generate some comprehension questions and have the learner answer. </li>
<li>Given a topic, have the learner come up with comprehension questions themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Concrete examples</strong>: Can LLMs generate concrete examples of abstract concepts?</p>

<p><strong>Quiz short answer grading</strong>: Can LLMs be used to grade short answer questions for how well they match the model answer? Anki and Orbit don't do this at all.</p>

<p><strong>Quiz multiple choice distractors</strong>: Can LLMs be used to generate reasonable distractors?</p>

<p><strong>Scaffolding: concept maps</strong>: Can LLMs be used to provide scaffolding? Perhaps a concept map can be intelligently blanked depending on skill level?</p>

<p><strong>Scaffolding: guided notes</strong>: Can LLMs intelligently generate a cloze reading activity?</p>

    <title>The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>It's been years since I would have said that I aspire to be a rationalist. But I've been swimming in rationality circles for long enough that some of the arguments and ideas in the book are somewhat trite. But I have enjoyed Julia’s podcast for her crispness of thought, ability to popularize, and pleasant voice. I'd recommend this book for someone unfamiliar with modern rationalism that's looking to get their feet wet. It's definitely a more coherent and less overwhelming starting point than lesswrong.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to the takedown of <em>Gerd Gigerenzer on Gut Feelings</em>, who’s ideas I am sympathetic to. </p>

<p><strong>Soldier mindset</strong> we tend to defend our beliefs against any evidence or arguments that might threaten them. Reasoning in the English language is often described through militaristic metaphors. We try to “shore up” our beliefs, “support them” and “buttress them” as if they’re fortresses. We try to “shoot down” opposing arguments and we try to “poke holes” in the other side.</p>

<p><strong>Scout mindset</strong> The scout’s job is not to attack or defend; it’s to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. Above all, the scout wants to know what’s really out there as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>Julia argues that scout mindset is always better than soldier mindset. There are some parallels to hedgehogs (Soldiers) and foxes (Scouts) too, as in <em>The Hedgehog and the Fox by Isaiah Berlin</em>. There are also echoes of System 1 (Soldier) and System 2 (Scout) ideas from <em>Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman and Tversky</em>.</p>

<h1>Rational irrationality</h1>

<p>Sometimes it's rational to be irrational. For example, you your outcomes as a start-up founder might be better if you have irrational belief in yourself (IS). This can be described as "rational irrationality", which is paradoxical. My prior is that this is well warranted sometimes. </p>

<p>Galef diffuses this paradox and explains what's going on clearly and succinctly. What's happening is that two meanings of rationality are being used: </p>

<ul>
<li>Instrumental rationality involves the pursuit of a particular end goal, by any means necessary.</li>
<li>Epistemic rationality involves achieving accurate beliefs about the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to rephrase the paradox is to diffuse it: it may be <strong>instrumentally</strong> rational to be <strong>epistemically</strong> irrational. This is highly related to <em>Information Hazards</em>.</p>

<h1>Always strive for epistemic rationality</h1>

<p>Galef argues the "тайное становятся явным" idea, something <a href="https://vseskazki.su/dragunskii-deniskiny-rasskazy/tajnoe-stanovitsya-yavnym.html">I grew up with</a>. Lying to yourself has the same downsides as other social lies that beget more lies. The cascade of muddled thinking proceeds with potentially very long delays and unpredictable outcomes. This is a good argument.</p>

<p>Elon Musk assigned a 10% chance of success to his ventures Space X and Tesla, but decided it was worth trying anyway. Mainly because of the cool factor and his ideological considerations. Green energy!! Electric cars!! Also, space!! But also, rationally speaking, the expected outcome was still high, since the impact of being successful was potentially so great. This resonates with me too, and part of why I think it's worth starting an early stage company one day.</p>

<p>But I still struggle with the absolutist framing that Galef presents. Surely there are situations where you would rather not have maximum rationality? Perhaps actual Infohazards? Or information that would best not be known to you. For example, if you somehow knew exactly how long you would live, it's easy to imagine negative second order effects.</p>

<h1>Thought experiments for clearer thinking</h1>

<p>Sometimes, if you're about to make a difficult decision, Galef suggests trying one of these thought experiments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The double standard test</strong>. Are you judging one individual or group by a standard that is different from other individuals or groups?</li>
<li><strong>The outsider test</strong>: how would you evaluate this situation if it wasn’t your situation?</li>
<li><strong>The conformity test</strong>. If other people no longer held the view, would you no longer hold it?</li>
<li><strong>The selective skeptic test</strong>. If this evidence supported the other side, how credible would you judge it to be?</li>
<li><strong>Status quo bias test</strong>. If your current situation was not the status quo, would you actively choose it?</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect the hardest part about Galef's advice is being sufficiently mindful to decide that now is a good time to try.</p>

<p>The idea of calibrated bets is a great one that I've incorporated into my New Years routine. I set predictions for a year ahead on all fronts (SSC, AK inspired) and then see how well calibrated I am. </p>

<p>However generating probabilities for predictions is always tricky. Galef also introduces a technique for called the <strong>equivalent bet test</strong>, which she attributes to Douglas Hubbard. The way it works is to compare the issue at hand to a simpler scenario where you randomly draw balls from a jar. One of N balls in the jar is black, and the rest are white. You play with which N would feel right so that both bets yield the same winnings.</p>

<h1>Celebrity calibration</h1>

<p>I love that Galef picks on Spock, who is often considered a model of rationality. By showing how poorly calibrated he is, she also dispels the idea that being rational means being robotic and failing to understand humans. </p>

<p>In spirit of Spock’s poor calibration, what can we say about Elon Musk's calibration? He gave 10% chance of success to two of his successful companies!</p>

<h1>Epistemic vs. social confidence</h1>

<p><em>Social confidence vs. epistemic confidence</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Soldier as press secretary: extremely high social confidence, and artificially
inflated, unawarranted epistemic confidence.</li>
<li>Scout as board of directors: calibrated epistemic confidence. Knowing what is
really true is extremely important.</li>
</ul>

<p>Her example of Vitalik Buterin is maybe slightly unfortunate. He seems really smart, and appears to be well calibrated epistemically. But he is too dorky to be a paragon of social confidence, in my opinion.</p>

<h1>Keep your identity...?</h1>

<p>Julia Galef and Paul Graham are overly bearish on identity. But identity is what makes you who you are. By rooting it out you demolish your own uniqueness, traditions, original insights. In this sense I am in favor of intersectionality, but broadly construed. Diversity (see <em>Measuring non-woke diversity broadly</em>) not of skin color and gender but of substantive and nuanced things like having been homeschooled, or being a practicing orthodox Christian or believing in Gaia theory or the fact that you raised three children on a 30’ sailboat circumnavigating the globe. Maybe you are super old and survived the Leningrad blockade. Maybe you grew up in desperate poverty. Or even, that you grew up as the son of a Saudi Prince. These things will give you a different perspective on life, and are genuinely valuable to bring to the table.</p>

<p>Great. Reminder. About. Righteous. Sentences. Produced. By. Emphatic. Use. Of. Periods. </p>

<p>I 👋 Should 👋 Use 👋 This 👋 Trick 👋 Way 👋 More 👋 Often.</p>

    <title>History of Future Cities by Daniel Brook</title>

        <p>This book explores planned cities over the centuries, built in the not-west to emulate western iconic cities: St. Petersburg, Mumbai, Shanghai, and Dubai. The whole east-west distinction is a bit funny, and the author disparages it by the end. The selection of cities is also a bit arbitrary.</p>

<p>I usually read books linearly, having never quite mastered the art of skimming. However in this book, each chapter covers one period of each city's history, and I decided to read the St. Petersburg sections first. I learned a lot about my birth-city, piecing together little stories that I'd known into a grander narrative, and filling in new ones. The architectural tour aspect of the book also pleasantly surprised me.</p>

<p>But there were also shortcomings. First, there are strange factual errors. For example, Kunstkamera was not the first public museum in the world, which the author claims (twice!). Second, liberties are taken to shoehorn the history of St. Pete into a very slick narrative centered around an idea that St. Petersburg is a fake city, a Potemkin village. This vantage point is somewhat disparaging, and profoundly western. I don't think Потёмкинские деревни have nearly the same cultural significance in Russia.</p>

<p>Ultimately I won't read the whole book, and can't broadly recommend this one unless you have personal ties to one of the cities.</p>

<hr />

<h1>St. Petersburg: 1703 - 1825</h1>

<p>German - немец shares a root with немой - mute. A general shorthand for all foreigners. </p>

<p>Peter I traveled incognito 🥸 thru Amsterdam as Peter Mikhailov. He got an internship at a shipyard and truly lived that life for four months. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amsterdam was a kind of factory for creating modern people… just as a well designed sawmill could transform rough timber into uniform usable planks so too a city, if properly designed could shape even the toughest hewn barbarians into civilized men and women. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Very Le Corbusier: A house is a machine for living in)</p>

<p>Witnessing the parliament of William III shortly after the glorious revolution, Peter remarked that it was good that the ruler was given counsel, but to be bound by any of it was an outrage. </p>

<p>Peter concluded his trip to Holland with realization of importance of sea port. But Russia was landlocked, so he conquered St. Petersburg which was Swedish at the time. </p>

<p>As a modernization means, Peter forced all men to shave their beards and cut off the flowing sleeves of their caftans. </p>

<p>St. Petersburg was built by serfs on 6 month tours of duty. Peter ordered 40,000 a year. And they didn't even have wheelbarrows. Known as a “city built on bones”. Peter boasted 100,000 died building it. Reminds me of <em>Roman slaves were cheaper than machines</em></p>

<p>Peter mandated travel by boat, but banned oars to force his people to learn how to sail by the wind alone. Nobles were gifted sailboats whose size corresponded to their rank. Peter built canals throughout the city to facilitate travel by water, but neglected to consider that they would freeze in winter.</p>

<p>Peter imported books on architecture and employed hundreds of foreign architects. His lead was <strong>Dominico Trezzini</strong>. The city arose out of imported theory rather than locally rooted processes, and tended towards extremes. </p>

<p>The Kunstkamera, constructed in 1727 was the first public museum in Russia (author claims the world, but AFAICT it's The Ashmolean in Oxford, c. 1683), where Peter hoped to educate the general public. When his aides suggested he charge for entry, he even provided visitors with vodka and snacks. </p>

<p>Peter began hosting concerts of instrumental music, which was illegal in Moscow because god had to be praised by the human voice alone. He imported French salons as “assemblies” which he observed in Paris.</p>

<p>In Moscow, the German quarter was cordoned off from the rest of city out of fears that foreigners would corrupt the Russians with their unorthodox ways. In St. Petersburg, the немцы were integrated and were allowed to build non-orthodox churches and even conduct services in foreign languages. </p>

<p>By 1720 st. Pete had population of 40,000. Thirty years before, it was a swamp. </p>

<p>Peters son Alexis did not approve of St. Petersburg, thinking it was too western facing. He attempted a coup and vowed to return the capital to Moscow. Peter sentenced his own son to death in 1717. </p>

<p>Peter was succeeded by Anna, an empress and intellectual lightweight who did little and reverted to frivolity. She built the worlds largest ice palace. But she also commissioned the winter palace (hermitage) done by <strong>Bartolommeo Rastreli</strong>. Was she all that useless?</p>

<p>Catherine married Peter's grandson Peter III and took the throne in 1762. By then the city's population was 100,000. She followed in Peter's footsteps, turning it westward again. She hired <strong>Giacomo Quarenghi</strong>. All architects seemed to have been inspired by Palladio. </p>

<p>Catherine amassed European art. Her collection of 4000 paintings rivaled what generations of French kings collected in the Louvre for four centuries. </p>

<p>Catherine corresponded with Voltaire, who wrote a hagiography of Peter I. She imported Voltaire's works and invited Diderot to Russia. His stay was short lived since he had some radically egalitarian ideas. He saw Russia as a blank slate that was easier to reform than Europe. (Prescient given the communist revolution to come). Ultimately Diderot was booted for suggesting to dismantle Russian serfdom, a system of “masters and slaves”, which was the last straw. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not only was the empress seeking advice from foreign experts when Peter had vowed that Russia would “show Europe its ass”, but when they offered advice to empower the people, the empress refused to take it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Catherine did take some advice. And attempted to bring open debate by running public salons in the winter palace. But the French Revolution of 1789 changed this openness. And her lieutenant Radischev wrote a French Revolution inspired “Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow”, highly sympathetic to the plight of serfs, including plans for abolition. This closed the window for Catherine and Russia was firmly an autocracy. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open debate would reign within the winter palace even as autocracy prevailed outside its walls. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Alexander I, grandson of Catherine, defeated napoleon and entered Paris in 1814, Peter the Great's vision of modernity without democracy was fulfilled. Russia was compared to Rome and Alexander I went on a building spree, rapping <strong>Carlo Rossi</strong>, who trained in Rome. He was most famous for the general staff building and an arch. </p>

<p>French influences were still prominent even after 1814. <strong>Auguste de Montferrand</strong> redesigned the St. Isaac's cathedral. In his bid he presented oil paintings of many possible styles: Indian, Chinese, Byzantine, green etc. but the choice was obvious: giant gilded neoclassical dome. Just like the best of Europe!</p>

<p>As the Russian army marched through Europe pursuing the fleeing armies of Napoleon, they saw what Europe was like, and how much more advanced it was than Russia economically, socially, educationally and politically. St. Pete’s in contrast began to seem like a “Giant Potemkin village”.</p>

<p>This planted the seeds of the Decembrist revolt, organized by six members of the imperial guard, who wanted to bring constitutional government to Russia. Waiting for a succession, they vowed to make a move during the chaos that would ensue. Instead, they were massacred in front of the Hermitage.</p>

<p>Subsequently, to tamp down future rebellions, Nicholas I instituted a secret police to watch dissent, suggested that European travelers come back with criticism, and pared back liberal arts education to focus on technical subjects instead. The window to the west was closing. </p>

<h1>St. Petersburg: 1825 - 1934</h1>

<p>Mind blowing connection of the Russian word вокзал named after the first train station in Tsarskoe Selo, modeled after Vauxhall station in London. “A permanent reminder of Russia's cribbed modernity at its most blatant”.</p>

<p>Fittingly, the first railway line connected the capital with the tzar's residence, a vanity project. Meanwhile, a national railway network was nixed out of fear that “frequent purposeless travel would foster the restless spirit of our age”. Reminds me of the crackdown on <em>Parasitism in Soviet Russia</em>.</p>

<p>Funny: when European fashions changed to wearing facial hair, Petersburgers followed suit, reversing Peter's decree. Gogol mocks this in “Nevsky prospect”.</p>

<p>The Crimean War loss at the end of Nicholas I's rule was a wake up call. His son Alexander II took the reigns and undid many of the harshest policies of his predecessors. He freed the serfs in 1861, freeing 22 million people and set Russia up for an industrial path.</p>

<p>Sept 1 1861: St. Petersburg University Rebellion demanding a democratically elected leader not a tzar. I've never heard of this, nor had dad, and so I dug in a bit. The author claims "the university was closed outright for two years", while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Imperial_University">Wikipedia says</a> "it was temporarily closed twice during the year".</p>

<p>Narodniks were student intellectuals that went to the people (народ) to try to spread revolutionary ideas. First they tried with pamphlets but the peasants were illiterate (hmm... really?). Then they tried with speeches and the peasants reported them to the tzar. By 1877, 1600 students were imprisoned in Peter and Paul fortress. </p>

<p>The radicals adopted another strategy. A new organization, The People's Will began to assassinate key regime officials. Alexander II had his liberal interior minister draw up plans to ease censorship, abolish secret police and allow elected representatives to vote in national affairs. Alas, the peoples will succeeded after six attempts to assassinate the tzar. </p>

<p>Instead of triggering a revolution, they triggered succession, and Alexander III was far more conservative than his father. Rather than moving the capital back to Moscow, he brought Moscow to St. Petersburg by erecting a large cathedral: Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. This structure designed by an archimandrite (orthodox title) with no architectural background, stood out like a sore thumb in the middle of the city. “A deliberate intrusion of the real Russia onto the Petersburg scene”.</p>

<p>Alexander II spurred economic development and sent his finance minister Michael von Reutern to pitch Russia as an emerging market with western conveniences and convenient labor practices. Workers were cheap, had no rights, no ability to speak freely, publish, march, or vote. This was a resounding success and Russia grew at 8% per year from 1860-1900. The Russia American red triangle rubber factory 🔺🏭 was built then. My grandparents worked there for decades. That's where they met.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the city was densifying as more and more peasant workers were moving in. Soon it was twice as crammed as Paris, Berlin, or Vienna. The death rate was highest of all European cities in 1870. Peterburgers topped the nation in vodka consumption, crime was rampant, prostitution was legal and ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Mass education was one of the rare successful social endeavor in St. Petersburg around this time. By 1910, 80% of the population was literate, and this mass literacy was a social innovation the elite would come to regret.</p>

<p>Singer Sewing Machine an example of another company establishing Russian HQ. The Singer Building was architecturally notable. One of many, though.</p>

<p>Putilov Works was a giant ironworks employing 12,000 people, operated by the richest merchant oligarch family of the era. Attempts were made to control them by building incongruous churches adjacent to the plant, but this failed. Eventually, under Gregory Gapon, workers organized and went on strike when four of them were fired for joining the union. In 1905, a general strike extended to 120,000 Petersburgers. A petition was extended demanding freedom of speech, press and assembly, free public education, minimum wage, an eight hour work day, and legalization of unions.</p>

<p>Five thousand protesters led by Gapon were joined by curious sympathizers as they marched along Nevsky prospect. By the time they converged onto the Winter palace, 60,000 men, women, and children awaited. What followed was a massacre claiming 1,000 lives called “Bloody Sunday”, when Tzarist troops opened fire. What followed was a revolution in which the weak tzar Nicholas II, recently defeated by Japan, escaped to Tsarskoe Selo. Eventually the people got what they wanted: autocracy was abolished and a parliament (the Duma) was founded.</p>

<p>However this democratic stint was short lived. In 1906, nearly half of the Duma’s representatives were rural peasants, underscoring Russia’s backwardness (really?). Further, Nicholas II dissolved the Duma and called for new elections. He did this repeatedly to limit the socialists in its ranks.</p>

<p>Nicholas II became increasingly insular, hiding from the people in Tsarskoe Selo. He pined for the Russia before Peter the Great turned westward, adopting the title tzar (instead of emperor, preferred by Peter and used by many Russian monarchs). He wore a beard, a caftan with long impractical sleeves, and commissioned his architects to build the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80_(%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD)">Feodorov village</a>, a mini walled town modeled after the 17th century. </p>

<p>In St. Petersburg, he built the Romanov Tercentenary to commemorate the 300 anniversary of Romanov rule.</p>

<p>World War I gave Nicholas the opportunity to turn populist. A crowd of 250,000 sang “боже царя храни”, and then burnt the German embassy to the ground. He renamed the city to Petrograd since “burg” was viewed as too German. No matter that it was named after Holland.</p>

<p>But the jubilation was short lived, and massive casualties begat draft dodgers, crowds chanting “Down with the autocracy”, singing the Marseillaise, and rioting. Police stations, prisons, courthouses were torched. Protesters were killed by the dozens, and soon the army refused to fire on more people.</p>

<p>Nicholas abdicated the throne and gave up power to his brother, who also refused it. A temporary government was set up under Kerensky.</p>

<p>Some concessions were given to the labor movement: an eight hour work day. But real wages plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed. </p>

<p>Lenin’s Bolsheviks called for national transformation, echoing Peter the greats conviction he could autocratically wrench Russia into the modern world without having to wait for more organic development from below. </p>

<p>After the successful October revolution, Lenin found himself in a civil war which erupted against an alliance of opponents aided by anti-communist western powers like Britain, France, and the USA. The capital was moved from Petrograd to Moscow for military strategic reasons. </p>

<p>In the Kremlin centuries ago, a bearded theocratic elite ruled Russia following eternal truths of church teachings. Now a new class of grey men would rule according to the holy canon of official Bolshevik doctrine. (Really?)</p>

<p>After the civil war was won and the whites were crushed, major changes came to St. Petersburg. Originally the gateway through which European ideas including Marx’s flowed into the country. When Lenin came to power, new ideas became a threat. Lenin quickly set up the Cheka secret police to stifle Petrograd's “embittered bourgeoisie intelligencia”. Meanwhile wages fell and food became scarce and Petrograd dropped from 2.3 million in 1918 to 0.7 million in 1920 (!!) as workers returned to their villages and became peasants again. (Shocking drop— was it due to foreign divestment?)</p>

<p>Worker strikes spread to the naval installation of Kronstadt, and 10,000 sailors rose up against Bolshevism. The rebellion was crushed violently but made Lenin lay off Petrograd and give the city a bit of breathing room. When Lenin died in 1924 the city was renamed in his honor. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Russia felt to the exterior world like once again a promising blank slate as under Catherine the great. This time there were more talented Russians  to lead the charge. </p>

<p>The Bauhaus movement found eager home in the Soviet state. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatlin%27s_Tower">Tatlin's Tower</a> was an ambitious modern example of such a project but was never built for lack of funds. </p>

<p>Constructivism became Russia's distinctive style of modernism integrating obsession with geometry and perspective. Example: <a href="http://architectuul.com/architecture/gorky-palace-of-culture">Palace of Culture</a>. <a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2301/on-tractor-street">Tractornaya Ulitsa</a> homes were a tasteful update on classic Petersburg forms. I'm reminded of <em>Palaces for the People by Eric Klinenberg</em>, just making the connection from the name.</p>

<p><strong>Erich Mendelssohn</strong> was brought to design red banner factory in 1925, which looked like a giant ocean liner ready to set sail. </p>

<p>This period of early soviet avant-garde was short lived as cultural conservatives gained the upper hand, chief among them Stalin. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As in the Age of Enlightenment, Russia’s window on the west birthed dreams of a glorious future only to smother them. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>St. Petersburg: 1934 - 1985</h1>

<p>Using Kirov’s murder as pretext, Stalin issued an order expediting political investigations. The soviet constitution did guarantee some civil liberties, but these no longer applied. It’s now widely believed that Kirov was killed on Stalin’s orders too. Anyway, the result was a giant supposed conspiracy in which thousands of Russians were accused of being in cahoots with western capitalist powers.</p>

<p>The Great Purge ultimately took millions of people. Not just active party cadres, but anyone politically or intellectually active, including my great grandfather. “Black Ravens” would come by night in black vans and disappear “enemies of the people”. And most of these were in Leningrad, a gateway to western ideas which helped launch the revolution, and was now such a threat to the new regime.</p>

<p>Stalin likely admired Hitler’s June 1934 Night of the Long Knives, in which he orchestrated murder of his fellow Nazi Party founders.</p>

<p>During his decades of rule, Stalin hardly ever set foot in Leningrad, made many attempts to downgrade it to just another city. Even in the first five year plan in 1928, Stalin focused on industrializing the rest of the country, divesting from Leningrad. The Bolsheviks renamed the streets around Спас на Крови after the names of the murderers of Alexander II, but Stalin changed the names back, to ensure those that rise up against their leaders were not glorified.</p>

<p>Stalinist architecture was built with neoclassical facades, replacing modernist avant-guard of the old soviet state. These structures were massive and imposing, a return to order reminiscent of the Romanovs, but also epitomizing high modernism. An example of this is House of the Soviets, and everywhere, giant statue of Lenin loomed.</p>

<p>Hitler called Leningrad “the poisonous nest from which, for so long, Asiatic venom has spewed forth into Europe”, and aimed for full destruction. Awesome!</p>

<p>Head of Hermitage <strong>Iosif Orbeli</strong>, anticipating German invasion, packed half a million objects and sent them east to Sverdlovsk just before the Germans severed the rail connections, as the city was falling apart.</p>

<p>By 1941, the Germans had fully cut off food supplies from Leningrad. Once the crumbs were consumed, tens of thousands of died a month. People survived eating binding glue from books, boiling belts into thin soup, eating mysterious meat patties. Over a million died in the 900 day siege. And this is not ancient history — my grandfather lived through this.</p>

<p>Stalin may have been deliberately slow to stop the siege, as he watched the city he hated be crushed by Nazi air raids. The Smolny party headquarters were camouflaged, while great buildings like St. Isaac’s and the Admiralty were not. And party members were not starving like the commoners. Their only wartime rule was: no seconds of meat!</p>

<p>Throughout all this in 1941, a strike broke out at Kirov Works (formerly Putilov Works), where strikers demanded an end to Stalin’s Russia. This in the context of being fully cut off from the rest of Russia was a fascinating political threat from within. </p>

<p>The history associated with this period did not jive well with the party line. The curator of the Blockade Museum, which opened a few months after the end of the war, was promptly shot, and museum closed. Even the official Monument to the Defenders of Leningrad did not open until the 70’s.</p>

<p>Stalin's personality cult continued, and globalism was further curtailed. The Internationale, which called for universal proletarian solidarity was replaced with the soviet anthem, which name dropped Stalin. International Prospect was renamed after Stalin too.</p>

<p>In menial jobs there was no pressure to join the Party, so people took them, punched in, and spent the workday writing music and poetry. 1949 confiscation of saxophones. What.</p>

<p>Never heard of "Санкт Петербург" the punk band, actually pretty good, look up Владимир Рекшан.</p>

<h1>St. Petersburg: 1985 - ~now</h1>

<p>Under Gorbachev the city turned westward again and people made great strides in civil rights, especially of speech and assembly. </p>

<p><strong>Angleterre Hotel</strong>, a historical landmark was due to be razed in 1987. A crowd gathered to protest and the leader was told by officials that no such thing would happen. Half an hour later the hotel was demolished. A sign of the times, rather than dispersing the crowd stood its ground and formed an “information point”, dissenting in public. Known as Battle of the Angleterre.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Mikhailovsky Garden</strong>, Peter's assemblies and Catherine’s salons were revived on Saturday afternoons. This “Hyde Park” was shutdown and then moved to Nevsky prospect!</p>

<p>I didn't know the new name of the city was decided by popular referendum in June 1991. Choices were Leningrad and St. Petersburg. Solzhenitsyn wanted Svyato-Petrograd which is a bit awkward, and never made ballot. </p>

<p>Anatoly Sobchak, former head of Leningrad Soyuz was elected as head of Leningrad mayor of St. Petersburg. He aimed to turn the city into a special economic zone after China. He established ties with us universities and mega corps like Coca Cola and Gillette began opening offices in St. Pete. </p>

<p>Rather than a China-style transition to market economy slowly weaning unproductive industry from subsidies, St. Pete endorsed immediate removal of price controls, calling it “shock therapy”. The result was skyrocketing prices, "all shock and no therapy". Interesting debate about Shock Therapy between Joseph Stiglitz (against) and Jeffrey Sachs (in favor). Look into it later.</p>

<p>Major industries were converted into private companies and Russians were given a share worth 20$ of the new companies. Ownership was soon concentrated by those that had secretly accumulated money, taking advantage of cash strapped Russians. These new oligarchs rather than build up the companies, decided to sell everything and, and make out like bandits, literally. The St. Petersburg economists that endorsed this were so taken by the beauty of their theories that they were blinded by the damage on the ground. They became known as "Market Bolsheviks".</p>

<p>Western firms found that they needed to be headquartered in Moscow, since that is where the clique in power was based. Even Maersk, the Dutch shipping giant, moved their Russian headquarters to landlocked Moscow.</p>

<p>The early 90s were extremely rough: from 1990 to 1995, the number of Russians living on $4 a day or less went from 2M to 60M. Life expectancy went from 68.5 to 64.5. "everything Marx said about communism was wrong, but everything he said about capitalism was right"</p>

<p>By 1998, the ruble had collapsed. This economic chaos began to be associated with democracy in the Russian mind, and the people pined for a strong leader. Putin's Russia would be autocracy reborn. The next bits go into Putin's biography, mostly a rehash of <em>Nothing is True and Everything is Possible</em>. Notably Putin consolidated TV networks under state control. Gasprom, the giant government owned conglomerate, benefited greatly from spikes in oil demand in the early 21st century. </p>

<p>The last St. Pete gubernatorial election was in 2003. In 2004, a law was passed that makes heads of all "federal subjects" (provinces, republics, territories, federal cities like St. Pete) appointed directly by the President of Russia. In the west we have checks and balances. In Russia we have check and mate (I made that up)</p>

<p>Valentina Matviyenko, Putin's puppet established the city as a Potemkin village, polishing the center but letting the heart rot. Russian visas are hard to come by, but it's very easy to get a 48 hour visa if you're coming to St. Pete on a Baltic cruise. Just enough time to get the "wow feels so european" vibe, spend some Euros, and get the fuck out.</p>

<h1>Overarching themes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Alexander II, Lenin and Gorbachev all embraced western ideas, and brought foreign influence to Russia and St. Pete.</li>
<li>But this spurred on a powerful countervailing force administered by rulers like Alexander I, Nicholas I, and Stalin that wanted Russia to look inwardly.</li>
<li>Even the western facing rulers avoided embracing political freedom and democracy. The trend continues to this day.</li>
<li>Great architecture, often built by foreign architects or under the auspices of some great Italian or French designs.</li>
<li>The Russians cribbed from the French. But the Germans cribbed from the Romans, and the Romans cribbed from the Greeks. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>That the Romans copied doesn't mean that history is nothing but copying, but it does mean that copying is an integral part of history. [...] The US too, like the Germans and the Romans, consciously wrote itself into the western tradition.</p>

    <title>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism by Max Weber</title>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism-by-max-weber</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Max Weber piqued my interest in an overview course in philosophy <em>The Modern Political Tradition - Hobbes to Habermas</em>. I took a note about Weber's ideas then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends. Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When GB suggested that Weber's translated works were readable, I decided to take the plunge. Weber is sometimes long winded. The last sections seem to go deep into narrow protestant sub-sects and associated thinkers. Zinzendorf, Herrnhut and the Pietists were just a bit too much for me. I found this section to be repetitive and overly detailed. But other times, the text was so dense and rich I actually had to slow the audio book narration to below real-time, which is a first for me. If you are tempted to skim, be sure to read the last chapters.</p>

<p>According to Weber, Protestants in general are characterized by a strong piety and a remarkable proficiency at their trade. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Striking] is the connection of a religious way of life with the most intensive development of business acumen among those sects whose otherworldliness is proverbial as their wealth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I think of a devoutly religious person, I think of them giving their whole life to god. My intuitive model is that of the Baal Shem Tov who spent every waking minute reading the Torah. Or a “athlete of god” who turns to extreme asceticism as a reaction to excesses of the established clergy.</p>

<p>Weber makes a sharp distinction: the Protestant work ethic is diametrically opposed to 1) joie de vivre and also to 2) aspirations for worldly progress. Instead, this work ethic is one tied to a deep faith. He cites Montesqieu, that the English have "progressed the farthest of all peoples of the world in three important things: in piety, in commerce, and in freedom." Weber's work focuses on the relationship between the first two.</p>

<h1>Satisfaction vs. acquisition</h1>

<p>Interesting distinction between:</p>

<ol>
<li>Satisfaction of needs and</li>
<li>Acquisition beyond those needs. </li>
</ol>

<p>Economic traditionalism is exemplified in (1). But capitalism is mostly (2), an acquisitive economy. </p>

<p>The acquisitive economy relies on money and wealth as a measure of how well you have done your job. </p>

<p>The idea of a calling irrational and is associated with Protestantism according to Weber. He will tease this out in chapter 3. </p>

<h1>The Calling: from monasticism to craftsmanship</h1>

<p>Luther said that the fulfillment of worldly activity is the best way to worship the lord. </p>

<p>In the early Catholic Church, the notion of a calling was often applied to a monastic lifestyle. Worldly duties were derided. The individual should stay in the station he was given at birth and glorify god.</p>

<p>Luther translated this notion into something much more worldly. Religious authority was not reduced, but the calling could force you to pursue a path divergent from the station provided at birth. </p>

<p>The emphasis thus shifted from an unending glorification of god to a creation of god-glorifying works, fruits of your craft. I think of J. S. Bach as an exemplar of this attitude. Even mom has said that at her best, her hands are moved by god's grace.</p>

<p>The emphasis on works reminds me of <em>Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</em>, in which students' works are harvested in order to prove that clone-students are worthy of salvation.</p>

<p>Weber enumerates protestant denominations that contributed to this solid work ethic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calvinism/Reformed (Presbyterians)</li>
<li>Pietism, a Calvinist-adjacent branch within Lutheranism. </li>
<li>Methodism, which split off from Anglicanism.</li>
<li>Sects from the Baptist movement.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Brief aside on protestant sects</h1>

<p>I've always found protestant denominations to be very confusing, and here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism#/media/File:Protestant_branches.svg">a
diagram I found helpful</a>.</p>

<p>I also spent a couple of hours trying to understand a bit beyond what the book has to offer, and here are my findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all branches of Protestantism stem from Luther directly. Some seem to be inspired by his disobedience, but don't inherit from Lutheranism directly.</li>
<li>Anglicanism was started by Henry VIII, a few decades after Luther (details of the story I will skip here). Puritans dissented against the Anglican church, demanding extreme divergence from Catholicism. </li>
<li>Methodists are a sort of Puritan revival, also splitting off from Anglicans. Their name comes from "method".</li>
<li>Weber refers to Moravians. These are followers of Jan Hus (mentioned in <em>Late Middle Ages</em>, and predates Luther by sixty years (!)</li>
<li><p>Speaking of schisms, it's fascinating to watch two different strategies in the Christian world:</p>

<ol>
<li>Catholic schisms and re-unifications, all the while maintaining a unified organization.</li>
<li>Protestant forks and a branching hierarchy of denominations.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h1>Predestination and its implications</h1>

<p>The strongest formulation of Calvinist concept of double predestination was that before birth, all people were destined to either go to heaven or burn in hell, regardless of their deeds. And which bucket you fell into was unknown until your death. For Calvin, man is created for god, not god for man. His decrees thus don’t need to be pleasant in the slightest. For the damned to complain of their lot is the same as animals complaining that they were not born as men. For god to change his mind on the basis of some earthly human actions would diminish his power. Puritans share the same view of predestination as Calvinists.</p>

<p>For Luther, the doctrine of predestination was initially important, but faded over time. The Lutheran concept of predestination is "single predestination", meaning that some people are pre-destined for salvation, but nobody is pre-destined for damnation.</p>

<p>This was a huge difference between Catholicism and Calvinism/Puritanism: for the Puritans, no amount of sacrament or worship was going to get you into heaven. So they deliberately avoided doing any ritualized burial, as that was seen as superstition. From this stemmed a general aversion to anything sensuous and emotional in culture and religion. These are no use towards salvation, merely deluding people via idolatrous superstition. </p>

<p><strong>Against magic</strong>: For the Puritan, the Catholic tradition looked as if “the priest was a magician who performed the miracle of transubstantiation and held the key to eternal life in his hand”. As a result, they made their project to "eliminate magic as a means of absolution".</p>

<p><strong>Individualism</strong>: This doctrine forms the roots of a disillusioned individualism. Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" is the most read Protestant book. The protagonist named Christian abandons his family to escape from the "City of Destruction" (this world), to the "Celestial City" (heaven). Once safe, he remembers that he should probably also bring his family too...</p>

<p><strong>Self-confidence</strong>: The elect and the damned do not differ in any way. This wasn’t a problem for Calvin, who felt himself obviously chosen. But for many others was not tenable, as everyone would wonder endlessly whether they are in a state of grace. The result is that all people must act with self confidence as if they are in a state of Grace, and avoid doubt at all cost. (The basis of high self confidence in the west?)</p>

<p><strong>Unbounded piety</strong>: In this view, Catholics live with “hand to mouth” piety. They try to be good but inevitably stray from the ideal, and then need to offset their misdeeds via confession or sacrament. In contrast, the Puritan would need to act as if they were in a state of grace, constantly are outdoing themselves in their piety. There is no upper bound on piety if you are truly one of the chosen. (Does this piety then translate into money in the modern age?).</p>

<p>(Is there predestination in Judaism?)</p>

<h1>Emphasis on works</h1>

<p>This more modern interpretation of the calling is intimately tied to producing great works. For Lutherans it wasn’t enough to do righteous works. They insisted on an emotional component. For them, the feeling of grace was needed to actually attain salvation (aka state of grace). For a Calvinist this was just empty emotion.</p>

<p>According to the Puritans, works are not the cause but only the proof of a state of grace, and only if the works are done for the glory of god alone. He who did not perform good works was not a true believer. The harshness of Calvinism continues to astound.</p>

<h1>Ben Franklin's post-religious take</h1>

<p>At first Weber appears to lambaste Ben Franklin for being overly pragmatic as he describes the “spirit of capitalism”, in a passage from his autobiography. Franklin's virtues are all merely a means to an end. In the end, if you are virtuous, you will have good standing with money lenders. This uncharitable take is very easy to mock, and has been done effectively by Ferdinand Kurnberger, who in "Picture of American Culture" describes Americans thus: "They make tallow out of cattle and money out of men."</p>

<p>But Weber gives Franklin a much more charitable interpretation. Franklin's response to “why should money be made from men?” comes from his strict Calvinist father: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings. — Proverbs 22:29</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Weber's account, Franklin philosophy as written in his autobiography is not greed at all, but a direct continuation of puritan ideals. Franklin was a self avowed deist, far less religious than his pious Puritan predecessors. </p>

<h1>Three attitudes to wealth</h1>

<ol>
<li>Wealth for its own sake, because of the desire to be wealthy. (Greed)</li>
<li>Wealth for the sake of a carefree life. (Sloth)</li>
<li>Wealth as a side effect of following your calling. </li>
</ol>

<p>The Calvinist/Puritan tradition holds that (3) is acceptable, but the rest are sinful. If your calling happens to be entrepreneurship, then wealth of your company is basically the explicitly endorsed goal. </p>

<p>Another pious angle on accumulating wealth is one of eventually giving it away. This idea of "earning to give" is quite old. </p>

<h1>Modernity (well, circa 1905)</h1>

<p>And so Max Weber us forced into this mandatory system of a calling, works, originally set out as an optional path.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresitible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the “saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.” But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weber ends with a meta point. Modern man consistently underestimates the importance of religious influences in shaping modernity.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind is an interesting deep dive into the way
that consciousness evolved throughout history, especially as a result of
literacy. I guess this is the Illich version of Orality and Literacy (which I
have not yet read). </p>

<p>In general, the book is overly declamatory, often feels like a sermon. Parts of it are more literary critique, especially where Illich/Sanders delves into specific literary works (Chaucer's Canterbury, Defoe's Journal, Twain's Huck Finn) and tries to make sweeping generalizations based on their novels. Arguments rely mostly on wordplay and clever assertions, but are often unconvincing.</p>

<p>Sections correspond to chapters in the book that I thought were vaguely interesting:</p>

<h1>Text</h1>

<p>The spread of writing turned society upside down in almost every domain. But the authors consider the subtler side. Everything we know about that society is conveyed to us through writing, including everything we know of the oral tradition of the time, leading to a paradox of “oral writing”. </p>

<p>With literacy, trust shifted from a spoken promise in the form of an oath, to a sealed document. Oaths were a conditional curse: let me be maimed if I break this promise. Formerly formulaic speeches like the Danes “by the ships side and the shields rim, by the swords edge and the horses thigh”, ritualized by raising weapon skyward and placing a foot on a stone. Instead of oaths, literacy led to a more legal and binding form of promise. It’s no surprise that we now use the book in the “pantomime of legal gesture”. </p>

<p>Authors points to a rapid increase in writing in the 13th century based on consumption of parchment and sealing wax. According to some records (uncited?), the numbers were 3 pounds a week in 1226, 13 in 1256, 31 in 1266. Similarly, the authors point to the number of recorded royal decrees  1080-1180: 3 to 60 for French kings, 25 to 115 for the English, 22 to 180 for popes. After that it’s exponential. From Pope Innocent III ending in 1215, 280 survive, Innocent IV ending in 1254, 730 survive, Boniface VIII ending in 1303, 50000.</p>

<p>Wills also became determined not by last words on the deathbed or a symbol imbued with meaning but by a sealed document. This transition happened in 12th century when symbols began to be engraved with explicit writings. </p>

<p>Written documents also enabled trust to be formalized. The issuer would create two copies: one for themselves and one for the recipient. Technical details around this included the seal, a signature, a date, creating a copy and storing it in a catalog, which is part of a register. </p>

<p>High Middle Age monks simply remembered where things were without a system. Earliest known scrutinium (monastic catalogs) were introduced in 1170. This is also the advent of libraries. </p>

<p>Writing enabled exact copying of materials, which became desirable. In 1283 Cambridge hired its first corrector whose job was to check documents according to form, legibility, word order, and spelling. Documents being identical became a criteria for legal validity. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two hundred years before Gutenberg, archives gave rise to the intellectual prototype of printer matter: an original from which a number of identical copies had been produced and written. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even people required “identification” (written credentials that are identical to your person). No wonder the domesday book doesn't include a list of people — there was probably no accounting of individuals at all at the time.</p>

<p>Around this time a written chronicle of time emerged too, an essential piece of cataloging many charters. Notaries would travel around and witness and date major transactions around them, from the birth of the Lord. This gave a new dimension to text: time. Documents could be ordered by recency. Time in general grows in importance as a result. In the dance of death genre, the hourglass is prominently displayed. Time is scarce. </p>

<p>In the 12th century, news needed to be proclaimed orally (by a herald, “heard”) for it to be official. The written copy (if any) was just a record of the oral delivery. A signet ring served as seal and was accompanied with arbitrary and ever changing signature. But then as courts became more concerned with authenticity, this practice changed into the 14th century and onwards. The author also writes that vellum (calf) was replaced with membranum (sheep) supposedly thinner, harder to erase and prevented forgeries. (This is surprising since I think vellum was more sought after). Slowly text became the medium of guarantee. </p>

<p>This is reflected in art: The Last Judgement involves the Archangel Michael depicted with a book in which the text of ones life is recorded and decisions made. </p>

<p>Early “writing” did not involve clutching a pen and drawing letters on parchment, but dictating to a scribe. So initially there was a gulf between writer and author. Wax tablets also played some role in writing, mostly for temporary note taking. (Interesting that this hasn't really been a focus in other works I've read on this topic.)</p>

<p>Words were initially not separated at all, but spaces between became common around the 7th century (confirm with <em>Carolingian minuscule</em>), in order to teach Latin to the barbarians as a foreign language. </p>

<p>Previously writing was arduous, inscribed with a knife on hard leather. New script emerged in the 13th century. This more circular cursive writing was easier to write using a quill on a smooth surface, on parchment or paper. By the 13th century scholars like Thomas Aquinas were writing on their own without the need for scribes, and drafts are preserved. </p>

<p>Later scholars had access to much smaller books which were portable and used as a reference enabling direct quotation from sources. But so far all quotations had to be made verbatim, since books were not structured in any way until 12th century. </p>

<p>Also see <em>Reading and writing transition in the 12th century</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to structured catalogs and libraries, books themselves became structured. Chapters and verses became the somewhat arbitrary superstructure placed after the fact over top the Old Testament only in 1200 (!). </p>

<p>Previously text and images were deeply interwoven. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtQAsvUiwPg">Book of Kells</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> provide two such examples. Now a monolithic text heavy manuscript was gaining shape, with structure and chapters and quotes separated visually from the rest of the content. </p>

<p>Another major change was that rather than always reading aloud, reading became a mostly silent pursuit. </p>

<h1>Self</h1>

<p>I enjoyed the Text chapter of this book, so decided to read on. The section on self is basically a great takedown of autobiographies. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Autobiography is born out of hubris. In Franklin's case his autobiography grows out of the hubris of America’s emerging power - its myths and ideals - a power that actually thrives on mistakes. One merely seized upon them as Franklin makes clear and turns them into substantial financial success. Autobiography amplifies that power: since a person is literally creating a new being, he can smooth out the rough transitions in his life, clean up the mistakes to produce a polished and attractive literary self. </p>

  <p>A chief obstacle to writing a modern autobiography is its ending. How can it end, really, reach its final conclusion, until the writer is dead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Malcolm X's autobiography is published posthumously. Maybe that's the ticket?</p>

<h1>Untruth and narration</h1>

<p>Love the Latin expression “ex suo digito suxit” - высосано из пальца - sucked out of ones finger. Finger and fiction are apparently connected through this? But I haven't been able to verify.</p>

<p>St Augustine defined every lie as an assault on the God given truth. A contempt of God. Fascinatingly this precludes fiction in the traditional sense of being fully invented. Epic bards retell old stories that really happened, not fictions. Storytellers too, are not inventing but retelling. Chaucer (1386) is supposedly the first English author to spin a tale. But he does this not explicitly, couching heavily. </p>

<p>Chaucer writes just as England is moving from a culture of orality to literacy. And finds himself in an awkward position between fact and fiction. He needs to have Canterbury story taken as truth “for this is the way readers come to enter into any fictional dream” and goes to great lengths to do this. He makes himself one of the pilgrims, and tells a story “Tale of Sir Thopas” which is so boring that the fictional hosts ask him to stop. But apparently “too much truth can get Chaucer into theological trouble”. Why???</p>

<p>Defoe writes a book entitled "Journal of the Plague Year" which is a semi-fictional journal of a man living in London in 1665, the last major plague outbreak. Authors claim that this is the first novel, but this is completely ludicrous. In fact Robinson Crusoe came before this Journal, which immediately nullifies many of the claims made. There are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_claimed_first_novels_in_English">many other candidates</a> for first novel too. Anyway, the authors really focus on the word “novel” and how it is closely related to “news” and shares the Latin root “novus”, new. Who cares?</p>

<p>By this point it is clear that this chapter has evolved into speculative literary criticism with very tenuous arguments based on word games. The end is especially cringeworthy, with a vast narrative being cobbled together on the basis of the three works encountered. It’s very shaky and very ideological and not convincing at all. A little reminiscent of Deschooling, but worse.</p>

<h1>Newspeak and UNIQUACK</h1>

<p>Speculative literary criticism continues into the 20th century, this time with Orwell's 1984. Fascinating pointers, but not much substance. </p>

<p>Basic English was a subset of English (less than 1000 words) popular in the 1950s as a universal language designed to increase international collaboration. Apparently Orwell was into it initially, then worked for the institute promulgating it and realized this was a terrible idea.</p>

<p>The authors declare that words like energy, sexuality, transportation, education, communication, information, crisis, problem, solution, are too vague, and “amoeba-words”. I don't understand why. Many of these have precise meaning depending on context. Maybe the authors felt that people don’t generally know these precise meanings and misuse them?</p>

<h1>Silence</h1>

<p>Authors introduce an idea of “alphabetic silence”: pauses between words, silent contemplation of text, meditative thought. </p>

<p>I enjoyed the interpretation of the Ten Commandments. What did the Israelites hear when they received the ten commandments? A few theories:</p>

<ol>
<li>They heard them all in the Divine Voice</li>
<li>They heard only the first two: “I am the lord thy God”, and “thou shalt have no other gods before me”, before being overwhelmed. The rest had to be received through Moses. </li>
<li>They heard only aleph (א), with which the first commandment begins, the first letter of anochi (אנוכי), and silent without a patach, merely commanding the mouth to open. “Rabbi Mendel Torum transforms the revelation on Mount Sinai into a mystical revelation, pregnant with infinite meaning, but devoid of any specific one.”</li>
</ol>

      <div>
        <p>Tools for Thought are all the rage these days. Unfortunately, most of these tools assume one corpus per tool, and the interoperability story is <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/composability-with-other-tools">very poor</a>. At the same time, it's pretty clear to me that no single app can serve as my <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/browser/">second brain</a>. What I need instead is a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/adewale/tools-for-thought-from-the-memex-to-index-cards?slide=13">System for Thought</a> that supports many different tools working seamlessly together.</p>

<p>The solution I have arrived at is a cloud-synchronized directory of plaintext <a href="https://jenson.org/files">files</a> and images. Here's a visual summary of what's going on in my system for thought today:</p>

<p><img src="/file-systems-for-thought/fs-for-thought.jpg" alt="File Systems for Thought 2021" /></p>

<p>This system has two key advantages: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tool choice</strong>: I can choose my favorite among multiple existing tools</li>
<li><strong>Hackability</strong>: I can build my own tools to support specific needs</li>
</ol>

<!--more-->

<h1>Advantages: tool choice &amp; hackability</h1>

<p>One advantage of this approach is that I can pick and choose which editors to use across multiple platforms. On desktop, I tend to the corpus using Obsidian. On mobile, even though Obsidian recently launched an iOS app, I prefer to continue using iA Writer. Additionally, I can quickly jot notes using a Siri shortcut from an iPhone.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that as a programmer, I have full control to build solutions that work well for my needs. I've built my own scripts to synchronize reading highlights from Instapaper. I have multiple tools do automatically scheduled cleanup tasks, auto-deploy a subset of my corpus to the web. Below, I'll describe these components in more detail.</p>

<h1>Note corpus storage</h1>

<p>My notes are stored in a directory of plaintext markdown files. These are also interlinked with Wiki-style markup. They are currently synchronized to iCloud Drive to make interoperability with iOS easier, while still allowing the notes to be accessed across multiple devices.</p>

<p>In theory, I aim for terse, evergreen notes that use the <em>BLUF TLDR note taking style</em>. But in practice, I keep many kinds of notes in the same corpus, and rely extensively on title- and full-text search.</p>

<h2>Small ideas</h2>

<p>I use my note corpus for a lot of unimportant, practical things pretty far from any sort of intellectual pursuit. These include: </p>

<ul>
<li>temporary shopping lists</li>
<li>household notes, like car repair and nanny payments</li>
<li>notes from conversations with people (stored in <code>Meeting notes/</code>)</li>
<li>daily notes (stored in <code>Inbox/</code>)</li>
<li>longer term TODO lists like <em>WORK NEXT</em></li>
<li>notes for new project ideas</li>
<li>running notes for ongoing projects, like <em>eFoil project notes</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bigger ideas</h2>

<p>I like to read actively and synthesize what I read to try to create a deeper understanding. Some of these notes are half-formed ideas at best, others are taken in a hurry when I am away from a computer. Others aspire to <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen status</a>. </p>

<p>Anyway, let me describe more of the system in three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inputs: How do notes begin?</li>
<li>Synthesis: How are notes refined and intertwingled?</li>
<li>Output: What do notes turn into?</li>
</ol>

<h1>1. Inputs: how do notes begin?</h1>

<h2>On a computer</h2>

<p>On Desktop, I tend to have some time and can create a new note start-to-finish. I typically do this with Obsidian, which affords a nice editor and native support for traversal of wiki-style links.</p>

<p>I take meeting notes using Obsidian and store them separately (in <code>Meeting notes/</code>), and make random daily notes which get stored in a daily file such as <code>Inbox/2021-09-08.md</code>.</p>

<h2>On a mobile phone</h2>

<p>iA Writer supports iCloud Drive well and supports fast indexed, full-text search. Although it doesn't understand wiki-style links, it's a great way of quickly looking up a note, or appending to a specific list. For example, I'll often add a new word to my <em>Words I didn’t know well</em> when I encounter it for the first time.</p>

<h2>On the go</h2>

<p>Inspiration strikes at the most inconvenient times, often when I'm walking somewhere in nature. On iOS, I use a Siri Shortcut that I built to quickly dictate or type a semi-formed idea that may emerge on the go. Two slightly different shortcuts support both typing and dictation, and the result of either is to append the note text to the daily note (<code>Inbox/2021-09-08.md</code>). The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211781">Back Tap accessibility gesture</a> is quite a handy way of triggering this shortcut.</p>

<p>Siri Shortcuts are a bit more awkward on the Apple Watch, since it takes a surprising amount tapping to invoke. I've also attempted to take notes completely hands free using AirPods by saying "hey siri note" which invokes my awesome shortcut. However this is quite frustrating in practice. Dictating notes, I often take a short pause to gather my thoughts, which triggers the silence detector in this dictation mode, and truncates my input. I'd love to be able to explicitly to trigger the end of dictation while hands free. My preferred solution would be a "safe word". Hufflepuff!</p>

<h2>Reading articles</h2>

<p>My current article reading workflow is to funnel everything into Instapaper. I filter articles from friends, private groups on Discord, twitter, and general web browsing. If from a quick skim the article seems worthwhile, I'll cue up in Instapaper to calmly read at a later point.</p>

<p>I aspire to read actively, making heavy use of Instapaper's annotation features. These are synced up with <a href="https://readwise.io">https://readwise.io</a>. From there, a <em>Readwise to markdown script</em> runs daily, importing annotations into my note collection for easy referencing.</p>

<h2>While reading/listening to books</h2>

<p>Books feel more wholesome than articles, and afford me the luxury of delving more deeply into an area. Part of it is just that I can spend more time thinking about a single thing. This is both intrinsically pleasing, and can hopefully yield a more insightful synthesis. I typically keep a note for each book review, and append to it roughly while reading or listening to a book.</p>

<h1>2. Synthesis: how are notes refined?</h1>

<p>By synthesis I mean the collision of multiple concepts inside my note corpus into a new idea or insight. This process occurs naturally as I write and am reminded of something I have previously written. This is an iterative process, often done in multiple sittings. It resembles having a conversation with my past self, as ideas are clarified, integrated, and interlinked. </p>

<p>This is the core loop of note taking, and I'm still learning this skill. Most of what I know is from <em>How to Take Smart Notes by Sonke Ahrens</em>.</p>

<p>Tools can also catalyze synthesis. For example, in Obsidian, when typing a new internal link using the double bracket syntax, you are presented with a list of suggested notes based on title. This can sometimes remind me that I have another note that is relevant. Perhaps it should be linked, transcluded, or merged into this one. Notational Velocity was guite good at this, and Obsidian could do much more on this front.</p>

<p>Synthesis also happens when I triage rough daily notes taken on the go, and review highlights from articles. Reading through these half formed thoughts, I sometimes create a new note, or find an old note and append an elaboration.</p>

<p>I've also been experimenting with large language models for synthesis. Specifically, what happens if we take two randomly chosen notes, and then collide them using GPT3? I have a script that technically works but does not produce especially compelling results yet. Stay tuned.</p>

<h1>3. Outputs: what do notes turn into?</h1>

<h2>Manual book reviews</h2>

<p>Once I finish reading a book, I read through the notes I took, organize them lightly, and cross-link to existing notes. Then I store the completed book note in the <code>Book notes/</code> directory, and post it manually on smus.com/books.</p>

<h2>Automatic publishing</h2>

<p>I've started designating some notes as public by placing them in the <code>Public/</code> directory. A daily cron script automatically posts these notes to my new public note host, <a href="https://z3.ca">z3.ca</a>. </p>

<h2>Integration with spaced repetition</h2>

<p>I've made several attempts at trying to use spaced repetition for self-improvement purposes, and many have failed. However, one thing I'm still keen on is to use spaced repetition for improving my English vocabulary. I keep a list of new words I've encountered in a special note, and have tried using some spaced repetition apps to try to cram these. So far the habit has not stuck.</p>

<hr />

<p>I'm excited to see a rennaisance in the Tools for Thought space. Hopefully new
entrants embrace a more interoperable approach, while still building sustainable
businesses. But for now, I have kludged together various pieces that together
feel more like a coherent System for Thought, address my specific needs, and
allow for interesting experiments in the future.</p>

    <title>Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I really liked it. Author does a great job conveying little nuances of relationships. I feel similarly about past life and previous relationships that could have gone so differently. </p>

<p>At any rate it’s great writing and vivid character development. The love triangle is extremely strong. But the world building is pretty weak. How can the world of the "students" and the world of the rest of the population be so hermetic? They have full freedom to go anywhere, yet there is no interaction. On this topic, I find myself actively suspending disbelief.</p>

<p>As a teacher, I guess there are three possible scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hide the truth from clones, raise them like wolves, harvest their organs. (Ground truth universe)</li>
<li>Hide the truth from clone-students, give them a decent human childhood, harvest their organs. (Hailsham's approach)</li>
<li>Tell students the whole story which would deprive them of their childhood, but give them a chance to potentially empower them to change the system somehow. (Lucy's approach)</li>
</ol>

<p>I kept waiting for Tommy to attempt to change the system during his fourth donation. Ishiguro does some nice false foreshadowing, and when Tommy caves without a fight, the effect is one of resignation.</p>

<p>Systemic change is hard to achieve.</p>

<p>Everyone is born into some station and feels like they must do what it is they are born to do, rarely questioning or acting on their impulses. Tommy's river analogy comes to mind. People drift down this river of least resistance without much agency. If you were born as a student-clone, what would you do? Very likely, live the life allotted to you, in the best case that of a Hailsham student.</p>

<h1>We are in Hailsham</h1>

<p>The fact that the students can't have children of their own is the tragic part of this whole piece. In their lives, as in ours, death is guaranteed. In theirs, it becomes inevitable after the fourth donation, in ours after age 80 or 90. But the finality of death without children is such that all is lost. This is not really a well-developed theme in the book, more of a background take. Kathy makes it explicitly through the song.</p>

<p>I thought that Kazuo Ishiguro invented "Never Let Me Go" the song, and but it turns out that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UX6tzE7P44">the song is real</a>, the cover is real, and Judy Bridgewater is real. Honestly, this is disappointing. Previously, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nice use of the invented song, and vividly described. It serves as a really touching tearjerker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found the ending to be a little bit drawn out. For example I thought that the book would end at the scene where Tommy and Kathy go and talk to Madame. A lot of the stuff after that was a little bit less clear and might have just been possible to cut.</p>

    <title>Gardener &amp; Carpenter by Alison Gopnik</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/gardener-carpenter-by-alison-gopnik"/>
    
    <updated>2021-08-25T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/gardener-carpenter-by-alison-gopnik</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This one's been on my radar for years. I've read a lot of the author's articles and generally feel a strong affinity for Isaiah Berlin, whom Gopnik has done quite a bit to popularize. Self described as a Bubbie from Berkeley with a PhD in developmental neuroscience that sometimes dabbles in philosophy. </p>

<h1>Core idea</h1>

<p>The message promulgated in most parenting books is that raising kids is like carpentry: consider what material your dealing with, form a well specified blueprint, measure twice, cut once. Then you can judge how well you’ve done by the final result. </p>

<p>A parent’s goal should instead be to raise their child like resilient garden that can adapt to a dynamic world. Such a garden or maybe even wild meadow evolves and adapts to circumstances. This is in contrast to a much more static approach of growing hot house tomatoes. The hot house is highly regulated and creates ideal circumstances for the tomato to grow. But these ideal circumstances are not reflective of the real world. Hot house tomato’s are not resilient. </p>

<p>Reminds me a bit of legibility and <em>Seeing Like a State by James Scott</em> but applied to children. Authoritarian High modern failure mode in kids is one that tries to carpenter too much. I have examples of this in distant friends: MA rebelled against becoming a doctor, IN rebelled against becoming a software engineer. Both results were disappointing to their parents. Better to not be so prescriptive.</p>

<p>(Does this idea of parent-gardener break down if you consider a very large garden? I guess if garden is large enough you end up with parent-industrial farmer. Is that what school is then?)</p>

<h1>Against parentING</h1>

<p>I appreciated the more philosophical bent, especially as compared to other parenting books. But the narrative sometimes bent towards a pedantic but still an insightful critique of “parenting” especially as a goal driven activity. You don’t go around “friending” people, offspring are never “childing” you and your spouse is not usually “wifing” you. Gerunds have their place though. </p>

<p>Other relationships offer an interesting parallel: you don’t think you are a successful friend if they have become successful. Nor do you become a successful husband by profoundly improving your wife.</p>

<p>Many observations framed as paradoxes. Sounds more like tensions to me. Tensions between:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Formal education and play</strong>, which itself leads to education but in roundabout illegible ways. (Makes me think of my work and when I’m happiest. It’s when I’m playing. Building toys. Playing to learn. </li>
<li><strong>Explore vs exploit</strong>. Since childhood kids want to be independent but also seek out the comfort of their parents. The same is true over a lifecycle, going from profound dependence to the opposite extreme. Similar tensions around Tradition and innovation. More on this in <em>Explore vs exploit trade-offs</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fundamentally, <em>Open-endedness is required to solve ambitious problems</em>. Play and childhood are optimized for this.</p>

<h1>Recent changes parents and society</h1>

<p>Historically, humans live grown in large, multigenerational families. Most have the opportunity to help raise siblings Or cousins before becoming parents. Once parents, their kids are raised in large party but extended family. </p>

<p>Families growing smaller. More mobility. Having kids later in line after more education. Many new parents don’t have any expertise with kids at all. </p>

<p>“Parenting” builds on this gap in knowledge and caregivers. It’s profits from the expectation of educated people that things are learned through books. </p>

<h1>Analogy to dieting</h1>

<p>Referencing Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan. What was formerly a traditional way of being, like cooking meals from a certain cuisine, was replaced by a sort of science-inspired explosion of dieting advice. The more we deliberately cook and eat to become healthy, the less healthy we become.</p>

<p>The more we raise children to make them happy and successful adults the less happy and successful they become. <em>Trying not to try</em></p>

<p>The sheer quantity of parenting and dieting books itself is just an indication that none of them work. If one did, they’d all be out of business. This critique reminds me of the one in <em>Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization</em>. </p>

<h1>Generational compounding</h1>

<p>If a child is slightly better at using a tool, this advantage is slightly conferred to their offspring. And the effect compounds. Children's brains are the largest of all animals and our childhoods are the longest. Largely this is to have more time to develop and grow a brain, which is extremely plastic so that it can adapt maximally to its cultural milieu. </p>

<p>Birds are categorized as either precocial or altricial, depending on their capabilities at birth.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Precocious birds</strong> are capable of moving around on its own soon after hatching. They develop early and are pretty dumb. Examples: chickens, geese, and turkeys.</li>
<li><strong>Altricial birds</strong> are basically useless at birth. They hatch with eyes closed, fully depend on the parent, and cannot even leave the nest on their own. Examples: crows, herons, owls, and woodpeckers.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our minds can change rapidly… in just a few generations!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Evolution: why do women live past menopause?</h1>

<p>Most mammals die before they reach menopause.</p>

<p>Gopnik, a grandma herself, produces a strong argument in defense of grandmas. Post-menopausal grandmothers are evolutionarily advantageous because they allow their children to have more offspring despite the high maintenance and long childhood of each grandchild. By providing more childcare, the grandmother helps scale her genetic impact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don’t care about children because we love them. We love them because we care for them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a reinforcing feedback loop.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by this idea of <em>Catholic Age of Reason is 7</em>. Clearly the long childhood has become much longer in recent generations.</p>

<h1>Maybe against evo psych?</h1>

<p>Gopnik presents a convincing critique of evolutionary psychology. So much of being a human is embedded in our culture that it’s unclear that insights from the Pleistocene are applicable without lots of caveats. She also draws on the vast variety of behaviors exhibited by other primates. Gorillas are very aggressive and organize in harems, bonobos are very promiscuous and enjoy free love.</p>

<p>But then almost in the same breath, she proceeds to refer to a lot of evolutionary psychological studies, such as an interesting explanation of why post-menopausal women make sense from an evolutionary perspective.</p>

<h1>In favor of apprenticeships</h1>

<p>More evo-psych studies in which Gopnik makes an ultimate argument against schooling and in favor of the traditional master-apprentice model. There's a bunch of social psychology studies and half of them sound a little bit dubious. It's also often unclear how they relate to the thesis the book.</p>

<p>Young children naturally imitate adults, under certain conditions: that the adult seems to be confident, that they have a good track record of success, that the adult is not a robot, etc.</p>

<p>Kids also over-imitate, which is to say they will repeat additional actions of the adult even if they appear to be superfluous. Does this natural inclination of over-imitation explain rites that carry over almost verbatim l'dor v'dor? TRADITION!!</p>

<p>And so, argues Gopnik, imitation based learning is a super good foundation for the master-apprentice model. Lots of critiques of school a la <em>Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich</em>. There's also the historical argument, that the master-apprentice model is how people have learned for a long time.</p>

<p>Grad students are often professor apprentices, learning to write and getting critiqued.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For most of our history, children have started their internships at age 7, not 27”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Good argumentation techniques</h2>

<p>Gopnik describes a thought experiment in which baseball is taught as if it were part of the core school curriculum. Students would begin with history of the game, introduction to running, then dive deeply into ball and bat construction, and those that get accepted into a Masters in Baseball might get to play some softball in the last few months of their degree.</p>

<p>Great (apocryphal) story about the master swordsman who forced his pupil to cook his food. But would show up randomly in the kitchen and smack his apprentice with a wooden sword. After three years of this the apprentice became always vigilant. Full legend is <em>The Taste of Banzo's Sword</em></p>

<p>Effective passage on "the device", which is reads like a Tristan Harris-style attack on smartphones, social media, or insert<em>bogeyman</em>here. She then reveals that it's actually about books, which were similar criticized by Socrates. This is a good reminder about generational conservatism, and made me feel more inclined to pursue far future technology with questionable social implications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The day before you were born always looks like Eden, and the day after your children were born always looks like Mad Max.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Play is fundamental</h1>

<p>Interesting that children seem to seek out evidence that contradicts their theories as part of play. </p>

<p>Play must be spontaneous. The <em>Ms. Havisham Problem illustrates that play must be spontaneous</em> is a good framing of why, citing Dickens' book where a disgruntled old lady asks a child to play for her entertainment. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I am tired," said Miss Havisham. "I want diversion, and I have done with men and women. Play." I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Play must be spontaneous and is demonstrably more effective than teaching in some cases. Gopnik cites a study where children were either 1) shown how a multifunctional toy works, or 2) allowed to discover the functionality for themselves. Children shown how to play with a toy did not tend to discover other novel ways of playing with it while those that were allowed to explore ended up discovering more functionality. (Surely this depends on how much functionality was demonstrated in 1).</p>

<p>(Gopnik does not explicitly say this but I really like the idea that <em>Play is deliberate practice for wicked problems</em>)</p>

<h2>Why is play fun?</h2>

<p>Why is sex fun? Evolution made sex fun so that people and animals would do it and propagate our genes.</p>

<p>Why is play fun? Evolution made play fun so that people and animals would learn how to world works experientially. (All of this flies in the face of the earlier critique of evopsych?)</p>

<h1>A grab bag of ideas</h1>

<p>The books flows reasonably well, but some pieces feel more like a side show than a coherent part of the gardener vs carpenter thesis.</p>

<p>Gopnik makes a bunch of observations like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A study shows correlation between standardized testing and ADHD diagnosis. I guess this is vaguely a result of excessive carpentry?</li>
<li>Puberty apparently happens at a younger age today than historically? Super weird hypotheses, including Artificial light and Sedentary lifestyle.</li>
<li>Points to increases in absolute intelligence over time (IQ scores are set so that 100 is the average). This is the Flynn effect. Gopnik speculates that increasing IQ is in tension with finely honed and focused expertise.</li>
</ul>

<h1>My critique: consider ergodicity</h1>

<p>Most gardens have hundreds of plants growing in them. But your average kinder garden only has 2.5 kinders, and every parent wants to do everything in their power to help them thrive. Even in a garden with hundreds of plants, it's hard to really understand what works and what doesn't. With an N of O(1), you certainly don't want to experiment and risk failure. So people take the safe path, another example of <em>Cover Your Ass</em>.</p>

<p>This is my fundamental criticism of the Gardener model of parenting. In other words, I am identifying the core challenge to the parent. If Gopnik is indeed right, and the gardener model is the one to adopt, it is difficult for ambitious parents to do this in practice, because they are so invested in their child's future and be subject to competitive parenting, etc.</p>

        <p>An excellent ending to a worthwhile trilogy on Medieval History. Also see <a href="/books/early-middle-ages">Early
Middle Ages</a> and <a href="/books/high-middle-ages">High Middle
Ages</a>.</p>

<h1>Franks and Popes</h1>

<p>The papacy was not doing so hot in the late middle ages. Cardinals routinely failed to agree in the next pope. In one incident, a famous hermit criticized them harshly for being so petty and squabbling. In response the cardinals decided to appoint him as pope Celestine V. He held the position reluctantly and then decreed in a papal bull that popes can resign, and promptly did so. His power hungry successor Boniface VIII imprisoned him to prevent his potential return, and Celestine V died in prison.</p>

<p>Phillip the Fair (Phillip IV), king of France around the 13th century, had a falling out with the pope reminiscent of the Teutonic rulers of prior centuries. The difference here is rather than succumbing to papal power he thwarted it successfully so that future popes knew not to mess with French kings. After threatening to excommunicate Philip IV and issuing a papal bull suggesting explicitly that popes trumped kings, Philip IV's royal troops captured Pope Boniface VIII, imprisoned him, beat him badly. The Boniface VIII died a month later and his successor Clement V was pressured to move the papacy to France.</p>

<p>Crusaders that remained in the holy lands after the crusades formed Crusader States. One such order, The Knights Templar defended Christian Jerusalem from Arab reconquest. They were monk-knights who helped other crusaders. The Knights Templar grew rich from donations from Christians who wanted to keep the holy city in their grasp. They grew unpopular after losing Jerusalem to Saladin and amassing great wealth. </p>

<p>Phil IV decided to pursue the Templar order, prosecution was also likely a money grab. He also expelled the Jews and annexed their property. <em>Expelling Jews is historically a great way for kings to get rich quick</em>. The pope initially condemned the mass Templar arrest but then when they confessed under torture, the pope called for other European kings to also arrest their Templars under papal authority. Papal palaces we’re built in Avignon. Subsequent popes were selected from the population of southern France. </p>

<h2>Papal Schism</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, pressure mounted for the Papacy to return to Rome. Popes were the spiritual successors of St. Paul, bishop of Rome. If they weren't in Rome that legacy was undermined. Urban VI was then selected under pressure from Roman citizens who rioted in demand of an Italian pope. The cardinals presented the masses with a pope of Italian origin but years later the French cardinals reneged and appointed another pope, Clement VII. He ruled in Avignon. As a result, there were two active popes at this time, and this period is referred to as the Western Schism aka Papal Schism (not to be confused with the East-West Schism aka Great Schism). </p>

<p>France and it’s allies like Scotland were generally in favor of the pope in Avignon. But sometimes there was a split in a single city and there were two bishops, each loyal to the French and Italian pope respectively. </p>

<p>It was thought that once one of the popes died, the population would support the other and the schism would end. But when urban VI died, his followers appointed another successor in Rome. And then when Clement VII died, his followers appointed a new pope in Avignon. </p>

<h2>Conciliarism reform movement</h2>

<p>In response to this shitshow, the Conciliarism reform movement began. A high level church councils composed of bishops and other Catholic leaders met and passed judgement apart from, or potentially against, the pope. The council of Pisa in 1408 was organized by a few breakout bishops from both French and Italian sides. They hoped to appoint a new pope and depose the two existing ones. The appointed pope died a year later and was replaced by John XXIII, who was odious and widely hated. So now there were three popes.</p>

<p>The council at Constance succeeded in deposing John 23 for moral reasons. The pope in Rome was also convinced to step down. The council finally deposed the pope in France. The papal schism finally ended in 1407 when the Cardinals elected Martin V. </p>

<p>What followed was a disagreement between those in favor of church councils and those in favor of the old system. Subsequent councils were not well attended, little reason to do so since the schism had ended. Still council at Basel imposed a bunch of limitations on the church. They made a limit of 24 cardinals, no more than 8 from each country, and constrained the amount of money the papacy could collect from local churches.</p>

<p>(My synthesis of this is that overall, these turbulent times paved the way for the protestant reformation.)</p>

<h1>Hundred Years War</h1>

<p>The hundred year war was a long conflict, not a constant total war, but a series of skirmishes. Britain decisively won the important battles early on. (Lots of overlap with <em>The Story of Medieval England</em>). Joan of Arc had a decisive part to play, just when France was all but defeated and almost entirely under British control managed to incite a last ditch effort to reconquer. </p>

<p>One of the most violent years during the war was one in which there was no fighting between sides after the treaty of Brétigny in 1360. Mercenary armies hired by the warring kings began indiscriminately pillage for want of supplies. The result was chaos, death, and destruction. To remedy this failure mode, salaried standing armies were introduced around 1450. This was expensive but cheaper than the alternative. It also greatly strengthened royal power compared to that of the nobles since now the crown could rely more on a paid army rather than the decentralized feudal system or lords and vassals. 
This was the first Christian standing army since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>

<h2>Critical invention: The Longbow</h2>

<p>The English first encountered the longbow in their wars with the Welsh. English Longbows emerged by the 100 years war contributed to their prowess against the French who relied heavily on knights. The original short bow didn't require much training to use, but packed almost no punch against a knight. Crossbows were then invented as an effective ranged weapon against knights but suffered from a slow firing rate. You could speed it up a bit by lying prone but doing this in the face of a charging knight was not prudent. </p>

<p>The Longbow took the best of both worlds: the force of its blow could penetrate armor and it didn't take ages to reload. This weapon gave the English their decisive victories against the French knight armies at Crécy, Poitiers and Agincourt. </p>

<p>The longbow wielded by hundreds of archers was a very effective way to deal with knights. And although unlike short bows, it requires training, fighting as a longbowman was far cheaper and easier than fighting as a knight. Now the peasant class had once again a reason to fight, and gain some leverage over the noble fighting classes.</p>

<p>The Hundred Years War and “Babylonian captivity” of the church in France occurred simultaneously, as did the Black Death. </p>

<h1>The Black Death</h1>

<p>Likely Bubonic Plague. 1347-1351 was period of greatest mortality.  Killed potentially 50% of people in Europe at the time. It came from the east via Italy, the main connection point to the Orient. Earlier and more southerly parts of Europe were the most affected, in some cases 75% of the population dying.</p>

<p>There wasn't a good understanding about the underlying reason for the plague at all, so other reasons were sought. As usual, Jews were blamed for the plague, leading to increased pogroms around this same era. </p>

<p>Around 1340 was a local maximum in European population. These levels were not seen again until the 17th century. Outbreaks of the plague still occurred, but became rarer and rarer. </p>

<p>!<em>Population of Europe 1300-1800.png</em></p>

<p>Because of the huge depopulation, things looked quite different economically. Suddenly there was a labor shortage. Wages shot up 3-5x. Cost of food had decreased due to a reduction in demand. Land prices went down too. Wage laborers began to enjoy a very high standard of living. </p>

<p>Economically speaking, this was great news for the surviving poor, but bad news for the nobles. A variety of attempts were made by nobles to curtail these negative economic effects. Some tried to fix wages by law, which largely failed to overpower strong market forces. Others tried to bring back serfdom, effectively bringing back free labor. This was counter to the interests of the crown since serfs were in the jurisdiction of their lord, including for tax and legal reasons. This was resisted in the west, but for some reason in the east of Europe serfdom came back with a vengeance and lasted well into the 19th century, with second order effects into modernity. </p>

<h1>Freedom in East and West Europe</h1>

<p>In the early Middle Ages, Eastern Europe was the European frontier. Lords of the east could entice western serfs to move and settle in their domains in exchange for freedom. Thus early in the Middle Ages, the east had more free smallholders than the west. </p>

<p>After the plague, the dynamics shifted substantially. Western countries with historically stronger kings were not interested in supporting serfs, who would only strengthen nobles, paying tax to them and being subject to their courts. </p>

<p>Also, empowered peasantry in the west staged successful rebellions (The Jacquerie in France, English Peasant Revolt) against nobles that attempted to revive serfdom. England was especially ahead of the game in terms of personal liberties for the masses. After the Normal conquest, William the Conqueror and his line established unprecedentedly strong and centralized control over England. The Baronial revolts and early Magna Carta set the stage for more personal liberties, and a rule of law. The island had time to develop independently due to its distance from mainland Europe.</p>

<p>In the east however, a feudal, more distributed system controlled by nobles and weaker rulers meant that serfdom could be brought back in force. Toward the late Middle Ages, many peasants in the east were newly serfs, and very few in the west. Russian serfdom lasted well into the mid 19th century. </p>

<p>Feudalism is distributed and leads to bad outcomes for the masses. In general this is a good example of distributed not being always better than centralized from a consequential standpoint. </p>

<h1>Gone are the days of the knights</h1>

<h2>Pikes</h2>

<p>Infantry was becoming increasingly effective against knights around the 13th century. In Flanders, a knight army could be thwarted by to opening up water gates and flooding the whole plain. In the Scottish mountains, knights did not have a flat area from which to charge. More generally, effective anti-knight tactics were developed around this time:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traps</strong>: Infantry would dig ditches, fill them with spikes and cover them with leaves. </li>
<li><strong>Pikemen</strong>: pikes were longer than lances, so would impale a knight before they would impale the pikeman. Armies of pikemen would dig their pike's dull ends into the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Halberds</strong>: The Swiss developed the halberd, a spear with an axe and hook. You could use it as a pike, and/or use the hook to pull the knight off his horse, and/or split him in twain with the axe. It’s sort of a Swiss Army knife, so to speak. The halberd could also be used offensively in phalanx-like formations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cannons</h2>

<p>Gunpowder was developed initially in China, where it was used as a shock weapon. Early European cannons were also useful only for shock tactics as well, being very loud and scary to those that heard it in the battlefield. But they were not at all effective at hitting their targets, and accidents often resulted in the death of the canon crew. Still, the Europeans were more persistent and continuously refined the cannon to eventually make a very effective siege weapon.</p>

<p>The development of the canon with especially devastating for knights and other lords since it meant that their castle at home was no longer as impregnable.</p>

<p>Each cannon was initially given a name, much like Trebuchets, one named Malvoisin ("bad neighbor"). It's interesting what war equipment is given names, and which is not. Trebuchets, early Cannons. Ships are always named. Why aren't planes? What about tanks?</p>

<p>At the start of the hundred years war, cannonballs were made out of large stone boulders. These were rounded out by hand, and inevitably ended up with irregularities which would greatly reduce accuracy. Even if the stone cannonball hit the wall, it would shatter on impact. Around 1430, stone cannonballs were replaced with cast iron cannonballs which were much more spherical and much  more devastating on impact.</p>

<p>Castle design reacted to the invention of cannon. Walls became lower and thicker. Square towers rounded out and became cylindrical. Towers became the same height as walls, to allow artillery on the walls to more easily move into position. </p>

<h2>Arquebusiers and musketeers</h2>

<p>Personal firearms were less effective than cannons during the middle ages. The earliest resembled broomsticks with a small cannon on the end. The arquebus was developed in the early 15th century and it was a functional precursor to the musket. This weapon proved effective against knights at the Battle of Pavia, just like the longbow at Agincourt. </p>

<p>The combination of pikemen and musketeers was an especially formidable force against knights. Knights really hated Musketeers especially (nice backstory on the whole Three Musketeers plot). Even heavier plate mail was developed to try to defend against musket balls. Some inroads were made, but ultimately these full-plate suits were so heavy that they were impractical. </p>

<hr />

<p>As a result of so many forces working against nobles, many are forced to take paid employment, either at the court of a more powerful noble or at the court of the king. This marks the rise of courtiers. This cultural shift replaces the ideal of the chivalric knight. Now, nobles are expected not to ride a horse and save ladies, but to be nonchalant royal advisors capable of performing music and reciting poetry. Presumably all while still fulfilling duties of their job for which they were hired?</p>

<h1>Printing press and related inventions</h1>

<p>Although the printing press is by far the sexiest invention required for broader production of printed books, other breakthroughs were required in writing materials, advances in script, and book style. Daileader does a good job emphasizing this.</p>

<h2>Papyrus-parchment-paper</h2>

<p>Papyrus was the earliest writing material, made of a water plant that grows in abundance in the Nile river delta in Egypt. It emerged around 3000 BCE and the Egyptians controlled it fully. </p>

<p>Parchment is another writing material made of animal skins. It may have emerged as early as 1500 BCE, but is named after the King of Pergamum (пергамент) in Asia Minor around 100 BCE. It was developed in response to the cessation of Egyptian papyrus exports. The process was of making parchment was quite intense, requiring animal skins to be stretched over a frame, cleaned fully of fat, then dried. The rougher exterior side of the skin could serve as a book cover. The whiter interior was used to write on. </p>

<p>Parchment was expensive to produce, and as a result was often reused. Old scrolls would just be cleaned up, with ink removed, and then use it again to create anew. Vellum was a fancier, whiter variant of parchment. The highest grade required killing a pregnant sheep and her unborn calf, and then creating the parchment from the calf's skin (aka Chickenskin).</p>

<p>Towards the late middle ages, paper production was imported from China. This was much cheaper than parchment and the necessary condition for democratizing books.</p>

<h2>Advances in script</h2>

<p><em>Carolingian minuscule</em> was commonly used around the time of the early middle ages. One problem with this script was that it was quite rounded and laborious for scribes to produce by hand. So scribes created a more efficient writing style called now called Gothic script. This had the benefit of being mostly vertical, so easieir to write because of a predominantly unidirectional motion of the arm. An added benefit was that the script was more compact, so more text would fit on one page.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, handwritten script with ligatures was revived from classical antiquity. Later, in an attempt to disavow of anything middle age related, scholars shunned gothic script and reverted back to minuscule, not realizing that it too was a middle age invention (c. 9th century)</p>

<h2>Book style</h2>

<p>During the early Middle Ages books were extremely large and heavy, requiring a pedestal to support. Books tended to get smaller over time, some were soon small enough to fit into a pocket. </p>

<p>Further inventions in readability were introduced: indices, tables of contents.</p>

<h2>Printing press precursors</h2>

<p>Woodcut prints allowed the artist to create multiple copies of his artwork. This required more effort than simply sketching with ink and paper, since the work needed to be etched into wood. But then once the wooden etching was created, you could create hundreds or thousands of impressions. The problem with wood was that it wore out overtime. Handcrafted metal blocks were also attempted, and this was obviously even harder than making a wood block.</p>

<p>Another challenge with wood blocks was that the stamped image would sometimes be unevenly produced, either because part of the wooden block had deteriorated, or there was some uneven application of ink, or uneven pressure. Furthermore, doing two-sided prints of woodblocks was impossible using this technique, since producing the imprint on one side would create an extrusion on the other side.</p>

<h2>The printing press</h2>

<p>Gutenberg's printing press combined two prior inventions: the wine press for evenly transferring ink from source to target, and movable metal type. A printer would typeset a whole page, make many copies of it, then move on to the next page. The end result were many copies of a printed book.</p>

<p>Metal typesetting was known in Asia, but never combined with wine style presses. Compared to Asia, Europe had other important advantages: </p>

<ul>
<li>European alphabets are phonetic and have fewer than 30 symbols. In contrast, Asian alphabets are mostly ideographical and have thousands of symbols. </li>
<li>Chinese printing presses were state run, and as a result mostly Confucian classics were produced. In Europe the printing press was subject to the free market, and thrived.</li>
</ul>

<p>Second order impacts of the printing press were huge:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spread of knowledge in general. Nuff said!</li>
<li>Errata could be issued in bulk, since many books were now identical and issued in editions. </li>
<li>Ossification of English spelling. Previously spelling was pretty variable. This is especially annoying since the great vowel shift followed shortly thereafter, rendering English spellings nonsensical. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Humanism in Late Medieval Europe</h1>

<p>The humanist movement arose in 14th century Italy as part of the Italian Renaissance. Humanists aimed for a revival of classical art and literature, and following Petrarch, viewed the preceding centuries as a dark and lost age of regression. (Interesting to see how the “first industrial revolution” from <em>Medieval Technology and Social Change</em> framing conflicts with this). They were headquartered largely in Florence where the recently founded university had not yet been fully oriented toward the scholastic tradition which was ubiquitous everywhere else. Florence at the time was extremely rich, minting the Florin, the first gold coin Europe had seen in almost a millennium.</p>

<p>Unlike medieval artists and authors, humanists signed their work and strive for a sort of secular immortality by living on in the minds of their peers after their inevitable death. That said, humanists were still deeply entrenched in the Christian tradition. This was not yet the enlightenment, nor the reformation, nor the scientific revolution.</p>

<h1>Christians and Muslim conflicts in the late middle ages</h1>

<p>The Byzantine empire stood valiantly for a millennium longer than its western roman counterpart. Its land holdings empire ebbed and flowed from assailants from all around, sometimes shrinking to little more than Constantinople itself. By the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks finally conquered the impregnable city of Constantinople and officially ended the Byzantine empire. </p>

<p>This was seen as a huge loss, especially from a humanist lens. The whole Greek trove of knowledge was lost to Christendom for eternity! In practice, by then much of this trove of classical Greek culture had been assimilated by the west, through translation, and through a revival of Greek language, hearkening back to classical antiquity, when Roman elites were fluent in both Latin and Greek.</p>

<p>With the fall of the Byzantine empire, Europe was bracing for more incursions from their aggressive and powerful Turkish neighbors. Sure enough, the Ottomans even managed to conquer and briefly hold small parts of Italy. So it was welcome news that in Iberia, the kingdoms of Aragon and Castille had formed an alliance with the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, and they had set out to conquer Granada, the last Islamic state in the west. This was a culmination of many centuries of European reconquest of Al-Andalus, the Ummayad kingdom that formed from the ashes of the Visigoths, defeated in the 8th century. Spain was once a cultural melange of three religions, but F&amp;I were keen to homogenize their joint kingdom. </p>

<h1>The Spanish Inquisition</h1>

<p>Shortly after the defeat of Granada, jubilant Ferdinand and Isabella decided to kick it up a notch and the Spanish Inquisition swung into full force. Spain had previously not participated in the papal inquisition, and unlike the previous inquisitions which relied on inquisitors reporting to the pope, the Spanish inquisition was operated by the king and queen. </p>

<p>It's somewhat unclear why F&amp;I decided to force all Jews to convert or leave. Ferdinand had recently appointed Jewish courtiers whose contract was not due to expire for years. The reason given was that there were too many Christians converting to Judaism in Spain. In practice, anti-Jewish sentiment had been rising for decades, thanks to preachers like Ferrand Martinez, and the massacre in 1391 which led to 50,000 Jewish deaths and far more forced conversions.</p>

<p>In 1492, every Jew in Spain was given a choice: convert or leave. Those that converted to Christianity were called conversos. Some conversos even managed to secure bishoprics, but many were treated with suspicion by the masses, who suspected that many conversos continued to practice the Jewish faith in secret. Thus even if you converted from Judaism, you were still somehow Jewish, and this is the origin of Jewishness as a race, which permeates into modernity and foreshadows Jewish horrors of the 20th century. Furthermore, now that conversos were Christian, they were subject to the inquisition, and those that were found guilty of heresy were burnt alive.</p>

<h1>Maritime technology in Iberia</h1>

<p>Back to technology: navigation and sailing ships, in the context of Iberian expansion and the age of exploration. The Iberian peninsula at the time was not split between Spain and Portugal, but between several rival kingdoms: Kingdom of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre, and the Kingdom of Portugal.</p>

<h2>The Caravel</h2>

<p>Shipbuilding technology was fairly stagnant until the 15th century. Here are a few common ship types before this period:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Longships</strong>, aka galleys were powered by teams of rowers. They had to be light so that the men could propel it and it had to be long enough so enough men could fit inside. Because of the large crew, their provisions, and other constraints, these ships could not carry much cargo. Longships were short range and only used on the Mediterranean. Some longships had sails that would be raised in favorable downwinding conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Roundships</strong> often had a single mast with a square rigged single sail. They were large and bulky and slow, but could carry a lot of cargo. The square rigged sail meant you would mainly use the sail to go downwind, greatly limiting maneuverability. </li>
<li><strong>Lateen</strong> sailboats originated in the Nile, but were later used in the Mediterranean. These triangular sails could luff and generate lift using the sail as a wing, and move the vessel towards the wind. Lateen sails of the 14th century also tended to be quite small, so were not very effective.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of its geography, the Iberian kingdoms had exposure to both north Atlantic roundships, and ships with Lateen sails commonly used in the Mediterranean. The Caravel, invented by the Portuguese in the 15th century, combined both types of sails. Early designs had a front square rigged sail, and a rear lateen sail, allowing ships to zig-zag upwind, or run downwind depending on wind conditions.</p>

<h2>Other Iberian advantages</h2>

<p>The Iberian peninsula was extremely well situated geographically, in the far southwest of Europe, and thus the natural portal to west Africa. Furthermore, the Spanish had a great history of seafaring already and were notoriously brave sailors, willing to venture further than others in pursuit of fish and whales. Lastly, some of the best mapmakers of the age were based on the Balearic islands (Ibiza, Mallorca, Menorca).</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Portugal had the early upper hand. Portuguese Caravels were slowly traveling further and further south down the West African coast. Thanks to the funding efforts of Prince Henry the navigator, Vasco da Gamma finally reached the Cape of Good Hope. Meanwhile, F&amp;I were spending most of their disposable income on conquering Granada for the new Spanish alliance. </p>

<p>Portugal established footholds in many parts strategically located in Africa and far beyond. Distant ports included Goa off the coast of India, Macao off China, many of which remain to this day Portuguese territories. F&amp;I had attempted to loosen the Portuguese monopoly on the world, they were ultimately unsuccessful and in 1480 Ferdinand and Isabella granted a official monopoly to Portugal over a train with west Africa. Portuguese caravels were militarily superior and were very quickly able to destroy Arab fleets that previously controlled trade in the Indian ocean. The Portuguese king assumed a lofty title: Lord of the conquest and navigation of the ocean in India, Arabia, and Persia. </p>

<p>The Canary Islands were a bit of a revelation for Europeans that discovered them a new world that wasn't yet known to them, yet populated by people! Castilians first conquered the island and enslaved the local Guanches, the indigenous people of the islands. They died in huge quantities from the diseases the Europeans brought with them. Instead, the Spanish had to rely on imported west African slaves to run the plantations there. Why weren't west Africans subject to European diseases? Mainly because the cross-pollination between Europe and Africa. The European treatment of the Canaries established the model for colonization and served as a base for Columbus to venture further west. </p>

<p>Madeira and the Azores were uninhabited and discovered shortly after the Canaries. West African slaves were quickly imported there to establish the Sugar plantations as well as the Portuguese Madeira industry.</p>

<h1>The Columbian exchange</h1>

<p>Columbus had failed to convince the Portuguese king to fund his voyage, so pursued funding from Ferdinand and Isabella. The Catholic Monarchs were busy vanquishing the last remnants of Granada, it was taking longer than expected, and cost a fortune. They kept him on retainer for seven years, and only then committed to Columbus' voyage. Once he discovered what he called Asia but what was actually the New World, it was unclear who would own the territory. </p>

<p>Prior to the European discovery of America, The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the newly-discovered lands outside Europe between the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire (Crown of Castile), along an arbitrary meridian set by the Pope. This line happened to miss North America but cut South America in half, and explains why Brazil became a Portuguese territory (!).</p>

<p>One way to look at Columbus' discovery is as a large ecological event, in which previously diversifying and independent ecosystems  suddenly merged. If this is not the start of the Anthropocene, what is?</p>

<h2>Euro-American trade imbalances</h2>

<p><strong>Plants</strong>: a pretty good balance trade balance. Many critical crops from the New World corn and potato proved to be extremely important back in Europe. Other delicious new world plants included tomatoes, pineapples, peanuts, kidney beans, cashews, squash, sweet potatoes, avocado, chili pepper. And also druuuugs like coca and tobacco. And don't forget hammocks!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the New World saw a lot of new and critical crops from the east: sugar cane, bananas, coffee, wine grapes. Also onions, radish, and dandelions.</p>

<p><strong>Diseases</strong>: a big imbalance in favor of Europe. America had syphilis, and that's pretty much it. But the old world had loads of new diseases for the Americans, decimating their population. </p>

<p><strong>Animals</strong> a big imbalance in favor of Europe. America had very few pack animals: no cattle, pigs, sheep, or horses. Americans mainly had Turkeys and Llamas.</p>

<h1>End of Middle Ages</h1>

<p>Scholars can’t decide if 14th and 15th centuries are Middle Ages or renaissance. If you go to Italy at this period it’s the renaissance, otherwise it's the Middle Ages. One way to think about where to draw the line is what sort of things one could expect in the middle ages. Here are a few:</p>

<h2>Characteristics of the Middle Ages</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hereditary kings.</li>
<li>Elites are nobles, basis in landowning and military dominance.</li>
<li>Small scale production in the home, commerce dominated by guilds designed to keep production low.</li>
<li>Bottom of society are serfs, liberties constrained.</li>
<li>Belief in god is universal, and the basis of all intellectual life. </li>
<li>Reverence for the past and skepticism for thinking from first principles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this list, the Middle Ages continues well into the 16th century. Italian Humanists were trying to make a break from the past, but did nothing to eliminate nobility or serfdom, improve quality of life, or reform the guild system. </p>

<p>Daileader proposes a better potential endpoints to the Middle Ages, like the Scientific Revolution or the Protestant Reformation. But even these periods were rooted in the Middle Ages. Luther was a scholastic scholar following Aquinas' tradition. Newton was deeply religious. Perhaps an even better endpoint for the Middle Ages actually is the Enlightenment in the mid-18th century. The French Revolution was the antithesis to the Middle Ages and ushered in the drastic and abrupt end to many of the institutions central to the Middle Ages. (That said, the lecturer is a professor of Middle Age History, and is biased towards stretching the start and endpoints of his period of study.)</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I'm clearly on a serious history of the Middle Ages kick. I found this book by just searching the internet inspired by earlier courses on Medieval history, and didn't really know what I was getting into. Apparently it's really famous and influential among Medieval scholars, even causing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stirrup_Controversy">Great Stirrup Controversy</a>.</p>

<p>This book was clearly written for academics. Latin and French quotes remain
untranslated, even in footnotes and endnotes. Yet somehow despite this, it is
engaging and readable.</p>

<p>It's great fun to try to integrate viewpoints on the same topic (Middle Age
Technology) and begin to start to fill in the gaps. One great benefit of
focusing on the Middle Ages is that there wasn't as much technology to speak of.
This helps focus in on fewer things, and constraints are good.</p>

<h1>History of Horses in Combat</h1>

<ol>
<li>Horse chariots, in which a two wheeled cart is used as a moving platform for combat.</li>
<li>Mounted archers and light combat on horseback.</li>
<li>Knights, using combined weight of horse, rider and armor.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Charles and the Knights</h1>

<p>Charles Martel and his descendants saw the potential of using horses for mounted shock combat. (White seems to ignore high backed saddles and the couched lance technique, with a shocking emphasis on stirrups.) Using armies of knights, Martel the Hammer defeated the Arabs and retook many lands, rebuilding a shorter lived spiritual successor to the Roman empire. With knights proving so effective, there was a need for more knights. This led to a vast proliferation of feudalism, enabling new upwardly mobile vassals to gain access to lands required of a knight, and ultimately cemented this new style of warfare. By 1000, the Latin "miles", which had meant soldier, began to mean knight. </p>

<p>White has a great discussion about the “diffusion” of stirrups. In general this lens of <em>Diffusion of Technology</em> is one to keep in mind. I've adopted it in my random walk into <em>Age Heaping Using Canadian 1852 Census data</em>. As White eloquently puts it,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As our understanding of technology increases, it becomes clear that a new device merely opens a door; it does not compel one to enter. The acceptance or rejection of an invention, or the extent to which its implications are realized if it is accepted depends quite as much upon the condition of a society, and upon the imagination of its leaders, as upon the nature of the technological item itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Second order effects and unintended consequences</em> of this shift were massive. Horses were expensive to buy and maintain, armor was becoming heavier to be effective against lances with the force of thousands of pounds at its tip. Equipment for one knight seemed to cost about 20 oxen (a peasant family relied on 2). Knights often had squires, and multiple spare horses.</p>

<p>Charlemagne and other Carolingian kings encouraged peasants to band together and choose one of them to fight as a knight. Since land was the source of power of the time (money was not as key), the landed knights became the nouveau riche, creating a large gulf between them and the peasantry from which many of them came.</p>

<p>The old Germanic (nit: wasn't it the case in Rome too?) idea that every freeman was a soldier was now replaced by a professional fighting class.</p>

<p>Because of all the armor, knights became virtually unrecognizable and needed to develop some visual identification, and thus tradition of heraldry was born.</p>

<p>The cross bow emerged, either revived, or borrowed from the Chinese to penetrate knight's armor.</p>

<h1>Farming Practices</h1>

<p>Cross plowing was a technique to till tougher northern soil with a scratch plow. Furrows were made horizontally and vertically. This led to square fields. The moldboard plow, also known as the heavy plow eliminated the need for cross plowing because single furrows were deep enough for northern lands. It was also far more efficient. This made the fields long and narrow. (White does not mention the other reason for long fields: that ox teams were hard to turn.)</p>

<p>The heavy plow was wheeled and required an eight ox team. This required collaboration between peasants and led to closer ties and village councils. Large fields collectively owned were doled out to villagers in sequence. In contrast, southerners using scratch plows remained individualistic. </p>

<p>Diffusion of this technology was difficult and required a large population density. Another challenge was that collaboration was required between peasants to join plots together for this new farming practice. </p>

<p>Nailed Horseshoes were another key invention for agriculture. In Italy the warm climate worked well for unclod horses. But in the north, the climate and soil was such that horse hooves would often break. </p>

<p>The need for horses to carry more weight (armored knights) led to selective breeding of destriers. These stronger horses inevitably interbred with peasant farm horses, leading to stronger offspring. </p>

<p>Horses with padded collars could exert as much force as oxen. But moved much faster, so could output a lot more power. More speed let to more harrowing which was more effective at breaking up clods.</p>

<p>Yet the ox did not spread as quickly in England as one might expect. White suggests that this may have been because of a reluctance due to a lack of skin in the game, related to <em>Does your output affect your paycheck?</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the real reason for his favoring the ox at the plow emerges when he remarks that 'the malice of the ploughmen does not permit a horse-drawn plough to go any faster than one pulled by oxen'. This kind of slow-down may have affected the ploughing of demesne lands done reluctantly under manorial obligation but it would not apply when peasants were working their own fields.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other benefit of switching to horses was that they could be used as transport. During Roman times, cost of goods doubled every 100 mi of overland transport. This meant that viable farmland was situated only along rivers. During Roman times, most vehicles were two-wheeled. The first horse-drawn four-wheeled wagons appeared by 13th century and reduced overland cost so much that transport over 100 miles increased by just 30% (a 70% savings). This expanded viable farmland further from rivers, allowed a lot more farmland, and increased overall carrying capacity.</p>

<p>Wagon inventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pivoted front axles</li>
<li>Adequate brakes</li>
<li>Whipple trees</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the horse, peasants didn't need to rely entirely on merchants, but could get their goods to market on their own.</p>

<p>Horses also gave them more mobility, and many were able to move to form larger settlements and benefit from amenities there: the commune, a church, a tavern, more suitors, markets, etc. Horse as transport enabled them to commute to their fields daily.</p>

<p>(This is all so interesting from the perspective of complex systems and feedback
loops...)</p>

<h2>Three field rotation</h2>

<p>First recorded in 763, this practice became ubiquitous by 800 (shockingly fast). Previously, Europe had practiced the two field rotation invented by Romans. The old system alternated two halves, with one planted, the other left fallow. </p>

<p>The three field system split holdings into three sub-fields. The peasant planted winter crops (winter wheat or rye) on field 1, then summer crops (oats, barley, lentil, etc) on field 2, and left field 3 fallow. Next year, fields do a circular shift. </p>

<p>This had many advantages over the two field rotation:</p>

<ul>
<li>2/3 land utilization during the year (vs. 1/2).</li>
<li>More crop variety means more resiliency to droughts.</li>
<li>Better yields since legumes fix the nitrogen in the soil.</li>
<li>Oats for horses! Oats are much more nutritionally rich than grass, allowing many more horses to work in agriculture. </li>
<li>A more even workload for farmers throughout the year.</li>
<li>Legumes provided extra nutrition for protein starved peasantry.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Mechanical power</h1>

<p>Mechanical power experiments were done in antiquity - e.g. with Hero's Aeolipile, a proto-steam engine. But inventions like these did not get refined and was never put to use at scale until the middle ages.</p>

<p>(Not mentioned in White's book, but it appears that labor was very cheap in the early middle ages, with agricultural slaves being common. Towards the high middle ages, slaves are replaced by serfs, and are then set free to work as smallholder farmers. The cost of labor goes up further after the population is decimated by the Black Death. All of this drives the demand for cheap power.)</p>

<h2>Water power</h2>

<p>Water mills became common around the 11th century. By this point the Vitruvian design had won out: a vertical wheel that turned a horizontal shaft. Earlier designs used a horizontal wheel and a vertical shaft, but did not require gears. Domesday reported that 5000 water wheels were in place for 3000 villages, circa 1086. Tidal wheels were also used, with some early examples on the Adriatic.</p>

<h2>Wind power</h2>

<p>Wind power was originally harnessed in Tibet and China where mantras written on scrolls were placed on bookshelves which rotated by power of wind to increase their holiness. Windmills in Europe spread quickly. They could produce less power than water mills, but do not require a strong river flow. Also, they are immune to rivers freezing in winter or drying up in fall.</p>

<p>Applications of this mechanical power included mostly milling grain but also filling cloth, sawing wood, crushing olives, operating bellows for blast furnaces, turning grindstones to polish metal, mincing paper pulp. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The late Middle Ages has indeed been described as a “medieval industrial revolution based on water and wind.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting aside is that the Aelopile did have a direct application in the Middle Ages: a blower to keep fires oxygenated and burning more evenly called a sufflator.</p>

<h2>Pneumatic weapons</h2>

<p>Other pneumatic devices may have been inspired by a blowgun from Malay. This design was apparently appropriated by Arabs and eventually made its way to Europe around the middle ages. If you continue the logical chain, the idea of having a barrel and a projectile means that the simple blowgun was a precursor to the musket, as well as the steam engine. Succinctly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cannon is not only important in itself as a power-machine applied to warfare: it is a one-cylinder internal combustion engine, and all of our more modern motors of this type are descended from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corned gunpowder was a major refinement I’d not heard of. http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2016/07/black-powder-vii-corned-powder.html?m=1</p>

<h2>Gravity-based weapons</h2>

<p>Gravity based mechanical machines. The trebuchet emerged sometime in 11th (?) century and greatly improved on the Roman catapults, able to hurl 300 lb stone 300 yards using a long 50 ft lever arm and a heavy counterweight. Massive improvement over the Roman stars, 60 lb stone 450 yards. In siege warfare the mass of projectile matters most. </p>

<h1>Mechanisms and mechanical engineering</h1>

<p>Cranks… not sure why this section feels so dull right now. This reader struggled through a long discussion about cranks and when they were invented. Apparently not until 10th century or so in Europe. </p>

<p>Okay but seriously, cranks are important as a precursor to the pistons and in general the conversion of reciprocating motion into rotation or vice versa. If the driving force is reciprocation, you end up with a significant dead zone to get through. This is solved with a compound crank (as in a two stroke engine) and aided by Flywheels, which don’t appear until 14th century. Tangentially related, I really enjoyed <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/internal-combustion-engine/">this marvelous interactive explanation on the internal combustion engine</a>.</p>

<p>Treadles, or foot pedals that drive a rotating mechanism, are first found in China around the 2nd century, and then in Europe around the 12th century. Spinning wheels use treadles but also use belt drive and multiple subsystems that run at different speeds. </p>

<p>Ultimately these increasingly sophisticated mechanisms enabled mechanical clocks, which involved many mechanisms rotating at different rates. Water clocks had been an improvement over sundials but had many shortcomings. For example, they didn’t operate in freezing temperatures. </p>

<p>Was there a gravity-based alternative to water clocks? A trebuchet-like idea was used and eventually culminated in mechanical clocks in the 14th century. These clocks were extremely elaborate, less functional and more status symbols and statements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giovanni's clock was only incidentally a timepiece. It included the celestial wanderings of sun, moon, and five planets. And provided a perpetual calendar of all religious feasts, both fixed and movable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrist watches were even trickier since they relied on springs which uncoiled and provided variable force during their uncoiling. These led to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoeP0adbDKg">escapement</a> mechanism, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/cpVkTSZrg_A?t=100">fusee</a>, both impressively complex mechanisms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps no problem in mechanics has ever been solved so simply and so perfectly - Gawaine Baillie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s funny how underrated this time is from tech perspective, at least in the popular imagination. To me it feels like a veritable industrial revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, the four centuries following Leonardo, that is, until electrical energy demanded a supplementary set of devices, were less technologically engaged in discovering basic principles than in elaborating and refining those established during the four centuries before Leonardo.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Perpetual motion</h1>

<p>All of these mechanical inventions were inspired by the ideal of a perpetual motion machine. This was not so outlandish pre-thermodynamics, given that windmills and water mills appeared to be moving perpetually. Perpetual motion through Gravity and magnetism became the holy grail. </p>

<p>Roger Bacon c. 1260 imagined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machines may be made by which the largest ships, with only one man steering them, will be moved faster than if they were filled with rowers; wagons may be built which will move with incredible speed and without the aid of beasts; flying machines can be constructed in which a man... may beat the air with wings like a bird... machines will make it possible to go to the bottom of seas and rivers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asides:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wondered if король comes from Carolingian. Nope, it comes from Charlemagne. That said, apparently "Carolingian" and in fact Charlemagne are both named after Charles Martel. In turn, Charles is a name from the common Germanic noun meaning "man". Go figure...</li>
<li>Lots of references to Bayeux tapestry. It's <a href="https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/discover-the-bayeux-tapestry/explore-online/">available online...</a></li>
</ul>

        <p>Overall a dense but short listen. Potpourri of new ideas, and far better than
<em>Why Information Grows by Cesar Hidalgo</em>. This lecture is well organized,
engagingly narrated, with memorable examples. A great, rather intense
introduction to Complexity.</p>

<p>A criticism I had was that Page attempts to weave too many disparate threads
together. The final chapter gives practical takeaways but they feel trite and
don't really integrate the most interesting parts from earlier in the book.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here are some ideas I from the book I found interesting.</p>

<p><em>Wolfram’s four system types</em> -
<a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p231--four-classes-of-behavior/">https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p231--four-classes-of-behavior/</a></p>

<p><em>Complexity happens in a sweet spot</em> - There are four necessary conditions for
complexity. But it's necessary that all of these conditions be present in
moderate quantities. Too much or too little of any of them will lead to
equilibrium, not complexity.</p>

<p><em>Measuring diversity generally speaking</em> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index</a></p>

<p><em>Dancing landscape</em> - rugged landscapes that change over time.</p>

<p><em>Creative vs. evolutionary processes</em> - Evolution is relentless and infinitely
persistent, like the tortoise. Creativity requires drive from a specific group
of people, who are finite in energy and time, but can move quickly, like the
hare. </p>

<p><em>Power law vs normal distributions</em> - Many things are normally distributed.
But some are power law distributed. Why? Independent events leads to normal
distribution. Interdependent events leads to power law distributions. </p>

<p><em>Explore vs exploit trade-offs</em> - A well formulated treatment on this subject.</p>

<p><em>Self-organized criticality</em> - the idea that many systems approach a critical
state automatically.</p>

<p><em>Simulated annealing</em> - an approach to finding global maximums under certain
constraints.</p>

<p><em>Complexity is in the eyes of the beholder</em> - if you're really smart, checkers
is just tic-tac-toe, and no longer complex. Is that right?</p>

    <title>Diffusion of Literacy in 19th Century Canada</title>

        <p>The ancient Sumerians invented writing sometime around 3500 BCE. But how did
writing get refined? How did it spread outside of Sumer? In general, tracking
diffusion of ancient technology is hard. For tracking the spread of literacy,
however, here's an interesting idea. Innumerate people may fudge their
self-reported age to round or auspicious numbers. Individually, this leads to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7l5ZeVVoCA">terrible earworms</a>. In aggregate, this error is called age heaping
and may be a decent proxy for literacy. In this post, I dig into the Province of
Canada's 1852 census, scraped from automatedgenealogy.com. To whet your
appetite, just look at these beautiful age heaps:</p>

<p><img src="/diffusion-of-literacy-canada/ages_1852_census_heaps.png" alt="Age Heaps in Canada's 1852 census" /></p>

<p>Splitting the census data by demographics and calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple%27s_index">ABCC Index</a>
on each, what can we infer about literacy in 19th Century Canada?</p>

<!--more-->

<h1>Timelines shminelines</h1>

<p>It's easy to create a timeline of historical inventions. Steam Engine? No
problem: 100 CE. Musical Notation? 2000 BCE. Bam! Land mines? 1277. There are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_historic_inventions">many</a>
<a href="https://smus.com/visual-chronology-science-discovery/">such</a>
<a href="https://localhistories.org/a-timeline-of-science/">timelines</a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chronology+science&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss">available</a>.
But the first known working date of an invention is usually a miniscule part of
the whole story. More interesting is what led to the invention being practical.
How was it refined? How did it spread? What was the impact? What cascade of
other inventions did it lead to? What were the cultural implications, the second
order effects?</p>

<h1>Technological diffusion is hard to measure</h1>

<p>William Gibson famously quipped, "the future is already here —  it's just not
very evenly distributed." Well, how uneven is the distribution? What about over
time? For ancient inventions, the archaeological record is often sparse.
Historians of technology fall back to depictions in art and philolology, both
often controversial sources.</p>

<h1>Aside: psychology of numbers</h1>

<p>I recently came across some finishing times for the 2019 Boston Marathon, which
included very clear peaks at the qualifying time (~3h for that year) as well as
round numbers:</p>

<p><img src="/diffusion-of-literacy-canada/boston_marathon_2019.png" alt="Boston Marathon 2019 finishing times" /></p>

<p>It's inspiring to see people strive for and achieve goals. When I tweeted this,
@MelancholyYuga introduced me to a phenomenon I'd not heard of called Age
Heaping.</p>

<h1>Literacy from self-reported age?</h1>

<p>Here's the theory: people that struggle with numbers often don't know their own
age precisely, instead producing a round or lucky number.  Perhaps because they
can’t subtract to infer their current age from their birth year and the current
year. Or perhaps because they don't know their birth year at all. In aggregate,
these errors add up to create Age Heaps, clearly visible at decades, with
smaller peaks at ages ending in 5.</p>

<p>Given any survey with self-reported ages, one can calculate a metric that
estimates the literacy of a population. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple%27s_index">Various indices</a> like Whipple's
Index or ABCC Index quantify this.</p>

<h1>Finding an early census is hard</h1>

<p>Rather than read boring papers, I decided to try this idea on a raw dataset. I
immediately thought of the Domesday book, a famous medieval English survey.
Happily, it's been digitized and is available online in quite a nice form at
<a href="https://opendomesday.org/">opendomesday.org</a>. Unfortunately, the survey was not
granular enough to ask for self-reported ages, mostly focusing on the shire
level.</p>

<p>Newer historical census data is generally owned by the government, but then
digitized and indexed by private companies usually focused on genealogy, such
as <a href="https://familysearch.org">https://familysearch.org</a>. A fascinating wrinkle on early US censuses:
before 1840, the US census only named the head of household and then bucketed
dependents into seemingly arbitrary age categories: (0-10, 10-16, 16-26, 26-45,
45+). This throws a wrench into finding any Age Heaps.</p>

<p>Another source for data with self-reported ages are US passenger arrival
records, for example this <a href="https://heritage.statueofliberty.org/">Ellis Island arrival
database</a>. Once again, you can search the
corpus via their website, but they do not provide the underlying dataset, even
if you ask them nicely by email.</p>

<h1>1852 Census of the Province of Canada</h1>

<p>I was about to throw in the towel but then found
<a href="https://automatedgenealogy.com">https://automatedgenealogy.com</a>, a crowdsourced effort to digitize old
(pre-1920) Canadian censuses. Digitizing a census is tricky since the records
were entirely handwritten in flowing cursive, and I don't think we have good
enough OCR to make a dent on this problem. So the process involves transcribers
and verifiers working in tandem. I'm not entirely sure how well vetted the <a href="http://automatedgenealogy.com/census52/index.jsp?locale=en">data
from the site</a> is,
but I scraped it to do this analysis anyway. </p>

<p>This census includes the following fields:</p>

<ol>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Occupation</li>
<li>Country of Origin</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Self-reported Age (YAY!)</li>
<li>Sex</li>
</ol>

<p>The self-reported age field is key. But the other demographic information is
also interesting. Looking at ABCC scores for sub-populations will be fun.</p>

<h1>ABCC Indices by demographics</h1>

<p>First off, I was pleasantly surprised to see very clear age heaping in this
census.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th></th><th>ABCC Score</th><th>Souls</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Overall</td><td>88%</td><td>1134930</td></tr>

<h1>Wait, what exactly are ABCC Indices measuring?</h1>

<p>But is it really the case that if you don't know your age, you're likely to be
innumerate? All signs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7l5ZeVVoCA">point to yes</a>.</p>

<p>More seriously, a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ehr.13087?af=R">big caveat</a> applies here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though it can stand in as an acceptable proxy for literacy, our findings
  suggest that age-heaping is most plausibly interpreted as a broad indicator of
  cultural and institutional modernization rather than a measure of cognitive
  skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Mostly open questions around the edges</h1>

<p>I suppose it makes sense that merchants (ABCC 92%) and skilled craftsmen
(Blacksmith 90%, Tailor 91%) would be more advanced on a measure of "cultural
and institutional modernization" as compared to servants (71%) and laborers
(79%).</p>

<p>It also makes sense that those born in Canada would remember their age better
than immigrants. The simplest explanation is that those born in Canada are
generally younger. Looking at the two age distributions side-by-side is
revealing:</p>

<p><img src="/diffusion-of-literacy-canada/born_in_canada.png" style="float: left; width: 50%;"/>
<img src="/diffusion-of-literacy-canada/born_outside_canada.png" style="float: left; width: 50%;"/></p>

<p>But why are residents of Canada East so much better at telling their own age
than those of Canada West? </p>

<p>And why do Methodists know their age so much better than Catholics? I've always
found protestant denominations mysterious. The plot thickens!</p>

<p><img src="/diffusion-of-literacy-canada/methodists.png" style="float: left; width: 50%;"/>
<img src="/diffusion-of-literacy-canada/catholics.png" style="float: left; width: 50%;"/></p>

<p>Speculating wildly, if your culture is really into birthdays, you would closely
track your age and the age of close relatives. Knowing your own age would then
have little bearing on your ability to write or do arithmetic, throwing shade on
the whole premise.</p>

<h1>Eyes on the prize</h1>

<p>I'd originally hoped to find a way to measure diffusion of literacy
over time. But the 1852 Census of Canada only gives a single snapshot in time,
and other census data available on automatedgenealogy.com does not overlap
geographically.  In search for more data, I found and purchased <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/series-description.jsp?s=4434&amp;col=1002">Russians to
America Passenger
Data</a>,
covering 1834 - 1900.</p>

<p>Quick pre-registration of hypotheses on that dataset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subsequent waves of Russian immigrants exhibit increasing ABCC. </li>
<li>Strong correlation between size of city of origin and ABCC.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned and find out.</p>

    <title>Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>After reading <em>Player of Games by Iain M. Banks</em>, I wanted to read another in the Culture Series mainly for the world-building. </p>

<p>Consider Phlebas is a fast paced adventure book. The protagonist Bora Horza Gobuchul is unreasonably superhuman, possessing super strength, a great fighting ability, and among many other things, the ability to change his appearance at will. He finds himself in increasingly ridiculous situations, at one point stranded on a small island populated by fanatical cannibals. I found the plot itself to be so out there, parts of it read like my 10 year old self's stream of thought in an early creative writing assignment.</p>

<p>That said, Banks does a good job with the world-building. Set in the middle of the Idiran - Culture war, Horza sides with the Idirans mainly out of hatred for the culture. This is a fascinating conflict, reminiscent in some ways of modern divisions between progressive leftism and traditional conservatism. The author does a great job of making both factions quite relatable, and the protagonist morally ambiguous.</p>

<p>Idirans are monotheists, modeled on the fervent Jewish/Muslim variety. They range from zealots to pragmatists, but all have a clear sense of identity about them. Physically and spiritually my mind renders them as the Protoss from Starcraft. Except they have three limbs, and are in symbiosis with another race of six-limbed sentient beings.</p>

<p>The culture is sort of a macrocosm of Western society, far more technologically advanced, and taken to an extreme. All things, strengths and weaknesses are exaggerated. They rely heavily on sentient machines, and creatively named spacecraft. The lifestyle is decadent and are subject to the <em>Tyranny of Convenience</em>. The have a general lack of conviction, and no skin in the game.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Horza is killed by an Idiran that mistrusts him. A moral lesson from Mr. Banks? The non-Hollywood ending is refreshing, given the superhero-like attributes of the protagonist.</p>

<p>The scale conveyed in this novel is huge, and well executed. The destruction of the Vavatch orbital is well described. Epic battle scenes are extremely cinematic and would play out well in an adaptation to the screen. But the end could have been shortened significantly. I was quite tired of the endless underground tunnels of Char's World. Overall, a fun read if you're into a fast paced, sometimes ridiculous action novel.</p>

    <title>Why Information Grows by Cesar Hidalgo</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Why Information Grows starts off strong with an accessible introduction to information theory and some interesting physics-inspired ideas. Sadly, as the book proceeds, it becomes clear that the author has pieced together multiple essays that were and remain loosely connected. It's clearly a derivative work, often far less clear than the books that are cited.</p>

<p>That said, a few things stood out for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prigogine's work on <em>Dissipative systems</em> and their applications. </li>
<li><em>Artifacts as crystallized imagination</em></li>
<li>The <em>Resource curse</em></li>
</ul>

<h1>Information is the opposite of entropy</h1>

<p>Information is stimuli that has meaning in some context for its receiver. There is some relationship between information and complexity and information and order but Hidalgo dances around this question.</p>

<h1>Information in the universe is fractally distributed</h1>

<p>Information is rare in our universe. As far as we know, Earth is one place where information is highly concentrated. Earth is to information like black holes are to matter. This observation struck me as very anthropocentric. Maybe I'm reading too much science fiction!</p>

<p>On Earth, information is not uniformly distributed. Specific countries, companies, and individuals seem to represent more of it.</p>

<h1>Rubic's cube example from an info theory perspective</h1>

<p>The author does a decent job of explaining basic information theory. I liked his Rubic's cube example:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are e19 different states in the system.  </li>
<li>The most information is in the lowest entropy state, the solved solid colored state</li>
<li>You can’t just jump to the solved state without cheating</li>
<li>It takes under twenty moves to solve a cube from any state</li>
<li>Most algorithms take longer than the theoretical optimum sequence of moves.</li>
<li>Most random moves cause entropy to increase.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Information state changes are constrained</h1>

<p>The Rubic's cube can't go from any state to any other state unless you cheat and detach the cubes from the cube's core. The only valid moves are rotations. This is a profound point that I think is super relevant for any policy discussions. Often it’s very clear what a desired state of affairs is, but very unclear how to get to there. </p>

<h1>Encoding information</h1>

<p>Application to DNA: interesting sequences that code for something important are usually the least random ones. (Really?) Notably these information rich states don’t tell us about what this DNA means. Meaningless forms of order. </p>

<p>Information itself is meaningless. But can be absorbed my people to form knowledge. And practice can lead to know-how which I think is same idea as métis as in <em>Seeing Like a State by James Scott</em> and сноровка. </p>

<h1>Energy flows cause spontaneous order</h1>

<p>Entropy only increases in a closed universe. Meaning that this universe has no flow of energy into or out of it. </p>

<p>Ilya Romanovich Prigogine, a Russian Jewish born Belgian studied <em>Dissapative systems</em>, which are systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with substantial steady-state flows of energy. Earth is such a system because the sun is the source of all our power.</p>

<p>In situations where there is a steady state, there is a tendency for spontaneous order. A whirlpool will spontaneously appear when you open the drain to a bath tub. Are there other simple examples?</p>

<p>This is super cool! Imagine all of life as a sort of very complex whirlpool. Actually, Ted Chiang kinda did in a more poetic version of this idea found in the story called Exhalation. <em>Exhalation by Ted Chiang</em></p>

<h1>Information can be stored in solids</h1>

<p>Information can be preserved, and this preservation is best done in a solid state of matter, especially if it is non-uniform (eg. not a simple solid crystal, more like an organic molecule). The canonical example of this is DNA. </p>

<p>I didn't really like Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but this quote works well here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That's all the motorcycle is, a system of concepts worked out in steel. There's no part in it, no shape in it, that is not out of someone's mind - Robert M. Pirsig</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Goldilocks zone for information to appear and remain</h1>

<p>Interesting analogy to physics: a desirable temperature range. you need liquidity for information to grow (eg. Whirlpool example, as well as the notion of liquid networks from <em>Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson</em>). But if it’s too liquid, solids can’t form to store that information. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are no long chains of proteins in the sun</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Energy is needed for information to emerge and solids are needed for information to endure. For information to explode we need the ability of matter to compute. </p>

<h1>Simple computation, very broadly defined</h1>

<p>Hidalgo defines computation extremely broadly. You don’t even need life for computation to occur in the natural world. He introduces a simple example of computation, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_clock">chemical clock</a>, in which a set of regents can be mixed together to make a reaction that transitions in states at predictable time frames. Trees also compute in a similar way. </p>

<p>I don't really see what practical connection there is to computation the way we think of it more colloquially. </p>

<h1>Products as crystallized imagination</h1>

<p>Everyone uses toothpaste. Very few know how to produce sodium fluoride, or how to get it into that tiny tube. Toothpaste the product gives billions of people access to the practical benefits that a small group of toothpaste inventors created. Products allow us to transcend our individual limits. Toothpaste gives everyone the ability to maintain our teeth into old age. </p>

<p>Crystallized information comes in many forms. Most of human activity is like this. Writing, speaking, music making, dancing. But Hidalgo only cares about products. Products empower others with practical uses of your ideas. </p>

<p>The economy then is the substrate that allows products to spread from one individual to another. </p>

<p>I'm mildly annoyed at the author for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not really justifying why he's so obsessed with products specifically. From an information growth perspective, does art not also compound?</li>
<li>Calling these things "products". It's very capitalist-y for no good reason. I strongly prefer artifacts.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The bad stuff</h1>

<p>The first part of the book discussing information theory and Prirogine's ideas was quite good. </p>

<p>Next, Hidalgo tries to apply information theory to people, companies, countries, and the global economy. This gets increasingly awkward. </p>

<h2>Personbytes, a useless analogy</h2>

<p>The personbyte is a transparently info theory derived quantity that's supposed to somehow represent a person's raw potential, I guess? The analogy is not great but illustrates a point. The information-theory notion of a byte is clean and mathematically precise. Applying it to people seems oddly reductive. People vary hugely in their potential and are products of their culture which is perpetually evolving. Stripped of this, we are just smart monkeys. My personal preference is to not introduce this faux-information theory concept. The same points could be made better without it.</p>

<p>Hidalgo's ultimate point is well taken: that the crystallized imagination encoded in artifacts increase your own imaginative potential. This puts you in a sort of a network with other people, and being part of this network lets you create more complex output. It’s much easier to build an electric scooter if your job is to put pieces together rather than inventing battery, electric motors, aluminum welds etc.</p>

<h2>Firmbytes...</h2>

<p>Hidalgo continues down this road and introduces the firmbyte, a unit of quantization for companies. Similar critiques apply.</p>

<p>Ford once had a plant called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_River_Rouge_Complex">The Rouge</a> that created cars end-to-end, taking iron ore, soy beans, rubber as input, then performing the whole manufacturing process (refining, smelting, forming, cauterizing, etc). This facility spanned an area roughly 2km x 2km and employed 100,000 people. This isn't common practice anymore.</p>

<p>Manufacturers don’t generally own the whole production line from raw material to final product. There is a natural unit size for a company, and that is the firmbyte. Again, extremely fuzzy, maybe inspired by information theory. Do not want.</p>

<p>The point here is even weaker: some things require multiple companies, or firmbytes to create. If there's too much friction to doing deals between companies, large networks can't be formed. Free trade agreements and standardization reduce friction between companies.</p>

<h2>Imagination trade imbalances</h2>

<p>Blending the idea of crystallized imagination and global trade, Hidalgo considers trade imbalances from the perspective of imagination. In the trade between Korea and Honduras, there is an imagination trade imbalance, with Korea providing in the commodity of imagination. He then ranks countries in terms of how much information capital they produce. Again, meh. </p>

<p>Hidalgo touches a bit on the <em>Resource curse</em>. This would be interesting to understand in more detail. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse</p>

<h2>More derivative stuff</h2>

<p>In the spirit of being a random amalgamation of cool ideas Hidalgo likes:</p>

<ul>
<li>High trust enables lower transaction costs, as per <em>Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam</em></li>
<li>Family is for communism, market is for capitalism.  <em>Debt by David Graeber</em></li>
</ul>

    <title>Emotional Life of the Toddler</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/emotional-life-of-the-toddler"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>"Every generation Western Civilization is invaded by barbarians. We call them children." — Hannah Arendt</p>

<p>Alicia F. Lieberman begins with a milder version of the same sentiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the raising of every toddler, society recapitulates its own development. When a child is caught between the impulse to strike out and the fear of its consequences, conscience begins to be formed and civilization begins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Relatable vignettes</h1>

<p>Mom speaks very highly of a classic Russian book called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%82_%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%85_%D0%B4%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B8">От Двух до Пяти</a> (from Two to Five) which is a sort of proto-listicle of funny things small children say. It's fun, but I feel that as a parent I get a lot of these gems delivered to me on a daily basis from my own children.</p>

<p>Anyway, the author cites this exact book on toddler creativity. Struck me as a relatively rare of example of US-Russian citation.</p>

<p>Many vignettes are dispersed throughout this book too, some instructive and very relatable scenes. For example of Sonia, a 2.5 year old who sings loudly at the dinner table, diverting attention from the adult guest conversation.</p>

<p>Other stories are more creative and thought provoking, or just plain funny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Damian is sitting at a table in his day care center, slowly moving his jaws and mouth while staring into space. "What are you chewing, Damian?" asks his caregiver. "I'm chewing Mommy," replies Damian dreamily.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow the author can contain her laughter and respond seriously and eloquently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Damien's answer tells us with haikulike conciseness about a major aspect of the toddler's child care experience: missing the parent, yet holding on to her through a combination of memory, hope, and imagination. By chewing on his mother's image, Damian is carrying her in the most reliable place of all-inside himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Raw human insight</h1>

<p>When words are not enough:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Putting things into words has an inherent alienating effect because the part of the experience that remains unnamed is cut off and fragmented from the portion that is given official existence through language... When a precious toy is broken, words such as "sad" or "disappointed" cannoy possibly capture the enormity of the child's loss... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coaxing children to express their feelings in words before they are ready alienates them from access to the unspeakable realms of experience and teaches them wrongly that talking is equivalent to feeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On age-related fear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout the life cycle the age-specific sources of anxiety have to do with life tasks we understand only imperfectly and have many fantasies about. For junior toddlers, this may center on movement and toilet training; for senior toddlers and 3- and 4-year-olds, on the differences between boys and girls and how babies are made; for young adults, on the secrets of love; for very old people, on the mysteries of death and the world beyond. We tend to be afraid of what we do not know, and toddlers are no exception.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On play as simulation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Erik Erikson proposed the theory that play is the childhood version of a lifelong human propensity: setting up model situations to experiment with different ways of controlling reality. While playing, the toddler relives past events and in this process alleviates lingering anxiety and fear over what happened by “playing it out," just as adults derive emotional relief by “talking it out."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On toddlers vs. teenagers (I am afeared):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not until adolescence will parents face as many dilemmas in rais ing their children as they do in the toddler years. In fact, the second and third years of life are excellent practice for the challenges posed by a teenager. Toddlerhood resembles adolescence because of the ra pidity of physical growth and because of the impulse to break loose of parental boundaries. At both ages, the struggle for independence exists hand in hand with the often hidden wish to be contained and protected while striving to move forward in the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Other notes</h1>

<p>Interesting take on parental discord: sometimes it's okay to resolve mild disagreements in front of a toddler. This demonstrates how adults resolve conflict. Doing this may be better than trying to hide animosity and build up an atmosphere of tension.</p>

<p>Great passage on guilt. Scenario with Cynthia not wanting to stay with a babysitter. She is precocious and tells her mom things like “I will miss you too much” and “why are you going without me?” Her mom feels bad, alternating between reassurance that it’ll be fine and admonishment that the child should stop whining. </p>

<p>The remedy? A less accepting response. Assert with confidence that it’s gonna be ok. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Won’t Cynthia fee guilty if she is told that her mother doesn’t arove of her behavior? If she does her ability to feel guilty at 40 months will actually speak well for her emotional development. As they grow children like adults need to experience remorse when they do something that is not acceptable to others. Guilt is a useful emotion when felt in response to specific damaging behavior. It is unhealthy only when it is pervasive, as in the Case of children who constantly worry they’re doing something wrong. </p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Concluding...</h1>

<p>The formula of this book is to take ordinary moments in child rearing, buttress them with funny and creative anecdotes, and then deliver profound truths about human existence.</p>

<p>This is not a "how to" guide, or a collection of weird tricks to raise your children. It's so far the best written child rearing book I've encountered.</p>

    <title>High Middle Ages</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/high-middle-ages"/>
    
    <updated>2021-05-03T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/high-middle-ages</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Why study the middle ages, and history in general? Daileader provides a pragmatic answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some things seem like artifacts of modernity, but are a millennium old.</li>
<li>Others appear fundamental and static, but are in fact very recent and ephemeral.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless we can get the story straight, we'll have the wrong intuitions about the world today.</p>

<h1>Sandwich age</h1>

<p>Petrarch (13th century) believed that classical Greco-Roman art and culture was the apogee of humanity. After the fall of Rome, which he dated to the sack of Rome in 410, everything went downhill. Naturalism went out the window in favor of abstraction. The Latin language became corrupted. It was all horseshit! Petrarch hoped that his lifetime would see a return to classical values. His hope came true with the emerging Renaissance. Thus, two great eras in human history (classical &amp; renaissance) sandwiched a middle age so terrible it doesn't even deserve a proper name.</p>

<p>During the romantic period, the Middle Ages were viewed with nostalgia. Dirty, polluted, overworked people sought philosophers like Rousseau, who pined for the lush greenery of the past. Marx's vision of constant conflict between classes was seen in contrast to the harmonious system of <em>The Three Orders</em> of the Middle Age.</p>

<p>Medeival is just how you say Middle Age in Latin. Love it when simple things click into place. </p>

<h1>Population explosion</h1>

<p>Europe's population roughly doubled during the high middle ages (1000-1300), in contrast to <em>Early Middle Ages</em> (300-1000), where late Rome was charaterized by depopulation, followed by stagnation 700-1000. The era that followed, the <em>Late Middle Ages</em> were pummeled by the black death leading again to a decline in population. <em>Depopulation is often correlated with decline</em></p>

<p>Around 1000 CE, Europe was very rural. Cities had at most 10,000 people living in them. By 1300 many towns grow into cities and have 100,000 residents. </p>

<p>Why this growth?
1. Decline in foreign attacks (Arabs, Vikings, Magyar marauders), partly because all of the good stuff had already been looted.
2. Roman slave populations were so poorly treated, their populations were declining. As more slaves became serfs, they were treated better and could have higher birth rates.
3. Advances in agricultural technology
2. Climate change: 800 - 1200 is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period">Medeival Warm Period</a> a period of improved climate, improving crop yields.</p>

<p>As European cities grew, they became worthwhile stops for global merchants, since their markets now became big enough to be interesting. Italy dominated in trade because of its central position in the mediterranean. It's no accident that the famous Marco Polo emerges from Italy in 1270.</p>

<p>The monetary system also evolves around this time. At the height of Rome, a tri-metallic system was in place. Large transactions were done in gold coins, while bronze and copper coins were used for small daily transactions. By 1000, the continent regressed to a a much simpler system, relying on just silver for all transactions. By 1252, gold coinage was reintroduced by Florence: the florin. Small transactions were done in low quality silver. Related: <em>History of global mediums of exchange</em>.</p>

<h1>Aside on agricultural technology</h1>

<p>(Interesting: all three of these are energy efficiency-related...)</p>

<h2>Scratch plows =&gt; Moldboard plows</h2>

<p>As the Roman empire grew, the Scratch plow began to spread to northern Europe. This plow was designed with a short sharpened wooden stake, making shallow scratchy furrows well suited to dry Mediterranean soil. In contrast, Northern European soils were waterlogged and dense in clay, and the scratch plow hardly made a dent in such soil. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield#Seed_ratio">Seed ratios</a> in the early Middle Ages were abysmal, something like 2:1. </p>

<p>With the introduction of the Moldboard Plow (aka Heavy Plow) from eastern Europe, seed ratios improved drastically. This plow was far heavier, required wheels to move, and a much deeper, metal cutting blade. </p>

<h2>Ox yokes =&gt; Horse collars</h2>

<p>Romans used oxen to till the soil. These dumb animals were easily domesticated but slow. To pull a plow, a wooden device called a yoke would sit on top of the ox and the beast would plod across the length of a field. Plots tilled by oxen were long and narrow since ox teams were so hard to turn. <em>Second order effects and unintended consequences</em></p>

<p>Horses were much faster, but equally strong as oxen. However their anatomy was quite different from an ox, and the strap of the ox yoke would sit across the horse's neck, pressing on its windpipe. This not only reduced air supply reducing efficiency, but was also often fatal.</p>

<p>The padded horse collar was constructed with leather, and slipped over the horse's shoulders and did not cross its neck at all, allowing it to breathe freely. In addition to not causing broken windpipe related death, it increased horsepower by 5x.</p>

<h2>Water mills</h2>

<p>Romans knew about water mills, but did not build them very often. Slaves were so readily available in Rome that they could be relied on to power hand mills, a laborious and incredibly boring process of manually turning a crank. But as agricultural slavery was replaced by serfdom, European rivers become the new laborers.</p>

<h2>...Crop rotation</h2>

<p>Not mentioned in the lecture, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-field_system">Three Field System</a> of crop rotation seems to have emerged around the same time, and made big improvements to crop yields. The core insight there was that  Cereal crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. So one plot would be used for cereals, another for legumes, and the third to replenish itself, rotating every year.</p>

<h1>Those who fought</h1>

<p>In early Middle Ages knights were thugs. But they became increasingly legitimate in their power. As merchants became increasingly affluent and more of them wanted to join the ranks of the knights, there was a problem of <em>Elite overproduction</em>.  The fighting class (see <em>The Three Orders</em>) became so numerous that money alone stopped being enough to join. Now to be dubbed a knight you needed to prove that your bloodline was noble.</p>

<p>After the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the 9th century, noble infighting soared to dangerous highs. The church attempted to curtail this trend by designating days and periods in the calendar as peaceful through programs such as the Peace and Truce of God. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_book">Courtesy Books</a> were uninteresting lists written in Latin and ultimately fell on deaf ears, or into the hands of largely illiterate ruling class. These attempts did little to curtail noble violence.</p>

<h2>Chivalric Romances</h2>

<p>Chaplains were clergy members in the courts of noblemen. They were the most worldly of the clergy class and could thus find ways to appeal to the fighting class. The approach that worked turned out to be the new literary genre of Chivalric Romances, around 13th century. These were stories that depicted heroic knights on great adventures of love and conquest. The chivalric code insisted on romantic love with a woman in order to “civilize” a knight and encourage good deeds. </p>

<p>Chrétien de Troyes wrote simple stories exploring the balance between fighting and loving. In some, the hero focused too much on loving his wife and lost status in the field, causing his wife to leave him. In others, he focused too much on conquest at the expense of his relationship. Damned if you do, and damned if you don’t. Lancelot is a more complex classic, who had an extramarital affair with Arthur’s wife Gwyn.</p>

<h2>Tournaments</h2>

<p>Early tournaments around the 11th century evolved from free-for-all mounted melees taking place on large swaths of territory. They were not aimed explicitly at killing but at capture, but the structure was so loose that all bets were off. Action occurred with real weapons, and had real impacts on innocent bystanders, as well as other externalities. Crops were trampled, houses burned, peasants murdered. Not to mention the large death toll among the fighters. </p>

<p>King and clergy attempted to ban tournaments outright, but failed Instead, they evolved and became more formalized, converging to the 1-on-1 jousting matches with dulled lances and a barrier wall to prevent head on collisions. Knights that broke with chivalric norms, speaking ill of women or hurting the helpless, were disinvited from such gatherings. </p>

<h2>Feudalism</h2>

<p>A special relationship between members of the fighting class began to emerge: lord and vassal. A rising knight could swear an oath of fealty to a lord and become his vassal. This relationship involved rights and responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The lord gave his vassal a fief, usually a plot of land that the vassal would manage and collect income from. The lord would defend the vassal from harm.</li>
<li>The vassal would come to the lord's aid, usually in a military campaign. The vassal would also give advice to the lord, if the lord requested it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gradually, fiefs became hereditary. Eventually vassals began swearing fealty to multiple lords. The concept of liege lord was introduced to indicate the main lord that you are sworn to, but vassals would just swear fealty to multiple liege lords. People are awesome!</p>

<h1>Those who worked</h1>

<p>The status of ordinary folk generally improved during the period of 1000-1300. Agricultural slavery faded out and was replaced by serfdom. Most peasants of the time were serfs working for a lord, sometimes a noble, and sometimes a bishopric or monastery. As serfs, they owed their lord seigneurial obligations, meaning they had to till the land for free some number of days a week.</p>

<p>Serfdom gradually became less onerous and less common. Serfs that spent a year in a city would automatically become free, and many would escape in this manner. Lords would treat their serfs better to avoid losing their unpaid workforce entirely. More of the population moved into towns.</p>

<p>Townspeople were split into populo grosso (fat people), consisting of merchants and landlords and populo minuto (little people), consisting of artisans and farmers. </p>

<p>During periods of heightened violence, towns formed communes, associations of mutual defense which attempted to maintain peace, militia style. These associations were led by elected Consuls, elected for a set term, often a year. Consuls judged when members of the commune were injured, and decided when to exact vengeance.</p>

<p>A town would have one commune, but each trade was governed by its own guild: the bakers, the dyers, etc. To practice a trade you needed to belong to the guild. Guilds enforced the quality of work produced by its members and standardized production and distribution of goods to ensure that nobody had an unfair advantage.</p>

<h1>Those who prayed</h1>

<p>Secular clergy: priests headed by a bishop at a bishopric.
Regular clergy: monks headed by an abbot at a monastery.</p>

<p>Most monasteries were based on a Benedictine laws which were focused on austerity. In practice, many of these laws were bent and broken, especially by orphans and retirees, and others that found themselves in monasteries for reasons outside their own control. Monks could not own property of any sort, at least in theory. But in practice this was often not the case. Monasteries themselves were often rich, beneficiaries of large donations from non-monks as alms, with donors hoping to offset their misdeeds.</p>

<h2>Attempts at reform</h2>

<p>At various points monastic reforms were attempted to bring monasteries closer to their platonic ideal. Two ecclesiastical reform movements stand out, often for the cruelty gave their abbots: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluniac_Reforms">Cluniacs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians">Cistercians</a>. But these reverted to the mean within a couple of centuries. </p>

<p>Franciscans took a different route, insisting on a new kind of monk that does not belong to a monastery at all. Instead he must own nothing and beg for alms, mimicking the life of the apostles. They were led by St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226), who had pretty intense views. St. Francis did not permit his followers to store up money or provisions for a rainy day, since this indicated a lack of faith. Eventually the Franciscans were recognized by the papacy and their hard-line stances diluted.</p>

<p>The Gregorian movement attempted to reform the secular clergy. It enforced priestly celibacy, which had become uncommon. Simony, the practice of buying bishopric or abbotal appointments, was banned again. It was already illegal, but often eluded in practice. These reforms largely failed, sowing seeds for popular discontent with the church.</p>

<h2>Freethinkers and heretics</h2>

<p>As lay people became more literate, they began reading the Bible themselves and coming to their own conclusions. Literacy was highest in urban areas, where merchant class needed to be numerate and literate to do their work. (TODO: what was the actual spread of writing like over time and space? Has this been mapped in detail?)</p>

<p>This combination led to high rates of heresy, self described Christians that challenged the basic tenets of the faith. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism">Cathars</a> had a different take on Christianity. Cathars believed that the good God was the God of the New Testament, creator of the spiritual realm, whereas the evil God was the God of the Old Testament, creator of the physical world whom many Cathars identified as Satan. This was against the teachings of the church and they were labeled heretics. Waldenzians, followers of Peter Waldo shared a similar fate.</p>

<h2>Inquisition</h2>

<p>During the episcopal inquisition, bishops were asked to double down on the task of ensuring purity of belief of those in their bishopric, weeding out heretics. But many bishops resided in Rome or Paris and not in their bishopric. And bishops were generally very important and busy individuals.</p>

<p>When this failed, professional inquisitors were hired instead. Many of these were taken from the Franciscan and Dominican orders, already used to traveling and begging for alms. These inquisitors would go from village to village and ask the local priest to gather the residents together. The inquisitors were then trained to try to extract as much information as possible. Those that volunteered dirt on their fellow villagers early on would be rewarded with lighter sentences.</p>

<p>Torture by this point was common in Medieval justice. Inquisitors were allowed to use it too, but could not cause bloodshed, mutilation or death. When a subject was found guilty of heresy, they might be forced to wear a yellow cross on their clothing for the rest of their life. Or they would be handed over to the secular authorities to be burned alive.</p>

<h1>Jews of the High Middle ages</h1>

<p>As mentioned ad nauseam in <em>The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler</em>, Jews were often expelled from kingdoms. I even made a list of <em>History of Jewish Expulsions</em>.</p>

<p>Why? It was an easy way for kings to make quick money. They would seize Jewish assets and take ownership of all outstanding loans. But this would disrupt the economy, so these measures were often reverted quickly. </p>

<p>Jews were also forced to wear a badge (star, circle, etc) or a conical cap. Visual indicators were also forced on other minorities, like heretics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathar_yellow_cross">yellow cross</a>), prostitutes (yellow dress?), and lepers (rattle, clapper). Jews liked the privacy of living in their own enclaves, but the badges were universally hated. It made Jews visible targets of pogroms. The distinguishing badges could sometimes be removed by paying the sovereign a fee. The king would then annul this deal and force Jews to pay again, another money making scheme.</p>

<p>Especially dangerous times for Jews:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crusades would often trigger local pogroms, as echoes of holy war would resonate at home.</li>
<li>Easter sometimes saw accusations of blood libel, where Jews were accused of crucifying a Christian child gone missing from a village. No coincidence too with Christ’s death. Blood libel was only a popular belief, never an official position. </li>
</ul>

<p>During the high Middle Ages 1000-1300 prosperity increased but so did anti Jewish violence. </p>

<h1>Intellectual progress</h1>

<p>Monk style education involved rote memorization and recitation. There was no space for intellectual activity because it would open up the possibility of heresy. </p>

<h2>Scholastic philosophers</h2>

<p>Scholastic movement: beginning a tradition of comparison of multiple sources with the goal of synthesizing two seemingly incompatible perspectives into something coherent. Through valiant hoop jumping they seemed to be able to get to an interesting equilibrium. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard">Abelard</a> was an early famous Scholastic with a colorful but gruesome story. He began a tradition of debate, with explicit reliance on old texts - bible and derived works (eg. St. Augustine), but also blended it with the pagan philosophers like Aristotle and Plato.</p>

<p>Classic philosophers were accessible thanks to Islamic preservation efforts, especially the work of Ibn Rushd of Al-Andulus (Averroes). (Why was he not mentioned in <em>Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr</em>? Seems like that book devoted no time at all to Al-Andulus, just the caliphate centered at Baghdad.)</p>

<p>Scholastic practices were criticized and censored by the church. Their reliance on reason was seen as having excess hubris. Who are they to think that they can contribute something worthy of the great ancient thinkers? Also their reliance on Aristotle and Islamic commentaries and insufficiently on the Bible was seen as problematic. Indeed Aristotle directly contradicted church dogma on some issues. According to Aristotle,</p>

<ol>
<li>The world is eternal, never created</li>
<li>There are no souls, only a collective soul</li>
<li>There is one God greater than the other Gods, but he is not omnipotent or omniscient</li>
</ol>

<p>The church attempted to censor Aristotle but ultimately failed. Some Scholastic philosophers were accused of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_truth">double truth</a>” or of arriving at two different conclusions on an issue depending on whether they considered from a Christian or an Aristotelian perspective.</p>

<p>The most prominent scholastic scholar, St. Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican friar was canonized shortly after his death, illustrating the church's capitulation. Aquinas blended rationalism into Christianity. His magnum opus "Summa Theologica" contained five proofs for the existence of God.</p>

<p>According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.</p>

<h2>Early Universities</h2>

<p>Strange sub-plot with early universities. The first two universities in Europe were in Paris and in Bologna. </p>

<p>Students of universities were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerici_vagantes">Clerici vagantes</a> or vagabundi, Latin for wandering clergy. They were considered to be part of the secular clergy, and subject to special privileges as a result. No one was allowed to physically harm them; they could only be tried for crimes in an ecclesiastical court, and were thus immune from any corporal punishment. Students took advantage of this and broke secular laws with impunity, engaging in theft, rape, and murder. </p>

<p>One side effect of students as clergy was that under Canon Law, women could only be part of the regular clergy (nuns), but not part of the secular clergy, so were banned outright from universities.</p>

<h1>The First Crusade</h1>

<p>Pilgrimages had been a common practice in Christendom, and increasingly Jerusalem was seen as as destination for penitential pilgrimage. Holy war also had precedents: clergy had previously sponsored battles in which death was linked to salvation.</p>

<p>Crusaders were both pilgrims and holy warriors. This was a brilliant innovation which made the proposition extremely attractive to many people. Pilgrimage was dangerous, but here you were armed to the teeth and could fend for yourself. If you died en route, you would die as a holy warrior. However if you arrived at your destination, you would have fulfilled the pilgrimage. To sweeten the deal, crusaders were given plenary indulgences, remission of all penalties that resulted from sin. Win-win-win!</p>

<p>Crusades were declared by popes, and often for political reasons. The first crusade came shortly after the schism in the papacy. In this schism 1054, numerous disagreements between the Byzantines and the pope came to a head. Two sides failed to come to an agreement and severed ties. Shortly thereafter, the Byzantines were crushed by an Arab invasion. The sitting western pope wanted to try to reunite the church and offered military aid to the east in the form of the first crusade.</p>

<h2>Popular crusade</h2>

<p>The first part of the first crusade was led by common people. Many of these crusaders took a detour to first kill a bunch of Jews and loot their stuff in order to finance the trip to Jerusalem. This was done partly from sheer anti-semitism and holy war fervor, but partly from Millenarian convictions that the world would soon end, and that the ends to their salvation justified the means. </p>

<p>When this first wave of crusaders arrived to rendezvous with Byzantine forces, they arrived earlier than expected, were ill-equipped and hungry. This led to skirmishes among the Christians of the east and the west. Eventually those Popular Crusaders that survived were slaughtered by the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor.</p>

<h2>Baron's crusade</h2>

<p>A colorful story, this time about the adventures of crusading knights of noble rank. About 7000 departed from various European kingdoms organized in loose bands under a variety of local leaders. When they arrived at Constantinople to rendezvous with the Byzantines they were not greeted kindly by the Byzantine king Alexios I. Having just been ravished by the people’s crusade he did not trust the westerners and insisted they sign a treaty to ensure territories recently owned by Byzantines would be returned to them. </p>

<p>First taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Nicaea">Nicaea in 1097</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Antioch">Antioch in 1098</a>, joint Crusader-Byzantine forces marched toward Jerusalem. However these victories only further eroded relations between east and west. The crusaders took Antioch, and left no prisoners, and their leader Bohemond decided to keep the city for himself, breaching the oath he swore to Alexios. Multiple waves of Muslim reinforcements attempted to take back the city, besieging the crusaders. The crusading knights nearly perished from famine. </p>

<p>A lowly priest named Peter Bartholomew had a vision wherein St. Andrew came to him and told him that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance">Holy Lance</a> was in Antioch. Enthralled by this, the crusaders began to dig in the cathedral in search for the Holy Lance. Initially coming up empty, Peter joined in the digging and found the object he was looking for, which boosted morale significantly. After fasting for 5 days, the already famished knights sortied out of the garrison with Raymond of Toulouse at the head, carrying the Holy Lance. Despite his general's suggestions, the Turkish commander decided to let all of the knights exit the city walls before engaging them in battle. Soon the Muslim troops were in panicked retreat.</p>

<p>After several months of rest at Antioch, a decimated crusading army set out for the ultimate goal Jerusalem in 1099. Another priest, Peter Desiderius had a vision: if the crusaders circumscribed the Jerusalem walls barefoot, the city would fall within nine days. Befuddled defenders spared these erratic barefoot knights. Sure enough, Jerusalem fell in seven days. This is shocking given an invading force of 1500 against city walls. Unmentioned in the lecture was the fact that an additional 10,000 infantrymen came as reinforcements via Jaffa. Using wood from the boats, Genoese engineers built two huge siege towers (called Malvoisin or "Bad Neighbors"), catapults and a battering ram. Eyewitnesses reported gruesome crusading with the entire population of the city indiscriminately murdered. </p>

<p>This first crusade marked a turning point in European standing on the world stage, previously clearly inferior to their more technological and culturally developed Muslim neighbors. </p>

<h1>Norman conquest — meanwhile in England</h1>

<p>The next few lectures were a review of <em>The Story of Medieval England</em>, but the enlarged scope of this lecture made for some new insights.</p>

<p>The Normans were partly Franks but also partly descendants of north men, Vikings that were invited to settle in western France by the Franks in an attempt to prevent other Vikings from raiding and pillaging. </p>

<p>Vikings seem to have settled often despite their reputation. They were a key genetic component to the Russian (see <em>The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler</em>), French, and English people.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exchequer an early accountant system in England. The name comes from the checkered board in which counters representing debts were moved around.</li>
<li>Domesday book: is this something where age rounding has been analyzed? Might be a cool baseline. Sadly, doesn't appear to include ages, according to the data in https://opendomesday.org/.</li>
<li>How can I find digitized versions of early censuses? <em>Age Heaping and Numeracy</em></li>
</ul>

<p>After the Norman conquest, there was an interesting dynamic between England and France. The French speaking Normans that conquered England were vassals to the French king. As a result, William the conqueror and his descendants like Henry II were both feudal subordinates and equals to the French kings. Things got especially weird when the English monarchs controlled large tracts of France (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_Empire">Angevin Empire</a>) through strategic marriages. </p>

<h1>Meanwhile in France</h1>

<p>By 987 France was being raided by Magyars, Vikings, and Arabs. The kings were no longer able to retain power. Aristocrats rebelled and split the Carolingian kingdom into smaller units. The subsequent dynasty that takes over is led by Hugh Capet, first of the Capetians. Under their watch France further fragmented into duchies and beyond. But the dynasty's lineage continued despite the fragmentation. This continuity helped prevent civil wars which usual meant bad news for the ruling family. </p>

<p>Learning from the mistakes of the Merovingians and Carolingians, the Capetians changed their succession style. The practiced anticipatory succession and picked an heir before your death. Rather than splitting the kingdom between all of the king's sons, the firstborn was given the kingdom, and his brothers received Appenages (see <em>Primogeniture vs partible inheritance</em>).</p>

<p>Eventually Louis VI the Fat began to try and assemble the disintegrated French kingdom. He retakes Île-de-France in relentless military attacks against the castellans that resided there. This became the base for expansion, a place to reimpose authority on rebel lords. </p>

<p>The Capetians waited patiently for opportunities to retake their holdings. They would buy out barons that went bankrupt. They would annex the duchy of a dead duke with no clear heirs.</p>

<p>Phillip II Augustus was the best known king in the Capetian dynasty, an unlikely ruler. Compared to his contemporary Richard Lionheart, he was not much of a warrior, shunning crusading. Instead, he focused on trying to recover French lands that were now in English hands due to the Angevin Empire. At first, he tried to turn King John against his brother Richard but his scheme failed. Finally he decided to exploit the feudal relationship with English kings. He summoned John to nominally resolve a dispute between John and one of his French vassals. When John failed to show up, Philip declared his vassal John Lackland's possessions in the European continent forfeit. </p>

<p>Philip begins repossessing English lands on the continent. First he took Normandy, then Anjou. John forms an alliance with German king Otto of Brunswick. In 1214, a joint English-German invasion of France begins to try to retake back the Angevin lands. Philip II defeats Otto at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bouvines">Battle of Bouvines</a>. Upon seeing the Germans crushed, John retreats fearing a similar fate. This confirms Philip's reconquest, leaving just a small region in the French southwest under English control. </p>

<p>Around the same time, the pope declared a crusade against the south of France known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade">Cathar Crusade</a>. Supposedly those in the south were harboring Cathar heretics and thus needed to be cleansed, one of the major cities harboring them was Carcassonne. This was a twenty year affair, extremely bloody. Overall this led the decentralized French political system (discussed in early Middle Ages), further damaged by English conquest, to centralize again under a powerful king. See <em>Decentralization and Centralization cycles</em></p>

<h1>England's Canterbury Debacles</h1>

<p>A bit more review of <em>The Story of Medieval England</em>, but Thomas Beckett's story is truly fascinating. Appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury by Henry II, Thomas Beckett, personal friend of the king quickly turns on him. Rather than buttressing royal power as expected by Henry, Beckett strongly criticized the corrupt system of royal ecclesiastical appointments. His subversion exiles him to Paris for 6 years, but upon returning, Beckett continues as before. Apocryphally, Henry II asks “will no one rid me of this pesky priest?”, whereupon four of his knights travel to Canterbury and kill Beckett in cold blood in his own cathedral. Beckett is quickly canonized and Henry II pays the price both in PR and by being embarrassingly lashed by monks.</p>

<p>Henry II's son John is also tied up by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_election_of_1205">long quarrel at Canterbury in 1205</a>: after the prior archbishop dies, the monks elected a new one, egged on by a doctrine of Papal Supremacy. This is legal but not how the English king liked it — it was normally an appointment in practice. John refuses the election and instead pressured the monks to select his preferred candidate. They agreed to this but the two archbishop candidates both insisted on their legitimacy. As a result the papacy intervenes and insists that both candidates are invalid and that a third archbishop be selected. John refuses this and the pope declares an interdict, a sort of clerical strike in which only key services like baptisms are done. This lasts 6 years and John finally gives in when Innocent III begins to support John's deposition. Ultimately the pope's candidate Stephen Langton becomes Archbishop of Canterbury. Throughout this long period, King John does nothing to retake English possessions retaken by Phillip II, giving him time to prepare.</p>

<p>English barons in France were in a weird position: are they now loyal to France, or to England? They pressured John Lackland to retake the lands. Finally after the botched English-German attack on France, the English barons rebel. They take London and force John to accept the Magma Carta. </p>

<h1>Magna Carta</h1>

<p>A lot of the Magma Carta contains detailed articles that were designed to limit the king's power. Article 39 had more longstanding relevance to us, imposed formal legal restraints on royal will, declaring that no action detrimental to a free man’s life, limb or property was to be taken without a prior judgment in a lawfully constituted court. Within a year John rejects the Magna Carta and then promptly dies. His son Henry III accepts it and has a long reign, paving the path toward a fledgling parliament.</p>

<p>Henry III used the parliament to seek financial aid. The Barons agreed but pushed back, insisting on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisions_of_Oxford">Provisions of Oxford</a>, which gave a group of barons representation in the king's government. The king would gather and consult Great Councils on occasion. These would sometimes include commoners as well as barons. Initially mostly to collect money, these gradually became more formalized in time, soon were done thrice a year. </p>

<p>Despite all this turmoil, 13th century England had a strong and stable monarchy, at least compared to France and Germany. This led barons to really push back on the monarchy and lobby for more power. This led to rudimentary checks and balances and eventually English Common Law. In weaker states, there was less need for these balances since the king was already weak. Thus when countries like France centralized again, their monarchs became extremely powerful, their power unchecked.</p>

<h1>Meanwhile in Germany</h1>

<p>Holy Roman emperors in the territory of Germany had done well for themselves while France was fallen apart into smaller pieces. These Teutonic rulers held a firm grasp on the church through the practice of investiture, in which kings appointed important abbots and bishops. </p>

<h2>Investiture controversy</h2>

<p>Popes had extra leverage over Holy Roman Emperors since the pope was the only individual allowed to crown an emperor, a tradition that went back to Constantine. As part of Gregorian reforms, pope Gregory VII decided to take action against investiture. He terminated a group of imperially appointed bishops in Italy (part of the Holy Roman Empire). In response, Emperor Henry IV wrote a letter denouncing the pope and calling for his resignation. To which Gregory responded, I’m not fired — you’re fired. He excommunicated and deposed Henry IV. German elites then took advantage of the mess, and decided to rebel against their ruler. As a result, Henry IV rushed back to Rome to apologize to the pope. </p>

<p>The apology led to a temporary truce, but it was clear to the pope that it was not a sincere apology. Also, the German aristocracy was not done rebelling. They declare an alternative candidate, Rudolph as German King. Three years later, Gregory VII declared his support for Rudolph and excommunicated Henry IV. In response, Henry IV declares a new pope and lays siege to Rome with the intent of forcibly replacing the current pope with his candidate known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_Clement_III">Antipope Clement III</a>. Pope Gregory VII comes close to death as Henry IV takes Rome in 1084, but is saved by an army of Normans that the pope calls on for help. They arrive and force Henry to retreat, but in their zeal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1084)">plunder Rome</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually several imperial generations later, a truce is reached under the Concordat of Worms (pronounced Verms). This compromise ends the practice of investiture but allows an imperial representative to weigh in on clerical elections. The German kingdom loses power and standing. Enterprising aristocrats use this opportunity to build castles and otherwise entrench their own power base, similar to what happened in France centuries earlier.</p>

<p>The Ottonian dynasty doesn’t fare as well as the Capetians. Overall Henry IV reign shows the weakness of Germany in the 13th century.</p>

<ul>
<li>too dependent on their aristocracy, who were keen to take advantage of any weakness.</li>
<li>too dependent on the papacy, leading to crusades being launched against the Holy Roman Empire.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collapse of the Holy Roman Empire</h2>

<p>Frederic II was a famous member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The end of his reign marks the point of complete disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's contemporaries called him stupor mundi, the "astonishment of the world".</p>

<p>Born in Sicily, Frederic II was fluent in Arabic. He was well read and even wrote books about hawking. Early in his reign he went on crusade, took a vow to participate or risked excommunication, by then a common issue between kings of Germany and popes. He fell ill (or may have pretended to do so) on his voyage to Jerusalem. The pope promptly excommunicated him and prevented him from continuing the crusade until excommunication was lifted. However, to lift excommunication, pope Gregory IX requested a small gift: Sicily.</p>

<p>Frederic II ignored all of the above and continued on to Jerusalem. Taking advantage of Muslim infighting of the time, he secured Jerusalem for Christendom through diplomacy alone. However the pope was resentful, calling Frederic preambulus Antichristi and denied this treaty. Instead, a papal army marched on Sicily. Frederic was not greeted warmly in Jerusalem by fellow Christians because of an interdict. Frederic II returned quickly to Sicily to quash the papal forces. </p>

<p>A tentative peace breaks out for a decade. Pope Gregory IX, then his successor Innocent IV called for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Crusade">a crusade against Frederic II</a>. Crusaders with vows to the east are allowed to change course to fight Frederic II instead. Some of his own subjects turn against him. Civil wars rage beyond Frederic II's death in 1250, and Germany disintegrates further. The papacy denies election of further members of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The result is a final decimation of the Holy Roman Empire into a loose confederacy with an elected emperor. </p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>When I came across The Thirteenth Tribe, I knew that the stars had aligned. I just finished <em>Early Middle Ages</em> and really enjoyed <em>Darkness at Noon by Arthur Koestler</em> by Arthur Koestler. </p>

<p>The first half of the book focuses on the facts. Who were the Khazars? Who were the Rus? Where did these people come from? How did they interact with dominant Byzantines, Ummayads, Abassids? It's super readable and more engaging than prior lectures on the subject matter. That said, I feel that having listened to <em>Early Middle Ages</em> was a bit of a prerequisite. It would have been too hard to keep track of the major players otherwise.</p>

<p>In contrast, the remainder of the book is way more speculative. Koestler seems to have started with a thesis: Ashkenazi Jews are Khazars. A narrative then is carefully constructed gather the relevant evidence. However given that this is all set in Dark Ages, the facts are inherently sparse and shrouded in uncertainty. </p>

<h1>Conversion and neutrality</h1>

<p>The Khazars converted to Judaism because choosing Christianity or Islam would put them under the authority of either Baghdad or Constantinople. Their decision to convert may have been mostly a pragmatic one on these grounds. Reminds me of that quote attributed to Napoleon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is by making myself Catholic that I brought peace to Brittany and Vendée. It is by making myself Italian that I won minds in Italy. It is by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt. If I governed a nation of Jews, I should reestablish the Temple of Solomon."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Khazars adopted Hebrew script too. Some Hebrew letters, ש and צ made it into Cyrillic as ш and ц, after St. Cyril learned their language in Crimea.</p>

<p>Becoming a neutral territory meant that those fleeing forced conversion in Christendom and Islam world had a natural safe haven. Many Greek pagans and their rich classical traditions found their way to Khazaria. So did many Jews of the diaspora. </p>

<p>The conversion is chronicled by a Khazar king Joseph, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Correspondence">an exchange of letters</a> with Hasdai ibn Shaprut, a Jewish doctor living in Al-Andalus (modern Spain). In his response, Joseph recounts the Khazar conversion story. After dropping idolatry, King Bulan, sometime in the 8th century needed to choose between the three dominant religions. He gathered a panel of representatives and asked each separately which of the other two religions were least wrong. Judaism won by elimination, since both Christian and Muslim had greater affinity to it than to one another.</p>

<p>The Khazars seem to have been karaiites, meaning that they rejected the rabbinical teachings completely, and only followed the Torah. Meanwhile the rest of the diaspora, concentrated largely in Baghdad and large cities in Al-Andalus like Cordoba, practiced rabbinical Judaism, with a Gaon at the head.</p>

<h1>How Khazaria worked</h1>

<p>The Khazars were a Turcik people ruled by a system of dual kingship. The Khagan was the nominal ruler and figurehead. Menawhile the general executive and military general was called the Khagan Bek. Upon end of reign the Khagan was ritually killed.</p>

<p>Khazaria was a buffer state situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, shielding the Byzantine Empire from both Vikings and Arabs. </p>

<p>Perhaps there's a map in the printed version of this book, but I listened to it and found myself floundering a bit on the geography front. Embarassingly I found it hard to keep all of the rivers (Volga, Dniepr, Don, Ural) straight. I spent a bit of time and put <a href="https://borismus.github.io/central-asia-maps/">all the things on a map</a>, including two major cities, Atil the capital, and Sarkel, the remains of which were flooded by the Soviets in the 1950s.</p>

<h1>Varangians and Khazar decline</h1>

<p>The Varangians were Vikings. In the 9th century, they set out on large expeditions with the goal of raiding, trading, and sometimes a combination of both - "forced trade", as Koestler politely puts it. A typical raiding party would be composed of 500 longships of 100 people each. Vikings didn't usually establish permanent settlements outside of their traditional territories, but the Varangians were an exception.</p>

<p>When this group of vikings moved into the territory of modern Ukraine and Russia, they settled down near Kiev and became known as the Rus. They intermingled with native Slavs. Olga is Helga, Oleg is Helgi. Ivan, Ingvarr. Vladimir, Valdamarr. Mind, Blown.</p>

<p>Early Kievan Rus was a shit show. After Igor son of Rurik was killed by a tribe of Slavs called the Drevlians, his wife Olga exacted sweet revenge on them. Igor and Olga had a son, Sviatoslav, who was also a military hero and legendary warrior. Their children caused a civil war for succession. As Koestler would have us think, most of these early Rus regends tended to lead debaucherous lives and then convert to Christianity on their death bed. Some to be subsequently canonized. </p>

<p>Vladimir, son of Sviatoslav decided it was time to pick a religion. He did so in a Khazar-like fashion. Summoning delegation of representatives. The result is described by the chronicler Nestor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Of the <strong>Muslim</strong> Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them, only sorrow and a great stench. He also reported that Islam was undesirable due to its taboo against alcoholic beverages and pork. Vladimir remarked on the occasion: "Drinking is the joy of all Rus'. We cannot exist without that pleasure."</li>
<li>Ukrainian and Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with <strong>Jewish</strong> envoys and questioning them about their religion, but ultimately rejecting it as well, saying that their loss of Jerusalem was evidence that they had been abandoned by God.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Rus ⚔️ Khazars</h1>

<p>Khazaria and the Byzantines had a long standing alliance. But with price Vladimir’s conversion to orthodoxy, a union Of the Rus and Byzantine was cemented, paving the road for a joint campaign against Khazaria which was already weakened by then.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Khazars levied a 10% tax on traders going through their lands. This ticked off Viking Rus who were capable of trading and raiding.</p>

<p>Sviatoslav destroyed Sarquel and Atil. He had a reputation for having Berserkers in his ranks, from norse legend.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The Rus' attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch."</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>After the Khazar empire collapsed</h1>

<p>Chronologically, first the Khazar empire fell, then new Jewish settlements began to spring up in Poland. Clearly there was some flow between one and the other, but experts disagree how much of the population came from Khazars and how much from Jews ethnically tracing back to ancient Israelites. Koestler suggests that most Jews in Poland came from the Khazar empire, while a mere trickle joined from Spain.</p>

<p>Around this time the Shtetl began to emerge in Poland-Lithuanian empire. Origin dates to the 13th century.</p>

<p>Interesting connection between the kippa and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubeteika">Tubeteika</a>, or traditional headwear of steppe dwellers. </p>

<h1>A chronicle of suffering</h1>

<p>During the crusades, many Jews were forced to convert and many communities chose to self-immolate and die as martyrs. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many Jews of Maeonce, Strasbourg, Spires, ... escaped from centers and left their posessesions to kindly Burgers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>!<em>History of Jewish Expulsions</em></p>

<h1>Controversial conclusions</h1>

<p>According to Koestler, Khazars moved permanently west. Emigration from Poland followed the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, which codified anti Semitic practices by forcing Jews to wear special clothing, yellow bands and conical hats. The mostly Khazar Jews fled west from Poland Lithuania into Germany France Palestine and USA.</p>

<p>A big part of Koestler's thesis is that the differences between Jews and gentiles living in the same country are much smaller than difference between Jews living in different countries. Thus he claims that there is no real such thing as a Jewish race.</p>

<p>Apparently Koestler told French biologist Pierre Debray-Ritzen he "was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews (the ancestors of today's Ashkenazim) were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for anti-Semitism would be removed and anti-Semitism itself could disappear".</p>

<h1>Random stuff</h1>

<ul>
<li>Realized that there were two Justinians. Justinian I was discussed in <em>Early Middle Ages</em>, but here it's Justinian II Rhinotmetos (noseless). He lost his nose after being overthrown and sent into exile, but then came back and became Emperor again!</li>
<li>Apparently splitting a man in twain by attaching his arms to two trees and felling them was a common penalty for adultery. Poetic Justice.</li>
<li>There was a Rus invasion of Constantinople in 860, which was also described in <em>Early Middle Ages</em>.</li>
<li>Koestler keeps talking about "Russian Chronicle". Apparently it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Chronicle">Nestor's letopis</a>.</li>
<li>Matthias Mieses is an oft-cited historian. Who was he? A German-only Wikipedia entry suggests he was a historian of Yiddish.</li>
<li>Interesting analysis from the evolution perspective of Jews in the ghetto effect of them. Three things: inbreeding, genetic drift, and selection pressure.</li>
<li>The Jews spoke so many languages in the past. Very flexible and dependent on the empire they found themselves in. Koestler presents a list.</li>
<li>Interesting observation from Koestler in final appendix of Thirteenth Tribe: in his estimation, the greatest Jewish contributions are not in Yiddish and Ladino, but in German, English, French.</li>
</ul>

<p>Koestler attempted to discourage misuse of his theory by hedging extensively in the conclusion, saying that Israel's right to exist is based on the UN mandate and not on Biblical covenants or genetic inheritance.</p>

<p>Sadly, Koestler's theory has been used extensively by Arab anti-Zionists, and white supremacists alike. Anyway, the first half is great, but the remainder can be safely skipped.</p>

<p>That all said, this Khazar question is historically fascinating, shrouded in mystery, and full of people on both sides, exhibiting classic motivated reasoning. We'll see where I eventually land.</p>

        <p>In my latest side project, I borrow a couple of ideas from evolution and apply
them to origami. Starting from a blank square apply a random crease, then again,
and again, and again. The result is completely new, never before seen origami
model! To make the process less random, pick your favorite next step from a set
of possibilities. <a href="https://borismus.github.io/evogami/evolve/">Try it out</a> and see what you can come up with.</p>

<p><style>

<p>I'm looking forward to folding some of the best Evogamis out of real paper! </p>

<h1>Constraints breed creativity</h1>

<p>Modern origami practitioners discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on
the paper. This leads to the abstract aesthetic of simple origami models.</p>

<p>Evogami is even more constrained than normal origami. We only allow one type of
fold, the humble valley fold. No pleats, rabbit ears, reverse folds, crimps,
squashes, sinks, or petal folds. Furthermore, this fold is done across a line,
which means that multiple disjoint segments of the current shape will be folded.
Constraints breed creativity!</p>

<h1>Evogami evolution details</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://borismus.github.io/evogami/evolve/">evolver</a> starts with a blank sheet of paper. Next, we
alternate a sequence of <strong>mutation</strong> and <strong>selection</strong> steps. Mutation is done
randomly by the computer, and selection is done by a human, based on their
taste. It goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Begin with a blank sheet of paper.</li>
<li><strong>Mutate</strong>: make 12 random creases.</li>
<li><strong>Select</strong>: the person picks an interesting direction of those presented.</li>
<li><strong>Mutate</strong>: the computer makes 11 new random creases on top of the selected
direction.</li>
<li><strong>Select</strong>: the person selects the next step, or they can decide that they are
satisfied and save this design.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Unexpected power use in the browser</h1>

<p>The evolver is minimal but powerful, especially in conjunction with a few
built-in browser primitives. Some judo moves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tap again: unsatisfied with your set of next evogami choices? Just tap the
same design again to re-generate the grid.</li>
<li>Back button: return to the previous step in your design. Easily undo this by
tapping the browser's forward button.</li>
<li>Reload button: the page regenerates a set of 12 new random evogami with the
same number of folds as the current generation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Inspiration and thanks</h1>

<p>I recently read <a href="/books/why-greatness-cannot-be-planned">Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned</a>, which uses
<a href="http://picbreeder.org">Picbreeder</a> to make many of its profound arguments. Picbreeder is
an evolution-inspired image generator that uses a complex gene-like encoding
called <a href="http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html">NEAT</a>. I wanted to play around with open-endedness too, but found
the mapping from the NEAT DNA to images to be unintuitive. In a sense, Evogami
is a simpler version of Picbreeder, with the great advantage that the resulting
output can be folded using real paper. </p>

<p>This project would have taken far longer without the impressive <a href="https://rabbitear.org/">Rabbit
Ear</a>, a powerful JavaScript library for doing origami design on the
web. Big thanks to <a href="https://robbykraft.com/">Robby, the maintainer</a>!</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by the interplay between ancient art and modern technology. Go
players have had their minds blown by unexpected and insightful moves produced
by AlphaGo. Computational approaches applied to origami created new art
pioneered by folks like <a href="https://langorigami.com/">Robert J. Lang</a>. </p>

<p>Can this approach yield original origami models that inspire the paper folding
world? 🗅</p>

      <div>
        <p>12 hours dedicated to the period from 300 to 1000 CE, often called the Dark Ages. The modern official nomenclature refers to the fact that sources on the time period are scarce. The lecturer distances from the colloquial usage of backwardness, decline, evil, etc. </p>

<h1>Late Rome</h1>

<p>Rome was in shambles around the third century. Wars with Persia, conflict with barbarians. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a> saw 50 emperors in 25 years!</p>

<p>Diocletian finally stabilized Rome by imposing authoritarian measures. He militarized Roman society, dismantled any vestiges of the old Roman republic, and split empire in Twain, taking the eastern Roman Empire for himself. The new structure involved an emperor (title Augustus) in the east and in the west, each paired with an understudy-successor (title Caesar). Diocletian thought he was pretty dope, and changed his title from Primus inter pares (first among equals) to Dominus (master).</p>

<p>Constantine converted to Christianity in 312 and many followed his lead, although Senators often held out and savored their pagan traditions. The only imperial attempt to revert to paganism by Julian the Apostate completely failed. He was the only pagan emperor after Constantine.</p>

<p>The transition from Rome to the Fall of Rome was varied depending on locale within the Roman empire. In many areas it was quite gradual. In Rome, the last emperor's deposition in 473 had no bearing on day to day life. Commerce was still done in Roman coins, barbarian peoples still enjoyed Roman traditions. </p>

<h2>St. Augustine and Early Christian thinking</h2>

<p>St. Augustine's life is a mirror through which to try to gleam religious morality of the period. He was first inspired by Manicheanism, later Neo-platonism, and finally developed original ideas that were the basis for rigid, early Christian doctrines.</p>

<p>Manichaeans: inspired by a Persian school. Good and evil is in perpetual gridlock, neither able to overpower the other.</p>

<p>Neo-platonists: God is everything and everything is good. Some things may appear evil, but that's just because God got distracted.</p>

<p>Athletes of God: not sure how widespread, but around 300 CE there were many famous cases of people turning to asceticism and other extremes in the name of worshipping the Christian God.</p>

<h2>Fall of Rome in the west</h2>

<p>These barbarian tribes took on a lot of Roman traditions and lifestyles. Many became practically indistinguishable from their Roman counterparts. </p>

<p>In England, a distant outpost of Rome, Christianity was lost well before the last emperor, along with literacy. Interesting example of regression in civilization.</p>

<p>Irish monks retained their Christianity and eventually settled in Britain, bringing their religion back to England. They were extremely serious in their interpretation of monastic life. Part of this was due to the fact that Anglia retained its Celtic language which was Germanic and very different from Latin. So studying the scriptures was substantially more difficult because of the language barrier. </p>

<p>When Irish monks exported their version of Catholicism to the world, including Italy and Spain, it was a hardened take on the subject. </p>

<h2>Rome in the east</h2>

<p>The eastern Roman empire lasted for a long time. Eventually it fell in 1453 due to largely to Arab invaders. The east diverged significantly after Diocletian split the empire in two. For example, it switched to Greek as the main language. </p>

<p>One of the most successful Byzantine emperors, Justinian made some attempts to reunite the empire, successfully conquering the North African Vandal kingdom. He made peace with the Persians in the east, establishing an “eternal treaty”. However just as he was attempting to reconquer Italy, the Persians break the treaty and invade from the east, sacking cities and gaining territories in Palestine and Syria. This misstep, as well as the appearance of the Plague of Justinian, put an end to Justinian's ambition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Plague of Justinian is the first and the best known outbreak of the first plague pandemic, which continued to recur until the middle of the 8th century. Some historians believe the first plague pandemic was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 15–100 million people during two centuries of recurrence, a death toll equivalent to 25–60% of Europe's population at the time of the first outbreak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Byzantine empire was constantly besieged by the Arabs from the south, by Persians from the east, and sometimes by Slavs and other barbarians from the north. Many attempts were made on Constantinople, including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(626)">joint siege</a> by Persian and Slav armies in 626.</p>

<h1>Francia after Rome</h1>

<p>As Rome was collapsing, The Franks established Frankia, a kingdom preceding modern France. Clovis I was the best known ruler of the Merovingian dynasty. This dynasty suffered from problems of succession. They split their inheritance between children, and due to bad luck had a long strain of many child-rulers. Eventually they lost control and were replaced by the Carolingians, initially Pippin II, but later Charles Martell (the hammer), who made significant gains pushing back against the invading Arabs. </p>

<h2>Iconoclasm</h2>

<p>The pope remained tied to the Byzantine empire for many centuries after last western Roman emperor. However, as the empire became increasingly besieged it was less capable and interested in protecting assets of the church. To raise money for a large army to defend against Muslims, the Byzantine emperor Leo III instituted a new tax. But since church interests were not being adequately protected, the pope refused to pay it. <em>History of the world viewed through the lens of taxes</em></p>

<p>Leo III then demanded destruction of holy icons, a core practice of the still unified church. It's pretty unclear why this happened, perhaps an attempt to emulate successful Islamic tradition? At any rate, the pope refused and eventually the papacy turned away from Byzantine and the East in general, so much that popes, who had long been from Greece, now weren’t sourced from there for 800 years. It's the dark ages, things are murky, but there's more speculation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Iconoclasm">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>This wasn’t quite the schism yet tho. That’s later. </p>

<p>The papacy found itself without protection. The Carolingians under Pippin III (son of Charles Martel) wanted to make their ascension legitimate and saw an opportunity. To officially depose the still Merovingian king, they struck a deal with the pope: legitimate us, and we will defend your interests against the Lombards in northern Italy. Thus did the church's power and attention shift towards the West.</p>

<h2>Charlemagne</h2>

<p>Charlemagne, Charles I, aka Charles Magnus, aka Charles the Great, was named after his grandfather Charles Martel, the hammer that successfully pushed back against many Arab invaders. Charlemagne eventually inherits the whole Carolingian empire, first splitting it with his brother Carloman. The names are really too much!</p>

<p>Charlemagne stands out as the greatest Carolingian, and reconquers more territory, including lands not originally in the Roman empire. He struggles much more against the Saxons than against the Lombards. The Saxons were primitive and distributed, actually consisting of many tiny tribes. Conversely, the Lombards were developed city dwellers with a capital city in Padua. Conquering the capital meant capitulation.</p>

<p>Does this generalize? Do we necessarily become less resilient as civilization progresses? Seems unlikely. <em>Distributed is more resilient</em></p>

<h2>Carolingian Renaissance</h2>

<p>Charlemagne's rule in the 9th century coincided with a golden age. </p>

<p>Latin at this point was just a wildly evolving colloquial language which was slowly evolving into French, Spanish and Italian, depending on the region.</p>

<p>Around this period, Irish and Anglosaxon missionaries were spreading their faith far and wide. When they landed in the Carolingian empire, they were distinguished by their classical Latin, which remained unadulterated by their main germanic tongue. These monks found inconsistencies between many versions of holy scriptures and sought to consolidate back to their purest form. Charlemagne too did not believe in divine omniscience and insisted on addressing God in proper Latin. </p>

<p>During this period, bishops became much better educated and much better stewards of the religion. Meanwhile priests remained unrefined. Priesthood tests involved with very basic questions about the faith and included an answer key, suggesting a low level of theological sophistication. Also interesting is the use of standardized testing for this purpose.</p>

<p>To help bring about more literacy the Carolingian Rennaisance is an early example of writing reform, helping usher in <em>Carolingian minuscule</em>, which introduced lower case letters, spaces between words, basic punctuation, and other hints to help make reading easier.</p>

<h2>Treaty of Verdun</h2>

<p>Carolingians and Merovingians both suffered from being too equitable in splitting inheritance along their heirs. This led to conflicts between the heirs often military and loss of stability. Charlemagne got "lucky", since by his death, all of his kids were dead except Louis the Pious. The Carolingian Rennaisance continued under his watch. But Louis' successors saw Carolingian power collapse. <em>Primogeniture and other methods of splitting inheritance</em></p>

<p>Louis the Pious declared his successors when he was just 40, decades before his death. His three sons quickly rebelled against him. After an extended kerfuffle involving Louis' imprisonment to a monastery on two separate occasions, an equilibrium was reached between his three surviving children: Lothair, the eldest controlled Middle Francia (approx. Italy). Louis, a younger son from the same marriage controlled East Francia (approx. Germany), and Charles, much younger and from another marriage, controlled West Francia (approx. France).</p>

<h1>Carolingian decomposition: France and Germany</h1>

<p>Under Charlemagne, the empire was subdivided into counties each governed by an appointed count, accountable to the emperor. This is a nice illustration of an anti-democratic principle at play, succinctly formulated by Fukuyama as <em>Higher political bodies should be answerable to lower ones not vice versa</em>. </p>

<p>As the Carolingian Empire succumbed to infighting and Viking invaders, Counts began to gain more power. To secure their alliance in war, Kings began to give Counts multiple counties. The office of Count became hereditary and no longer appointed. Counts, not Kings begin appointing local bishops and abbots, and creating their own law courts. This process is known as <em>Devolution of Power</em>. By 900 there are 30 principalities in West Francia, many of which prevented the King from even visiting. A similar process occurred in East Francia, but instead Dukes (a level above Count) retained power. As a result, the east was less fragmented, into about 5 Dutchies. </p>

<p>The West fragments fractally as Castellan do the same to their local Counts as what Counts did to Carolingian Kings. Under Charlemagne, Castellans were a public office, appointed by the ruler and non hereditary. But this breaks down as part of the process of devolution. These castelins assume titles of Dominus (Lord). Increasingly their castles are built of stone, not wood as before.</p>

<p>These lords then impose power in their realm, typically a 15 mile radius circle around the castle. To enforce their lordship, they hire Knights as mafia-like enforcers. Knights multiply in numbers, get fiefdoms, and we converge to feudalism.  </p>

<p>By this point, the King is effectively elected official, selected by Counts that hold the real power. This process of devolution is really interesting as a way of transforming a top-down hierarchy into one that turns bottom up, at least up to some rung. Clearly not all the way, since commoners, serfs and slaves were fully excluded from these power games. Does this apply to corporations in some way?</p>

<h1>Teutonicum / Germany</h1>

<p>TODO
OTTO
Holy Roman Empire</p>

<h1>Meanwhile in Spain/Al-Andalus</h1>

<p>Not taking too many notes here, since a lot of the material overlaps with <em>Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr</em>. The <em>Jizya tax</em> stood out as especially interesting, in the perverse incentives it created. If too many Christians and Jews converted to Islam, the Arab leaders would lose their tax base!</p>

<p>The visigoths in Spain were quickly overrun but Arab invaders, who established an Umayyad kingdom there, and eventually self-declared a Caliphate. </p>

<p>Initially a dusty outpost of the Islamic world, by the 10th century Al-Andalus became a significant, urbanized and diverse region in Europe. The capital at Cordoba dwarfed any other European centers, with population around 100-250k. In contrast, population of Paris at the time was perhaps 20k, and London perhaps 10k.</p>

<p>The Arabs brought with them irrigation techniques acquired to survive in harsh deserts, relying on gravity to relay water from Oases many tens of miles away. They also brought with them new crops like rice, sugar cane and cotton, which became staples of Spanish food, and instrumental in the New World. They brought a great amount of high culture, math, and astronomy, and the region became dominant so that contemporary European mathematicians like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II">Gerbert</a> would flock to Al-Andalus for access to the greatest minds of the time, as well as preserved writings of Greek philosophers. </p>

<h1>England</h1>

<p>Alfred the Great... zoned out a bit because it was mostly recap of <em>The Story of Medieval England</em>.</p>

<h2>From Slavery to Serfdom</h2>

<p>Fantastic historical perspective on serfdom as actually a substantial improvement to quality of life. </p>

<p>Roman latifundia were large estates controlled by wealthy romans. These were mostly tilled by agricultural slaves, acquired as war booty. These slaves have no rights at all, not even to their offspring or their spouses. They could not own anything at all and generally lived in terrrible conditions. </p>

<p>Estates would typically consist of one or both of these: 
1. The demesne (or domain) of the lord, which a serf is required to till some number of days a week for no pay.
2. The tenantship allotted to each serf, from which the lord gets a cut, but is fundamentally tied to the serf. Except if the serf dies childless, in which case posessions would revert to the lord by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortmain">Mortmain</a>.</p>

<p>By the 10th century, slavery is mostly gone, but it’s not fully rooted.</p>

<h1>Feudalism</h1>

<p>The feudal system based on lords and vassals was put in place around this same time. Vassals would swear fealty to their lords. This would grant them a fief, usually heritable property within their lord's holdings. In Latin, fief is feudum, from which feudalism comes from, and this is a central notion to the idea. In exchange for the fief, the vassal must come to the lord's aid in war, and generally give them advice when it is requested by the overlord. </p>

<p>(For some reason, this reminds me a lot of a corporate structure, where the fief is a steady salary, and the war is with the code.)</p>

<p>Family structure changed as a result of Christianity. Completely novel ideas came about, borrowing neither from Roman nor barbarism traditions, but driven more by the church. Two interesting examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prohibition of cousin marriage, up to 6th cousins! I can barely track my lineage that far.</li>
<li>Delegalizaton of concubinage, which apparently is not always as nefarious as it sounds. In Ancient Rome, concubinage "was an institution of quasi-marriage between Roman citizens who for various reasons did not want to enter into a full marriage".</li>
</ul>

<h1>Aside on technology</h1>

<h2>Knights</h2>

<p>Knights first emerged during the reign of Charlemagne. They relied on a few different technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stirrups</strong> from Central Asia enabled a much more stable ride. </li>
<li><strong>High backed saddles</strong> increased stability especially in case of frontal impact that would normally throw you backwards.</li>
<li><strong>Couching lances</strong>, meaning tucking a weighted spear under your arm as you charge. This put all of the horse's momentum into the spear tip for an extremely devastating blow. </li>
</ul>

<p>This is a fascinating general direction, see <em>Horse related inventions</em>.</p>

<h2>Viking longboats</h2>

<p>Vikings initially were great traders, establishing vast trade routes throughout the world. Archaeological digs at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helg%C3%B6">Helgo</a> recovered  Buddha statues from India dating to the 6th century. Eventually Viking traders turned into Viking raiders, conducting seasonal raids in the Carolingian empire and in Britain.</p>

<p>One of their secret weapons was the longboat, able to carry about 100 men with very shallow draft enabled transport of raiders over seas, but also critically, to enter rivers that would normally be inaccessible.</p>

<p>Vikings would often establish semi-permanent bases from which to conduct yearly raids on especially plentiful targets.</p>

<h1>Conclusion and some historiography</h1>

<p>The Dark Ages are shrouded in mystery but two famous historians devoted their lives to studying the period.</p>

<ul>
<li>Edward Gibbon wrote The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in 1776</li>
<li>Henri Pirenne was a Belgian historian, wrote Mohammed and Charlemagne in 1937.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gibbon attributed the fall of Rome to Christianity. On his analysis, the religion made Romans too laconic and insufficient concerned about this world, more concerned about the world to come. As a result, they could not muster up the energy to withstand barbarism incursions. This is unconvincing since he pegs collapse at the date of deposition of the last western emperor. Meanwhile the eastern Roman empire lasts another millennium. And it’s actually the more Christian half. </p>

<p>Pirenne doesn't accept that the Roman empire fell in the 5th century at all. He attributes eventual collapse to economic decline and the Arab invasions around the 8th century. </p>

<p>Daileader, the lecturer, has a better explanation: depopulation. Strangely, no symptoms of depopulation appear in any of the prior lectures. It's a bit odd to conclude with a completely new insight.</p>

<p>According to the lecturer, Roman population declined greatly between 2nd and 7th centuries, which led to inability to defend against various Euro-barbarians, Arabs, etc. There's apparently tons of archaeological evidence for this: declining sizes of cities as witnessed by receding city walls. Main reasons for the population decline may have been diseases: The Plague of Cyprian in the 3rd century CE, the Plague of Justinian in 6th century CE (first known occurence of Yersinia pestis, the Justinianic plague), and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/plagues-roman-empire/473862/">others</a>.</p>

<p>Gibbon and Pirenne saw Carolingian period as a low point in European history. Modern historians don't associate Dark Ages with a cultural darkness or decline, but a period lacking primary sources. Culturally and economically, the Carolingian Renaissance seems to have pushed Europe out of a decline, spurred on by exchanges with Vikings who had huge trade networks, and cultural interactions with Arabs who were just ramping up.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Another GB recommendation that I really enjoyed. It's hard to summarize this book succinctly since it is such a potpourri of different fields and ideas.</p>

<h1>A different lens on Evolution</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evolution is the ultimate treasure hunter, searching for nothing and finding everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evolution works under a constraint: whatever it produces must survive to reproduce. "Survival of the fittest" is the most popular conception of this process but does not capture any nuance. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem with competition as a general explanation for creativity is that it usually drives towards everything converging to the best. Selection is not really a creative force: It focuses and optimizes, and ultimately restricts exploration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forces at play in evolution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Competition doesn't actually increase interestingness, but enforces the constraint of genetic survival.</li>
<li>Genetic drift is the process by which frequency of alleles changes over time as a result of luck. If a given trait doesn’t affect an organism’s ability to survive or reproduce (for example, the color of an organism’s bones), then natural selection will not direct that trait in one way or another, and its evolution will instead drift. </li>
<li>Exaptation is the process of co-option of an evolved ability to do something else. For example, feathers first evolved in dinosaurs, where they helped to regulate temperature. Only later did evolution exploit them as a stepping stone to flight. </li>
<li>Niche finding is a way to shield an organism from competition. If an organism can make a living in a new way, then it has effectively founded its own niche. A new niche often makes founding newer niches possible, and such newer niches often lead to even newer ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>As much as I disliked <em>Finite and Infinite Games</em>, this discussion of evolution reminds me of it a bit. The only goal of an infinite game is to keep playing.</p>

<p>In an interesting twist, even our human inventions can be considered an evolutionary process since they were created by us, the products of evolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line is that many of our greatest engineering aspirations—such as flight, solar power, artificial intelligence—were not the explicit objective of evolution, though it created all of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Invention and stepping stones</h1>

<p>A key metaphor often used to explain non-objective search processes is that of crossing a lake using stepping stones in dense fog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of the fog, you don’t know where either path leads. For all you know, one might lead you to a dead end while the other eventually might reach the other side of the lake. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dense fog is a great metaphor for <em>Bounded rationality</em>. The stepping stones are a good metaphor for the idea of the <em>Adjacent possible</em>. Each stepping stone must also be stable to support your weight as you cross, which is a great metaphor for <em>Stable intermediate forms</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we really behave as treasure hunters and stepping stone collectors, then the only important thing about a stepping stone is that it leads to more stepping stones, period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors make sweeping claims like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Profiles of the Future</em> makes a distinction between expected and unexpected inventions. This book's framework applies most clearly to unexpected inventions (eg. nuclear energy). These unexpected inventions are shrouded by fog. They are too many stepping stones away to be seen. </p>

<p>Expected inventions (eg. flying machines) fall less neatly into this metaphor. They are like hills above the fog, but you can't quite figure out the path to get there. On the other hand, once you get close enough to that hill, something that was completely out of reach becomes attainable.</p>

<p>This idea of invention as a process of groping for the next stone in the dense fog makes it clear that learnings from the history of science are inherently limited. Again that McLuhan quote about walking backwards into the future comes to mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, great inventors don’t peer into the distant future. A false visionary might try to look past the horizon, but a true innovator looks nearby for the next stepping stone. The successful inventor asks where we can get from here rather than how we can get there. It’s a subtle yet profound difference. Instead of wasting effort on far-off grandiose visions, they concentrate on the edge of what’s possible today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me of my <em>Asimov's Tech Tree</em> project, and that I really should re-think it as follows. Consider an impactful modern invention and work backwards through all of the inventions its inventors were inspired by. Then repeat this process, creating a tree culminating in this invention. This view would serve to illustrate the many surprising new horizons that one invention enables. Examples include the way that looms and vacuum tubes lead to computers, and smartphones led to better batteries, and better batteries led to electric cars. Authors included a few other uncited example I found interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the space race yielded innovations like cochlear implants, memory foam mattresses, freeze-dried food, and improved emergency blankets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In many cases, the inventor is driven by a search for the interesting and novel. Art often follows this pattern too, since it is more often done for its own sake. This is a very fluid process involving a lot of gut feeling, hunches and intuition. As many inventors do this, the process compounds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The important point is that novelty (and interestingness) can compound over time by continually making new things possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Picbreeder and other open-ended search applications</h1>

<p>The authors rely mostly on Picbreeder, but also on other projects from their research on open-endedness to make their point, which can be boiled down to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more troubling lesson is that objective-driven search is sometimes embarrassingly incompetent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They built a walking robot simulator and compared optimization to open-ended search. They found that the robot that tried to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply tried to do something novel again and again. They explain it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Falling down and kicking your legs may be a better stepping stone than trying to take a step (because kicking your legs is the foundation of oscillation, which is how walking works), but if walking is the objective, falling down is considered one of the worst things you can do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They built a maze solver which would take considerably longer to solve mazes that were deceptive, meaning that they had deliberate dead-ends.</p>

<p>Images in <a href="http://picbreeder.org/">Picbreeder</a> are generated from a DNA-like code which can <em>mutate</em> to create a different but related images. Following the evolution analogy, visitors to the website can vote on images as a form of <em>selection</em>. </p>

<p>I did something similar with <em>Evogami</em>, but with a much simpler mapping from DNA to object.</p>

<p>These examples are all really neat, but all deal with very specific domains: simulated walking robots, mazes, images, simulated paper. How to go from these narrow fields to something as all-encompassing as evolution remains unclear to me.</p>

<h1>Evolution tends towards complexity</h1>

<p>The authors pose a good question: if single celled bacteria can do the job of reproducing, why bother creating more complex offspring?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all organisms begin their life as single cells and end up reproducing to create offspring who also start as single cells—and this simple strategy for reproduction is effective—what objective utility is there in doing the same thing, but in more and more complicated ways?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By viewing evolution as an open-ended search process, you end up with complexity necessarily.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Stephen Jay Gould has pointed out in evolution, once all the simple ways to live are exhausted, the only way to create a new species or niche is to become more complex</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Strange vibes and nitpicks</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a sense, over eons our bodies have become a kind of encyclopedia of facts about the universe in which they exist. Eyes represent the presence of light in the universe. Ears signify mechanical vibration. Legs are reflections of gravity, and lungs of oxygen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is suspicious. Most organs in the body are pretty mysterious from this perspective. </p>

<p>A lot of this book rails against <em>Perils of optimization</em> and warns about maximizing meaningless metrics, along the lines of the <em>McNamara Fallacy - choose meaningful metrics</em> and the infamous cobra breeding story associated with <em>Goodhart's law - indicators will be gamed</em>. This reminds me a lot of Illich and the <em>Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization</em> discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America: school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, anything that a politician can run on, anything that someone can get a promotion on. And as soon as you invent that statistical category, fifty people in that institution will be at work trying to figure out a way to make it look as if progress is occurring when actually none is.</p>

    <title>How to Take Smart Notes</title>

        <p>Zettelkasten Method, In Praise of Niklas Luhmann, or Ode To The Slip-box.</p>

<p>The Roam cult sprang out of a practice called Zettelkasten. I refuse to join the cult, but see great value in cross-linked note taking practice. So far my tool of choice is Obsidian, mainly because I like plaintext. This book introduces the Zettel method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not possible to think systematically without writing - Niklas Luhmann</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tools for your own thoughts</strong>: Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” “No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.”</p>

<p><strong>A mirror of your brain</strong>: These notes are not meant for external consumption. They are meant to be a reflection and formalization of your thoughts. As you think about a topic, your mental model of the topic evolves, as does this collection of interlinked notes. Even if your memory fades, you can return to your notes and continue where you left off.</p>

<p><strong>A communication partner</strong>: The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to?</p>

<p><strong>Integrate seemingly unrelated sources</strong>: This is especially powerful as a way to integrate learnings from multiple sources into one place. "When we turn to the slip-box, its inner connectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts." Read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.</p>

<p><strong>Same format, same place</strong>: Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. No underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. Write brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. </p>

<p><strong>Keep notes short</strong>: By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling. This will also allow for more ready interconnections.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid premature linearization</strong>: ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” Prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes achieves the opposite of what teachers intend to do. The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. </p>

<p><strong>Feedback loops emerge</strong>: The addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas. The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. It is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Take it slow</strong>: it takes time to evolve any idea, and this is another benefit of the slip-box. Related to <em>Slow hunch</em>. Taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place.</p>

<p><strong>Work on many ideas in parallel</strong>: Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Don't force a direction</strong>: Luhmann’s answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Publishing by finding a path in the graph</strong>: once you have this densely linked note cloud, and you want to cobble together an idea for others to consume, you weave a path through your graph and create a linear narrative. "We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts."</p>

<p>Three kinds of notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Temporary notes: which are designed to be processed and converted into something more permanent.</li>
<li>Permanent notes: (aka Matuschak's Evergreen Notes) contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way.</li>
<li>Project notes: project specific, should theoretically be kept in a separate place.</li>
</ol>

<p>General reasons for keeping notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two.</a></li>
<li>Zeigarnik effect</li>
<li>Charles Darwin forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories.</li>
<li>Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it. Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that’s important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both … The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” - Jeremy Dean</p>

    <title>Thinking in Systems: A Primer</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/thinking-in-systems-a-primer"/>

        <p>Thanks to a book club at work, I finally read this legendary book.</p>

<p>A system is a set of entities interconnected to produce behavior over time in response to external events. For example, a slinky's behavior lies within the slinky itself. </p>

<p>Modernist thinking tends to like simple causal connections. However reality is complex. Systems thinking is an interesting and valuable lens that complements high modernism. </p>

<p>One way of looking at systems thinking is as a formalization of folk wisdom:</p>

<ul>
<li>a stitch in time saves nine</li>
<li>the rich get richer, the poor get poorer</li>
<li>don't put all of your eggs in one basket</li>
</ul>

<h1>What are systems?</h1>

<p>Systems have:</p>

<ul>
<li>discrete parts</li>
<li>parts that interact with one another</li>
<li>parts which together produce an effect that is different than each interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>“You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand “and.” - Sufi teaching story</p>

<p>System components in order of importance:</p>

<ul>
<li>purpose / function</li>
<li>interconnections </li>
<li>elements (often interchangeable, eg. employees)</li>
</ul>

<p>Systems are composed of stocks and of flows. Stocks are the amount of a thing. Flows are the increases or decreases of said thing. Think of a bathtub with a faucet and a drain. The water in the bathtub is the stock. The faucet is the flow of water in. The drain is the flow of water out. Flows can change quickly: you can shut on and off the faucet, plug the drain. Stocks change slowly and act as buffers: even if you open the drain completely, it will still take a minute for the water to vanish.</p>

<p>Types of feedback loops:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amplifying feedback loop: the more stock there is, the higher the flow.</li>
<li>Balancing feedback loop: attempts to move stock to a desired state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Real world systems are affected by multiple feedback loops simultaneously.</p>

<h1>One stock systems</h1>

<h2>Two balancing loops (eg. Thermostat)</h2>

<p>Stock: temperature.
1. Balancing 1: Exterior temperature cools the room to be the same temperature as outside, flow is tempered by insulation, air gaps, etc.
2. Balancing 2: Heater warms the room until it is the temperature set on the thermostat.</p>

<h2>One amplifying and one balancing loop (eg. Population Growth)</h2>

<p>Stock: population.
1. Amplifying: the more people there are, the more people are born. 
2. Balancing: people don't live forever. There's a death rate.</p>

<p>Ultimate behavior will depend on which of the two dominates. If reinforcing dominates, end up with exponential growth. Many other examples like this, such as capital growth, where the more capital you have, the more you can make, but there's also depreciation costs.</p>

<h1>Two stock systems</h1>

<h2>Renewable stock constrained by non-renewable stock  (eg. Coal Mining)</h2>

<p>Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.</p>

<p>Stock 2: Coal.
1. Balancing: as the coal mine depletes, it becomes harder to extract the last bits of coal. </p>

<h2>Renewable stock backed by renewable resource (eg. Fishing)</h2>

<p>Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.</p>

<p>Stock 2: Fish.
1. Amplifying: the more fish there are, the more fish are born.
2. Balancing: as the population dwindles, it becomes harder to find the last fish. </p>

<h1>Great insights</h1>

<p><strong>Constrained by stocks vs. flows</strong>: non-renewable resources are constrained by stocks. Renewable resources are constrained by flows. </p>

<p><strong>Stocks act as buffers</strong>: rivers often flood because flow &gt;&gt; stock. Lakes rarely do because flow &lt;&lt; stock. </p>

<p><strong>Delays really matter</strong> in reality many of these loops are driven by information that is delayed. This results in oscillations.</p>

<p><strong>Stable intermediate forms</strong>: another important concept.  Hierarchies mean that there are independent sub-systems which are independently stable. This enables a rise in complexity. </p>

<p><strong>Limiting factors</strong> are an intuitive but important idea. A systems is affected by the stock that is in least supply. As a system grows, the most limiting stock may change. </p>

<p><strong>Resilience involves many balancing loops</strong>, most of which are inactive most of the time. Example: under normal circumstances, you don't sweat or shiver. But without these abilities you would be far less resilient.</p>

<p><strong>Dominant loops</strong> complex systems are made of multiple feedback loops, and which loop dominates the others makes a big difference. For example, in a population grouwth system, if the amplifying loop dominates, the population will grow exponentially, but if the balancing loop dominates, it will shrink.</p>

<h1>Stray thoughts</h1>

<p>Firstly, what a great collection of insights! But to call it a coherent book is a bit generous. I feel like it's not well structured, and found myself picking out nuggets rather than being swept away by a coherent narrative.</p>

<p>It’s hard to understand as an audio book. Need visual and ideally interactive diagrams. </p>

<p>Systems thinking is a great technique for CEOs, businessmen, macroeconomists. It's less clear how a pleb like me might apply it. But it's still interesting!</p>

<p>It would be worthwhile to contrast the causal diagrams of the sort Judea Pearl champions with these systems feedback loop diagrams.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Praise ignorance, for what man has not encountered he has not destroyed. - Wendell Berry</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Traps and remedies</h1>

<p>Systems have common failure modes. Here are some of the ones I found novel. The remedies are often easier said than done.</p>

<p><strong>Policy resistance</strong>. many actors are all invested in an equilibrium involving one stock. Each pulls the supply up and down to their own benefit. Everyone exerts a lot of effort but achieves little. 
Remedy: let go. Find another thing all parties can agree on. </p>

<p><strong>Tragedy of the commons</strong>, a common resource or sink is overused by each user, leading to ultimate ruin because of erosion effects. The term was coined much later than I thought: in 1968. 
Remedy: either apply pressure appealing to morality/decency/religion, split and privatize the commons, or impose penalties for overuse.  </p>

<p><strong>Drift to low performance</strong>, a gradual degradation in quality because of a moving performance goal. If quality is under the bar, the bar is set lower, often excused by sentiment like "it's not that much worse than last year", etc.
Remedy: Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Invert the pattern and set up a drift toward high performance.</p>

<p><strong>Escalation</strong>. Cycles of violence in conflicts between countries. Negative political ad campaigns that render both candidates unpalatable.
Remedy: disarmament. This can be unilateral or mutually agreed upon, but the latter requires mediation. </p>

<p><strong>Success to the successful</strong> is a common situation. The more money you have, the more of it you can make through investments, etc. 
Remedy: Jubilee? Potlatch? Antitrust laws? Estate taxes?</p>

<p><strong>Dependence</strong>, including personal addiction, but many other things. Societal dependence on institutions like healthcare, etc. 
Remedy: focus on long-term restructuring rather than short-term relief.</p>

<p><strong>Rule beating</strong>. Example: spending all available budget just to ensure that next years isn’t reduced. Example: only slowing down if there's a police car nearby.
Remedy: redesign the rules!</p>

<p><strong>Wrong goal</strong>, a common situation where a system pursues a goal that does not actually reflect desired outcomes. Reminds a lot of <em>McNamara Fallacy</em>
Remedy: </p>

<h1>Leverage points</h1>

<p>Most attributes of the system are effectively immutable. Structure of the flows is often physical. Delays are often unavoidable. Information flows in feedback systems are where most leverage lies.  </p>

<p>Unbridled growth with an amplifying loop is rare because such systems quickly lead to either:
- Exhaustion of resources (eg. No more bodies to infect)
- Balancing loop dominates (eg. Greater precautions and PPE)</p>

<p><strong>Slowing growth may bring stability to a system</strong>. Reminds me of <a href="https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1357764199015849984">this tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every hundred people telling us to "just install more solar panels", only one person will consider ways to reduce power usage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Make invisible information visible</strong>. During the oil embargo in 1970, the Dutch began to pay attention to power consumption. Some houses mysteriously seemed to use 30% less power than others. The difference was in location of the power meter. Those with low power usage had meter in the lobby. Others had the meter in the basement.</p>

<p><strong>Re-write the rules</strong>. Interventions into the system's rules are very effective. This explains why lobbyists are powerful. </p>

<p><strong>Encourage self organization</strong>: allowing a system to self organize is extremely powerful. But this may lead to unknown conclusions, so is not well loved by those in power. </p>

<p><strong>Goals matter</strong>. What is the ultimate goal of the system? What’s the goal of goog? What’s the priority order of many competing goals? Sometimes a leader can do this. Hitler profoundly changed the goals of Germany in the 1930s. Reagan changed the American ethos from “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.” to “Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” - St Exupery</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Paradigm shifts and meta paradigm awareness</strong>. We live in a world with many unstated assumptions, hidden goals, biases. Changing these is the higest leverage point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”</p>

    <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Memoir!</title>

        <p>MJ recommended I pick up this book. I regret nothing. </p>

<p>This was a fun look into game development history, narrated by a venerable insider. I remember spending days with AK and MN playing Civ 1 in the mid-90s, and have played every game in the series since.</p>

<p>Billed as a memoir, this book focuses on anecdotes about the games and the game industry, with Sid Meier's personal life taking the backseat. I especially enjoyed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi">Nuclear Gandhi</a> story. It's such a colorful intersection of a funny premise, computer science, and a hoax.</p>

<p>Sid Meier's taste for non-violent educational simulators is especially compelling, and reading about these games made me really miss them. As a kid, I think Civ sparked my interest in history and war and complex systems. But I was mainly just having a lot of fun! These days playing even one game of Civ is a heavy lift, but maybe it's worth giving Civ Revolutions a look? </p>

<p>What I loved most about this book was how excited I became about building games again. The intersection of games and education is extremely tricky to pull off, and I would argue that edutainment as a genre has largely failed. The holy grail is to build something that plays like a game, but whets your appetite about something insightful. This is in some sense the opposite of what explorable explanations do, which are often more interactive visualizations than games.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either - Marshal McLuhan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing the book lacked was specific learnings and insights into game development. The chapter on the failed dinosaur game came closest, but I would have loved a whole book on this. Here are some final notes:</p>

<p><strong>Follow your interests</strong>: Sid Meier's games have been driven by his personal interests, at least in retrospect. </p>

<p><strong>People hate randomness</strong>: To placate people's busted sense of randomness and overdeveloped sense of fairness, Civ Revolutions had to implement some interesting decisions: any 3:1 battle in favor of human became a guaranteed win. Too many randomly bad outcomes in a row were mitigated.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback is fact</strong>: If a player is frustrated, this is a fact. It's not just their opinion! If a game is not fun, this is a fact the developer needs to contend with.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting decisions</strong>: Many of Meier's games rely heavily on decision making. The decisions must be interesting. 'I wonder what would happen next time, if I did it differently?'</p>

        <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year again! Following <a href="/notes/2019/article-highlights-of-2019/">last year's
summary</a>, here were my top reads for
2020. Last year I vowed to read fewer articles because they felt way more junky
than books do. I haven't changed my mind on this matter, but I was compelled to
try to understand this especially unusual year.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1>Education</h1>

<ul>
<li>An elite private school in Sydney, Australia, the alma mater of three prime ministers, banned laptops in 2016 and required students to handwrite essays through the tenth grade: the headmaster said the school found money spent on interactive white boards, laptops, and the associated software was a total waste. <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/">Rotten STEM: How Technology Corrupts Education</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21051869/indoor-air-pollution-student-achievement">Installing Air Filters in Classrooms Has Surprisingly Large Educational Benefits</a></li>
<li>The best methods are therefore those that supply comprehensible input in low anxiety situations, containing messages that students really want to hear. These methods do not force early production in the second language. <a href="https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html">Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Invention</h1>

<ul>
<li>Consolidation. Today’s cloud and mobile companies — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google — may very well be the GM, Ford, and Chrysler of the 21st century. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/">The End of the Beginning</a></li>
<li>Saul Griffith remains impressive. <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20100201/saul-griffiths-house-of-cool-ideas.html">Saul Griffith's House of Cool Ideas</a></li>
<li>What if the government bought the most valuable patents from its inventors, thus unlocking whole industries for more innovation? Main problem is how to price them. <a href="https://www.tenentrepreneurs.org/blog/innovation-eyes-on-the-prize">Innovation: Eyes on the Prize</a></li>
<li>More and more online activity is sinking into the cozyweb (away from public internet). <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">The Extended Internet Universe</a></li>
<li>We overestimate the impact of technological progress but underestimate the impact of cultural and social shifts. <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/65/in-plain-sight/why-futurism-has-a-cultural-blindspot-rp">Why Futurism Has a Cultural Blindspot</a></li>
<li>Unimportant problems are often more fun to work on, and ultimately you never know how important they really are. <a href="http://yosefk.com/blog/work-on-unimportant-problems.html">Work on unimportant problems</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Self help</h1>

<ul>
<li>A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier. <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/">68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice</a></li>
<li>When a difficulty comes your way, you should feel proud and excited, like “a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck.” <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/how-to-be-a-stoic">How to Be a Stoic</a></li>
<li>Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">What You'll Wish You'd Known</a></li>
<li>Rationality used to be this capacious concept that included reasonableness, but no longer. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/20/21068423/rationality-behavioral-economics-psychology-reasonable-decisions">Is rationality overrated?</a></li>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Originally written in 1960, I’m reading the edition revised in 1977. Clarke begins by reflecting on the last few decades and observing that although there were many important and expected inventions (eg. automobiles, planes, submarines, and spaceships), many of the most important were completely unexpected (eg. X-rays, nuclear energy, radio and television, electronics, and photography).</p>

<p>Clarke sets out not to predict the future but to outline a range of possible futures. This approach is a sibling to scenario planning, and is more hedgy and humble. But the real value I got from reading this book was to get a sense for a 1960s umwelt seen through a futurist’s eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Even a highly complex object could be completely specified on a modest amount of recording medium; you can put the Ninth Symphony on a few hundred feet of tape”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Clarke's Three Laws:</h2>

<ol>
<li>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is probably wrong.</li>
<li>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture past them into the impossible. </li>
<li>Any sufficiently advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic. </li>
</ol>

<h2>On the importance of Frontiers</h2>

<p>Clarke says the American frontier opened in 1492 and closed in 1869 with the completion of the western railroad. There are no new frontiers on earth, he says, since Mariana’s trench was visited. Now the frontier is space!!!</p>

<p>He emphasizes the importance of frontiers, both for physical resource harvesting, and for the soul. And he compares our existence on earth to being in a sensory deprivation chamber. Also cites lots of different benefits to frontier life. Toynbee claimed that the most productive and interesting work happens on frontiers, and that a civilization can be measured by how well their frontier does. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peoples occupying frontier positions, exposed to constant attack, achieve a more brilliant development than their neighbors in more sheltered positions. -Toynbee </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is definitely thought provoking, and not the first time the appeal of frontiers has crossed my mind. Almost 50 years later, I think are many interesting frontiers beyond pure geography. And space seems like the wrong focus given how many problems we face at home, the difficulties associated with space travel, and hostility of destinations. </p>

<p>That said, this doesn't quite feel satisfying. Possibly because having one frontier that is all encompassing is what one thinks of as frontier living. One thinks of early new world settlers or western expansion or Israeli settlers. </p>

<h2>Global TV (aka Internet)</h2>

<p>Interesting timing, with StarLink being so in vogue here in 2020. This was originally written before Telstar (an early comma satellite launched in 1962).</p>

<p>Reminder that long range radio is not possible without an atmosphere. On earth, the ionosphere enables longer wavelength terrestrial broadcasts. Short wave radio will pass through directly into space. </p>

<p>Broadcast TV is apparently confined to very short wave radio, so doesn’t transmit well over long distances. Clarke asks what it would take to have a trans-Atlantic TV station and proposes a chain of broadcast ships to act as relays. This is a bit bizarre. Were there no transatlantic cables at the time of writing? Surely transatlantic telegraphy depended on such infrastructure.</p>

<p>Clarke gets really excited about the possibility of using a satellite relay to enable global TV stations. Imagine getting TV from Moscow!! Funny to read this in an age of ubiquitous internet, but we really did get here. Prescient for its time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All men will become neighbours, whether they like it or not. Any form of censorship, political or otherwise, would be impossible. to jam signals coming from the heavens is almost as difficult as blocking the light of the stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important and highly relevant today. Indeed StarLink could technically be such a turning point. In such a world, how would China block websites?</p>

<p>Clarke makes an emphasis on the importance of this “global TV” possibility, but his assessment is very colored by Cold War specifics. He considers a scenario in which the Soviets launch a satellite above Asia, providing a dedicated propaganda machine to otherwise backwards people. “The TV satellite is mightier than the ICBM, and intercontinental TV (read: the internet) may be the ultimate weapon.” </p>

<p>Lots of prescient stuff about comms, much of which happened only recently, or is in the process of occurring, while anticipating that “perils and disadvantages are obvious; there are no wholly beneficial inventions”</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightweight prediction of smartphones</li>
<li>GPS and personal location</li>
<li>Difficulty of escaping friends and family</li>
<li>Video calls and their eventual effect on commuting (just happening now)</li>
<li>Remote work, with businesses “run by executives who are scarcely ever in each other’s physical presence”</li>
<li>Freedom of location “captains of industry of the 21st century may live where they please, running their affairs through computer keyboards”, sometimes opting for a “more personal touch... via wide-screen full-color TV”</li>
<li>“Orbital post office”, making airmail obsolete, (funny, you’d still go to a post office to make this happen — personal computing isn’t on the radar)</li>
<li>the demise of print media, and a real threat to newspaper model, but doesn’t quite go so far as to predict personalization, and again social media is not on the horizon at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s fascinating to see these predictions which are often so right (eg. Digital trends), but also so wrong (eg. We aren’t relying on satellite links, but only underground/underwater cables)</p>

<p>While Clarke acknowledges that “there are no wholly beneficial inventions”, he’s pretty optimistic that the world will converge onto one truth, and that “global TV” will lead to a reduction in ignorance. He does hedge his position: any futurist must be optimistic. At the same time, he does permit for some bad outcomes: “do we have the imagination and the statesmanship to use this new tool for the benefit of all mankind? Or will it be used merely to peddle detergents and propaganda?” </p>

<p>A call to action: “we are becoming a race of watchers, not a race of doers. The miraculous powers that a re yet to come may well prove more than our self-discipline can withstand.” — indeed this may still be our undoing. And Clarke didn’t even think of the impact of video games.</p>

<h2>Transportation</h2>

<p>Clarke over-indexes on a bunch of trendy technology of his time. How could he not? Things like Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) and Ground Effect Machines (GEM) take whole sections of the book. That said, GEM are pretty cool, and completely unknown by me. I went down a bit of a rabbit hole here on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lun-class_ekranoplan">Soviet ekranoplans</a>, which are super dope. Honestly I’m shocked that I hadn’t previously come across this, given so many overlapping interests: Soviet Russia, Hydrofoils, and History of Tech.</p>

<p><strong>Super-horse</strong>: Clarke has a bizarre level of respect for the horse, and projects some strange future which never came to pass in which a genetically engineered super-horse would be extra strong and smart and function essentially like a self-driving car.</p>

<p><strong>Hypersonic transport</strong>: Clarke cites an aeronautical engineer from 1929 who provided funny in retrospect limits to aircrafts in 1980: 130mph, a range of 600mi, payload of 4 tons and total weight of 20. Sure enough progress from 1929 to 1977 proved that engineer wrong. But Clarke did not realize that we were on the slowing part of the S-curve there, and seems to have no realization of the S-curve model at all, projecting exponential growth on all fronts. </p>

<p><strong>Fast walkways</strong>: Clarke covers a lot of ground, dishing out ideas left and right. He suggests a variable speed conveyor walkway with a very fast express lane, as in Moving Ways by H.  G. wells. He brings up large submerged “sausages” for transporting goods over water without creating any wave related friction, citing Frank Herbert “Dragon in the Sea”. Could be a fun read.</p>

<p><strong>GEVs</strong>: Wildly optimistic about this new unproven technology, going to far as to suggest that highways (which are expensive to build) will become obsolete by 1990 because everyone will be driving a hovercraft. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There will be a very difficult transition period before the characteristic road sign of the 1990s becomes universal: no wheeled vehicles on this highway”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general there is little regard for efficiency or any sort of power consumption calculations. There is no respect for the wheel, or things like rolling friction etc. Shocking for a scientist. But he is a good science fiction thinker. Ports are obsolete! Sam Francisco? Forget it. Switzerland will be a great shipbuilding nation. TODO: Look into why GEMs ultimately did not make inroads anywhere. Suspect it's energy related. </p>

<h2>Energy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Future fusion plants will be huge, but Clarke seems convinced they are coming soon. He’s very optimistic about nuclear. Sad to see that this dream remains a dream today, and has not panned out.</li>
<li>Urgent need for batteries seems prescient for 1970s.
<ul>
<li>TODO: How much has battery tech improved? Has someone done an analysis of (Ah or Wh / $)? Similar studies for <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/10567/the-cost-of-light-through-the-ages/">declining cost of light</a> (“how long you had to work for an hour of light”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wireless power seems to be too inefficient to be practical. Although there are wireless power projects today and extremely low power electronics Clarke couldn’t have anticipated.</li>
<li>Pessimistic about solar power. 
<ul>
<li>TODO: is there a similar analysis for the cost of solar? Clarke cites a 1 horsepower / square yard of sunlight theoretical max on a sunny day. Has that changed? Has the efficiency (10%) changed? How much has price changed? (my guess: a lot)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enumerates a bunch of alternative energy sources but neglects to mention wind power at all! Shocker.</li>
<li>Moon/asteroid mining is appealing because gravitational forces for leaving the exploited mine are so small (relative mass of earth is huge)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mind, body and machine problems</h2>

<p>Clarke speculates a lot about the future of brain, body, and the obsolescence of man.</p>

<p>Personally, I find these speculations to be intellectually interesting but viscerally terrifying and still technologically likely far fetched. I’m more inclined to care about augmentation, where computers can work to improve people’s abilities, rather than completely replace them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of speculation about how we might be able to perceive the way that animals perceive.</li>
<li>Synthetic brain stimulation, in part to create a “mechanical stimulator” so that you can “learn Kung fu, matrix style”.</li>
<li>Sleep: more questions than answers in this field. Do we need it? How much little can get away with?
<ul>
<li>Ridiculous thing about “electric sleep apparatus”, and the footnote that indicates that a large number of readers wrote him to inquire within.</li>
<li>Induced hibernation for long range space travel. Is this possible?</li>
<li>TODO: Do dolphins really not need sleep?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Immortality and consciousness uploading.
<ul>
<li>Can you upload your mind into a machine? (Meh)</li>
<li>“In adolescence we leave our childhood behind; one day there may be a second and more portentous adolescence, when we bid farewell to the flesh” (Unappealing)</li>
<li>Evolution is too slow, and we’ve conquered it. So let’s consider the real thing that will drive progress: machines. This is a tired argument, and I think enough progress has been made since the 60s, and enough barriers remain that this chapter feels quite obsolete.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarke scoffs at the quality of our biological senses, laughing at the narrow field of focus of the eye, minuscule compared to any camera lens out there. “No camera ever built — even the cheapest — has as poor an optical performance as this”, and he doubles down: let’s not make a virtue of a necessity”. He pities evolution, which “has performed a truly incredible job against fantastic odds”.</li>
</ul>

<p>My take is that we’ve made tons of progress in fields like AI and new fields like Machine Learning. It’s pretty clear to me that we are dealing with a different kind of intelligence, and not necessarily a continuum of intelligences.</p>

<p>My view is that we don’t understand the trade offs and the complexity of the system at hand. I suspect a lot of the design trade-offs exist because of factors not considered in Clarke’s analysis, or in a purely utilitarian short term view. Evolution cares about long term resilience more than anything else. I suspect the reason we exist today is because of the persistent forces of selection and mutation. Our form of life doesn’t need Titanium and rare earth metals to exist. If we did manage to replace our species with robots free of our “defective” eyes and ears, how long would such “M. Sapiens” species survive? Who knows, but I invoke Chesterton’s Fence. There are forces way beyond our current levels of understanding to even begin contemplating fucking with this system. Clarke’s arguments that the constant rebuilding of ourself is a problem completely ignores resilience of any sort.</p>

<h2>Half-baked and extremely speculative sections</h2>

<p>One downside of this book was the persistence of much wild and baseless speculation about anti gravity.</p>

<p><strong>Scaling</strong> Surprising overlap with Scale by Geoff West, this book greatly precedes it, but is another popularization of some of the scaling laws proposed earlier. In particular, he dwells on the incongruities of human sized ants, pint sized humans, etc. Strangely, he calls the whole chapter Lilliputian, citing Swift a lot. It’s hokey, but I think the classics were more deeply ingrained in popular culture at the time. Clarke makes additional arguments about intelligence being linked to the number of neurons in a brain, a scaling argument I don’t remember reading about before. So he denies the possibility of extremely intelligent small animals. But he is bullish on extremely intelligent, extremely large beings as those found in Swift’s Brobdingnag.</p>

<p><strong>Logical languages</strong> Clarke is pretty bullish on this idea that computers will change the way we communicate to be more logical, citing Loglan (now dead, via Lojban), and welcoming such a possibility. Obviously nothing of the sort has panned out. However computers have in some sense affected our communication, and made it more visual. This would have been extremely surprising and hard for Clarke to predict, but the ubiquity of Emoji has actually become a sort of surprising trend in global communication. Memes have really gained a lot of steam. Both these trends I think have brought visual communication to the masses in a way that has been unprecedented in history. Not to mention video (YouTube, TikTok) and audio (rise of Podcasts), as a force in mass communication.</p>

<p><strong>Climate engineering</strong> is mentioned in one final paragraph, as a possible direction Clarke could have written about. Of course the context for this would not be to try to curtail a warming climate, but instead for some lofty goal like having it rain less in Seattle because we’d like to go to the beach more often. Needless to say, the current state and dire projections for global climate were well beyond a futurist’s ability to predict from the ‘60s.</p>

<p><strong>Invisibility</strong> section is shockingly fluffy. Fourth dimension? Invisibility? All weird.</p>

<p><strong>Teleportation</strong>: Taking a very rationalist view here, he rejects the purely mental ability to teleport oneself, and considers the alternative, which is a Star Trek like instant cloning. Is this so obvious? The discussion predates the show. Analogies from duplicating audio and video signals turns out comically mechanistic, although he does acknowledge this. The bottom line is that having this form of teleportation technology seems practically impossible. And if it were possible, the ability to create infinite copies of a person would pose very large questions, far beyond transportation. </p>

<p><strong>Generalized Manufacturing</strong>: It takes Clarke a while to get to the point here, but similar to the teleportation chapter, he considers what it’d take to create a machine capable of cloning matter. Mostly the second order effects are outrageous: the end of factories, the end of farming, the end of raw goods transportation. The end of the author’s recollection of economies of scale! Every family would just synthesize whatever it needs on the spot. I guess the closest we’ve got so far are 3D printers and 3D scanners.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-gravity</strong>: Clarke does have some interesting speculation about how a gravity neutralizer could automatically be turned into a gravity drive. And then how this means that you could use “slingshot” techniques to gain an arbitrary amount of speed comfortably by exploiting gravity wells “gravity assist”. Also some off handed rejection of nuclear space and long range transport for safety reasons. Seems like this would require fission to be done safely? Maybe. </p>

<p><strong>Center of the earth</strong>: Not sure why we'd wanna do this. But I guess another frontier is center of Earth. Or really dense gas giants. Or like trying to land on the sun. Or a neutron star. Why do all this? The only reason appears to be for extracting natural resources.</p>

    <title>Dune by Frank Herbert</title>

      <div>
        <p>I first read Dune 20 years ago. Earlier in the year, excited by the upcoming movie, I read “Frank Herbert” by Tim O’Reilly, and my overall feeling was one of omission. And I thought that revisiting Dune would be illuminating. Re-reading books is not something I’ve done much of. I wish I had written notes on my first reading!</p>

<h2>What I remembered and what I forgot</h2>

<ul>
<li>I forgot much of the universe, which was both disappointing, and also entertaining in that many revelations were often unexpected. </li>
<li>I’d forgotten about the convoluted and intertwined relationships between House Harkonen and House Atreides. That Sardaukar is the name of a house is a revelation. And Paul's relation to Princess Irulan was also fascinating and unremembered. </li>
<li>Gurney Halleck and Thufir Hawat were largely forgotten.</li>
<li>Obviously the main characters were very familiar. Stilgar was surprisingly crisp in my memory, as was Duncan Idaho, who I remember having a much larger role (perhaps he does in subsequent books).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How my impression changed</h2>

<ul>
<li>Paul Atreides felt a lot more villainous to me now, perhaps colored by my recent reading of Frank Herbert. Earlier I remember basically being wholeheartedly in awe of him. Now I'm reticent. Paul Muad’dib is übermensch, reaching apex in too many domains to be humanly possible. Politically, inheriting duke and then in line to succeed the empire, spiritually as a living prophet, mentally as a proto-mentat and seer, physically as a vanquisher of foes in melee combat. And as a Fremen sand rider, capable of mounting legendarily large worms.</li>
<li>Leto Atreides has a much more outsized role in my mind compared to the short role he plays in the book. He is the unambiguous good character that I've personally identified as hero. Reminds me of my own father. </li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of Dune, it's very unclear that the author’s goal is to discredit hero worship. At this point you can't help but worship Pail Muad’dib yourself. Unless of course Herbert’s deliberate plan is to get the reader feeling what a Fremen zealot would feel, before tearing you down in the sequels.</p>

        <p>Written in relatively dry prose, this book packs a punch in few words. I found it similar in affect to <a href="/books/the-road-by-cormac-mccarthy/">The Road</a>, until remembering that this book is in a completely different genre. This is not speculative science fiction. It is an autobiography. That’s when the horror and depravity really hits home. </p>

    <title>Tools for Conviviality by Ivan Illich</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/tools-for-conviviality-by-ivan-illich"/>
    
    <updated>2020-10-25T09:00:00-00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>My main objection to <a href="/books/deschooling-society-by-ivan-illich">Deschooling Society</a> was that Illich completely neglected the babysitting aspect of the institution. With that out the window, feels like a reread is in order. However, I donated Deschooling to the LFL at work, but happened to have a copy of Tools for Conviviality. So here we are!</p>

<p>I found this book easier to digest than Deschooling. Perhaps I knew a bit better what I was getting myself into? By the way, <a href="https://arl.human.cornell.edu/linked%20docs/Illich_Tools_for_Conviviality.pdf">book PDF is available</a>.</p>

<h1>Two Watersheds: too much of a good thing</h1>

<p>Illich’s core critique of modernity is that modern tools, broadly defined, have great benefits, but they have been over applied. As a result, many areas touched by modernity pass through two watersheds:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first watershed, a modern approach improves a domain significantly.</li>
<li>In the second watershed, the same modern approach is over-applied, causing “negative returns”, “marginal disutility”, general dehumanization, loss of autonomy, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>These dangers of “over efficiency” remind me a lot of <a href="/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott/">Seeing Like a State</a>, which explores limits of naively applied high modernist thinking. Illich writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are two ranges in the growth of tools: the range within which machines are used to extend human capability and the range in which they are used to contract, eliminate or replace human function.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medicine: first watershed in 1913, when supposedly modern medicine caught up with witch doctors and began to outperform them. Second watershed in 1950s, when “90% of all medical care for patients with terminal diseases is unrelated to their health. Such treatment increases suffering and disability without demonstrably lengthening life.” </li>
<li>Transportation: In the early 1930s, Mexico connected most villages with dirt roads serviced by sturdy trucks moving at 20mph. Anyone could ride in these. As infra improved more and more money was sunk into a highway system, which enabled only those rich enough to access a car to use them.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Convivial limiting</h1>

<p>Illich’s main critique of modernity is that people are trained by social institutions to be tool operators. Instead, tools should be simpler to operate and adapt to the tool user. </p>

<p>Illich despises overdevelopment, especially insofar as it paves over the heterogeneity of human civilizations. The ancient Thai system of canals enabled farmers to travel with cheap light boats. Many of these canals were literally paved over with highways. A culturerally unique, perfectly functional system was dismantled in the name of homogeneity, all because of greed on the part of developers. </p>

<p>A convivial society would be one which imposes limits on consumption. Illich is opposed to most power tools since they are centralizing in nature. Cars require a network of paved roads and gas pipelines. Modern life requires a centralized electric grid.</p>

<p>This line of thinking leads to some pretty radical conclusions: “Commuter transportation leads to negative returns when it admits, anywhere in the system, speeds much above those reached on a bicycle. Once the barrier of bicycle velocity is broken at any point in the system, the total capital monthly time spent at the service of travel industry increases.” I’m calling bullshit on this one. Light rail and subways seem like a pretty good way of getting around.</p>

<p>I do like the vision of being basically contained in a very small pedestrian and cyclist friendly area for most of ones existence, interspersed with occasional long haul rail travel. An electric cargo bike is a perfect tool to do all shopping for the family, though this would necessarily exclude trips to Costco. Long-haul train rides are already quite pleasant. And Illich would be glad to know that Amtrak’s Seattle \&lt;=> Vancouver route currently averages about 20 mph. In terms of reducing air travel, I could see a lifestyle in which one spends 3 months in a remote staycation, half vacationing and half working from another country every couple of years.</p>

<h1>Convivial balancing</h1>

<p>To his credit, when it comes to rate of growth, Illich acknowledges that some change is good: “A changeless society would be as intolerable for people as the present society of constant change. Convivial reconstruction requires limits on the rate of compulsory change.” Geoff West has expressed similar sentiments in Scale.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is a balancing act, and I agree with Illich that as things stand, our collective societal balance is off. Here are Illich’s “five dimensions upon which the balance of life depends”:</p>

<ol>
<li>Faulty tech can render the environment uninhabitable</li>
<li>Radical monopoly can force the demand for affluence </li>
<li>Overprogramming can transform the world into a treatment ward when people are constantly taught, socialized, normalized, tested, and reformed.</li>
<li>Centralization and packaging of institutionally produced values can polarize society into structural despotism</li>
<li>Engineering obsolescence can break all bridges to a normative past</li>
</ol>

<h1>Radical monopoly</h1>

<p>I found this concept fascinating, and apparently it’s Illich’s own. A radical monopoly is when the dominance of one type of product supersedes dominance by any one brand. For example, cars do a lot to monopolize the way that people get around in many American cities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I speak about radical monopoly when one industrial production process exercises an exclusive control over the satisfaction of a pressing need.... That motor traffic curtains the right to walk, not that more people drive Chevies than Ford's, constitutes radical monopoly."</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>A convivial research agenda?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Leisurely scientific research does not exclude a bevatron or some ultracentrifuges; removal of access restrictions now created by schools would again admit the curious, rather than the orthodox, to the alchemist’s vault; and study for its own sake would produce more surprises than team research on how to eliminate production snags.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illich’s research agenda is Counterfoil Research: </p>

<ol>
<li>To provide guidelines for detecting incipient stages of murderous logic in a tool, </li>
<li>To devise tools and tool systems that optimize the balance of life, thereby maximizing liberty for all.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sounds like a really promising research ethos to me, meandering and passion driven, and more fundamentally basic. But unfortunately, this is something that is only available for independently wealthy gentlemen-scientists. Or perhaps beneficiaries of ARPA grants of yore. That said, some small, nascent research groups like Ink &amp; Switch, Dynamicland, and Otherlab appear to still operate similarly.</p>

<h1>Critiques</h1>

<p>Illich seems to be deeply influenced by projections from Ehrlich’s “The Population Bomb”, which never came to pass. He considers contraception as an especially convivial tool. Side note, Barry Commoner’s response to this Malthusian trap was described in The Closing Circle (1971) was a far less radical, level headed approach, suggesting that as poor people became richer, they would have fewer children, and the population would stabilize.</p>

<p>Illich calls for austerity, the need to self-limit, and slow progress in an attempt to fix society and make it more convivial. This is going to be a bitter pill for many to swallow, and Illich understands this well. I think you need a much more clearly positive vision for the future. I admire <a href="/books/rewiring-america">Rewiring America</a> for taking a stab at this.</p>

<hr />

<p>As usual, Illich does a good job of critiquing society, but path to specific solutions remains murky. Especially when it comes to the last sections on law and on politics, the writing becomes noticeably more vague, as if the author himself appears somewhat hazy on the right course of action.</p>

<p>Thus, how to move a whole society towards Illich’s post-industrial convivial vision is unclear. The main way in which I can see operationalizing it is by changing one’s personal life to live more convivially: live near work, walk and bike more, genuinely care more about others, do less busy work, home school your children, be present for major life events, build your own house, host more guests, etc.</p>

    <title>Frank Herbert by Tim O’Reilly</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/frank-herbert-by-tim-oreilly"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <h1>Meta: things about “Frank Herbert”, its author, the style in which it is written.</h1>

<ul>
<li>I’ll be honest, I’m excited about the upcoming Dune movie. Prior failed attempts do not inspire confidence.</li>
<li>How crazy is it that Tim O’Reilly wrote a book about Frank Herbert?</li>
<li>Book reads as a sort of expose about Herbert’s intentions writing Dune.</li>
<li>Good reminder about the series, which I first read probably more than 20 years ago. I’m due for a re-read.</li>
<li>Lots of plot summarization, but this is necessary for the non-Dune corpus of Herbert’s works which I haven’t read.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Frank Herbert the Person</h1>

<ul>
<li>Thoroughly PNW. Born in Tacoma, grew up on Olympic and Kitsap in NW Wash. </li>
<li>Lived in California, Oregon, returned to WA in 1969. "ecological demonstration project," an example of new-style "techno-peasantry”.</li>
<li>His mother had ten sisters, who were extremely close and shared in his upbringing.  (Interesting echo of Bene Gesserit) Orne's escape from the Nathian influence might be construed—and this is purely conjectural—as reminiscent of Herbert's own escape from the confines of the family matriarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Romance of the Desert</h1>

<ul>
<li>Dune was inspired by the dunes of Oregon. Herbert was in Florence, Oregon to write a feature story about a government project on the control of sand dunes.</li>
<li>In his research Herbert had noted how the desert seems to be a wellspring of religion. The history of Judaism demonstrates that harsh conditions make for a religion of anticipation.</li>
<li>Like the Jews, the Fremen have long been wandering and persecuted, always awaiting the promised land. And like the Arabs, the scattered Fremen discover their religious and cultural identity at the call of a strong leader, and build a mystical warrior-religion moved by economic as well as religious factors.</li>
</ul>

<h1>References I missed when I first read Dune</h1>

<ul>
<li>The name Atreides was also consciously chosen. It is the family name of Agamemnon. Says Herbert, "I wanted a sense of monumental aristocracy, but with tragedy hanging over them—and in our culture, Agamemnon personifies that."</li>
<li>Kierkegaard's "life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced" becomes a Bene Gesserit aphorism. Ecologist Paul B. Sears's statement, "the highest function of science is to give us an understanding of consequences" is expressed by Kynes as a fundamental ecological principle; and his "respect for truth comes close to being the basis for all morality" is recalled as a lesson Paul had received from his father.</li>
<li>Much of the Bene Gesserit technology of consciousness is based on the insights of general semantics, a philosophy and training method developed in the 1930s by Alfred Korzybski. Herbert had studied general semantics in San Francisco at about the time he was writing Dune.</li>
<li>Dune was written in 1963. It is predictive science fiction of the best kind. Oriental religion had not yet become widely popular in the West; only the most primitive biofeedback experiments were being conducted, and even those were being scoffed at by most scientists.</li>
<li>Karl Jaspers's primary formulation—that human life is bounded by inescapable limits such as death, uncertainty, struggle, and guilt—is also central to Herbert's thought.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Heightened awareness and brain-body interdependency</h1>

<ul>
<li>I remember this feeling on my first read: “Herbert's technology of consciousness is so nearly an extrapolation from the self- evident that it gives the reader at least the illusion (perhaps more) that he can learn techniques of heightened awareness for himself. And it gives many the itch to try…”</li>
<li>Still super fascinated by the brain-body loop. It was very interesting as part of my meditation forays. “Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness… focusing the consciousness… aortal dilation…”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Echoes of Taleb in Dune and Herbert’s thought</h1>

<ul>
<li>Skin in the game “The willing assumption of personal risk is one of the primary elements that distinguishes Paul from the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild…”</li>
<li>More SITG: “The Pakistani described the difference between American and Soviet engineers in charge of foreign-aid projects: The Soviet would stand back and supervise the operation from a distance, while the American would roll up his sleeves and show them how it was done”. Unlike the Atreides, the Emperor and the Harkonnens (recall the Baron's given name, Vladimir) would never involve themselves in personal risk.</li>
<li>Antifragility “Those who become utterly dependent on one means of mastery will find them- selves unable to cope with the future”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Dune demonstrates the perils of heros and hero worship.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Recalling the origins of Dune, Herbert says: It began with a concept: to do a long novel about the messianic convulsions which periodically inflict themselves on human societies. I had this idea that superheros were disastrous for humans.</li>
<li>The person who experiences greatness… must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.</li>
<li>Herbert deliberately looked for this reaction from his readers. To Herbert, the hero mystique is symptomatic of a deadly pathology in contemporary society, a compulsive yearning for easy answers. As long as men are looking for simple solutions to their problems, they will give over their ability to think for themselves to the first person who comes along and promises a solution. The Dune trilogy is an attempt to unveil that pattern and, in some small part, to change it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Avoid rigidity, aim to be more adaptable</h1>

<ul>
<li>“Strength lies in adaptability, not fixity. Civilization, on the other hand, tries to create and maintain security, which all too frequently crystallizes into an effort to minimize diversity and stop change.”</li>
<li>In our culture, individuals are trained to believe the evidence of mechanical measuring devices rather than their own senses. A feverish patient believes a thermometer, not his own discomfort.</li>
<li>"You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities," says Kynes.</li>
<li>Arrakis requires a willingness to flow with the environment rather than opposes and seek control of it.</li>
<li>Deep: ‘Orne realizes the Abbod is right: "To strengthen a thing, oppose it… You become like the worst in what you oppose.”’</li>
<li>Halmyrach Abbod's remark in "The Priests of Psi": "We have a very ancient saying: the more god, the more devil; the more flesh, the more worms; the more anxiety, the more control; the more control, the more that needs control."</li>
<li>'It's like a drug habit," said the Abbod. "If you enforce peace, it will take greater and greater amounts of peace to satisfy you. And you will use more and more violence to obtain it. The cycle will end in cataclysm."</li>
</ul>

<h1>Against Psychohistory, Dune vs. Foundation</h1>

<ul>
<li>Bene Gesserit is found in a study of their literary antecedents. The Bene Gesserit are based in part on the scientific wizards of Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy.</li>
<li>In contrast to the Foundation trilogy's exaltation of rationality's march to predicted victory, Dune proclaims the power and primacy of the unconscious and the unexpected in human affairs.</li>
<li>This is essentially the assumption that science can produce a surprise-free future for humankind.</li>
<li>I should be wary of this in my own attraction to super-forecasters. “messianic hunger is an example of a pervasive human need for security and stability in a universe that continually calls on people to improvise and adapt to new situations.” </li>
</ul>

<h1>Examples of Foxiness</h1>

<ul>
<li>As Herbert has emphasized, he is not a "hot-gospel ecologist," convinced that all man's interventions into nature are evil. Ecology, like all other creeds, is dangerous when it becomes an absolute.</li>
<li>...there are no right answers and no complete doctrine. There are only answers and their consequences. What happens to people who follow any given set of beliefs? The subtleties of one doctrine as opposed to another are resolved not by logic but by looking at their effects.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How have films influenced books?</h1>

<ul>
<li>"I treat the reader's eye as a camera," Herbert says. There may be a generalized view of a scene, which is followed more and more by a concentration on the area in which the action is going to happen. Finally the eye is brought in for close-ups, "a hand tapping on the table, or somebody's mouth chewing the food."</li>
</ul>

<h1>Herbert is in favour of scenario planning, not prediction, just like Gordon</h1>

<ul>
<li>“I think it's a mistake to think about THE future, one future. We ought to think more of planning for futures as an art form, for quality of life. We have as many futures as we can invent.”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Interesting further reading after reading this book</h1>

<ul>
<li>Under Pressure: What the crew-except for one member does not know is that there are no habitable planets at Tau Ceti, and the real purpose of the mission is to create an artificial consciousness in the ship's computer...</li>
<li>The Eyes of Heisenberg: Most of the book takes place in the "Seatac Megalopolis" </li>
<li>The Santaroga Barrier: describes an ambiguous utopia. It makes real demands on the reader (Herbert hopes) in depicting a society that "half my readers would think was utopia, the other half would think was dystopia."</li>
<li>Science Fiction and a World in Crisis essay.</li>
<li>Alvin Toffler's Future Shock</li>
</ul>

    <title>Story of Us by Tim Urban</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Tim Urban describes the evo-devo view of humanity in an entertaining light in this long, illustrated series. It’s cumbersome to read as separate articles, and would be more natural in book or pamphlet form (surely this is coming).</p>

<p>This is a pretty great, digestible format, tying together many ideas into a single coherent almost masterwork. The mental models along the way are really cool, and well illustrated. Unfortunately it hasn’t really gelled together yet. Maybe in the sequel?</p>

<h1>Chapter 1: Fire vs Light</h1>

<ul>
<li>Genetic forces conspire to make life miserable. “The problem is that genes themselves aren’t alive, they’re just a force of nature—and forces of nature don’t give a shit about anything. Gravity wants to smoosh matter together, so that’s what it does.” (Dawkins, Selfish Gene)</li>
<li>Your genes are in control of your Primitive Mind (System 1), while your Higher Mind (System 2) has more agency. By default the Primitive Mind is in control, but people are especially good at not letting this happen. (Kahnemann &amp; Tversky, Thinking Fast and Slow)</li>
<li><strong>Model: Thought Spectrum</strong>. Rather than viewing as a dual, you can see Primitive vs Higher mind as a spectrum. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/1-thought-spectrum.png" alt="Thought spectrum" /></p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Games of Giants</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Emergence Tower</strong>. Life came about on one of the rungs of the Emergence Tower, a nice concept mentioned in any intro to biology class. Many atoms form a molecule, many of which form proteins, many of which form organelles, etc. The most interesting points along this tower are cells, individuals, and groups.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/2-emergence-tower.png" alt="Emergence tower" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Some species like bears are most interesting as individuals. Ants are most interesting when considered at a colony (1000s of individuals) level. Humans are interesting on many levels, from individual to billions of individuals.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, evolution has made people in tribes act “micro-kind and macro-ruthless.” For example, “people who are normally compassionate drop that compassion when thinking and talking about members of a political party they hate”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chapter 3: Stories</h1>

<ul>
<li>Tribes of people have the ability to create stories, and pass these stories from one person to another. These stories carry ideas about values and morals.</li>
<li>People are also capable of social learning, imagination, and the negative side affect: delusion. </li>
<li>The result of these things is that different tribes end up with “endless arrays of behavioural varieties—a million little evolutionary experiments”.</li>
<li><strong>Model: Each tribe is then controlled by its story</strong>, and the tribe with the most evolutionarily adaptive story will ultimately win out over the rest. Ultimately, tribe vs. tribe in zero sum “Power Games”.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/3-tribe-stories.png" alt="Tribes and stories" /></p>

<h1>Chapter 4: Enlightenment</h1>

<ul>
<li>After being ruled by Tzars, Kings, Dictators, since ancient times, Enlightenment thinkers began to take stock of history and consider alternatives. </li>
<li>“In the Power Games, kings, emperors, and warlords were typically focused on some set of goals—personal or national prosperity, defence, etc”. Conversely, “The Constitution described a sacred process—a set of inviolable means by which any and all national or individual goals would need to be accomplished.”</li>
<li>Rule of Law came about as a result. “The Power Games is full of people being found guilty without evidence and punished unfairly, something the Enlightenment was determined to put an end to—so the hard rule would be: innocent until proven guilty.”</li>
<li><strong>Model: Power Games vs. Value Games</strong>. “While it was typically better to be feared than loved in the Power Games, in the Value Games, it’s usually better to be loved than feared—which keeps politicians and businesses on their best behavior.”
<img src="/books/story-of-us/4-power-vs-value.png" alt="Power vs Value Games" /></li>
</ul>

<h1>Chapter 5: Mute Button</h1>

<ul>
<li>To understand humans at a larger scale, it’s worth modelling some of the dynamics at play when groups of humans meet. The basic model is this: people have an inner and an outer self. People’s outer selves communicate using language. A human in a society is like a neuron in a brain.</li>
<li>One’s inner and outer self need not be fully aligned. You can believe things that you dare not speak. For any given topic there is a range of what is acceptable to speak and/or believe.</li>
<li><strong>Model: expression spectrum</strong> of speech platforms, from national speech (official from on high) to community discussions, to small groups of friends.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/6-expression-spectrum.png" alt="Expression Spectrum" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: idea spectrum &amp; Thought Pile</strong> models various positions on a specific topic. By putting idea spectrum on X and expression spectrum on Y, plot a Thought Pile of what people believe.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/5-idea-spectrum.png" alt="Thought Pile" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Speech Curve</strong>: Also draw a Speech Curve of what is acceptable to say at which expression level. For example, you can hold fringe views in a small group that has a certain set of priors and shared understanding. But if the same thing was said at a larger scale, it would not land well.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/7-speech-curve.png" alt="Speech Curve" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes if a despot is in charge, he will want to control what people think, as a way to hold on to power. There is no direct way to control though, but there is a direct way to punish and control speech. </li>
<li>“Censorship takes a single region formed by an aligned Thought Pile and Speech Curve and turns it into three regions by generating two “censorship gaps.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/8-censorship.png" alt="Censorship's effect on Thoguht Pile and Speech Curve" /></p>

<h1>Chapter 6: American Brain</h1>

<ul>
<li>Thought Piles need not be normally distributed. In America they are often bimodal.</li>
<li>You don’t need to be ruled by a despot for there to be discrepancy between Thought Pile and Speech Curve. </li>
<li><strong>Model: Overton window</strong> There’s a range of ideas the public will accept as politically reasonable (Overton window) and politicians at the highest level are often hamstrung by it. They can’t really move it themselves, just need to feel its boundaries.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/9-overton-window.png" alt="Overton window" /></p>

<ul>
<li>“If you live in a democracy, and you’re not zoomed out far enough, you might look at the politicians running your government and mistake them for your leaders. In the short term, sure, they jostle with each other over the country’s policies and steer the country on the international stage. But with a step back, the real long-term leader of a democracy is the giant communal brain of the citizen body.”</li>
<li><strong>Model: Thought Pile follows Speech Curve</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/10-changing-minds.png" alt="Changing Minds" /></p>

<h1>Chapter 7: Thinking Ladder</h1>

<ul>
<li>There’s a tension between just caring about what is true, and wanting to have your deepest beliefs confirmed. “So when it comes to beliefs, the Primitive Mind doesn’t want truth, it wants confirmation—of your existing beliefs.”</li>
<li><strong>Model: psych spectrum</strong>, although I think many people often apply different types of thinking personas to different problems:
<ul>
<li>Scientist: “chasing truth is like climbing through thick fog up an infinitely high mountain. It’s the pursuit of something that can never be fully achieved, but it can be approached—and their goal is simply to continue moving up the mountain”</li>
<li>Sports fan: “It’s just…that they really really want that process to yield a certain outcome. They’re not just watching the game—they’re rooting.”</li>
<li>Attorney: "The client is not guilty. Now let’s figure out why.”</li>
<li>Zealot: “In reality, you’ve taken a set of ideas to be sacred, and you’ve given up an independent truth-seeking path in order to faithfully serve those sacred ideas”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/11-psych-spectrum.png" alt="Psych Spectrum" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Skepticism Spectrum</strong>. “Move to the left of the sweet spot on the spectrum, where the filter is looser, and you begin to allow some bullshit to flow into your beliefs. Move even farther left and your beliefs become packed with a jumble of falsehoods, misconceptions, and contradictions. Moving to the right of the sweet spot tightens the filter too much, like a business owner so worried about accidentally accepting Monopoly money that they end up turning down real money too. Go way to the right and you’ll stop believing the moon landing happened.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/12-skepticism-spectrum.png" alt="Skepticism Spectrum" /></p>

<h1>Chapter 8: Idea Labs vs. Echo Chambers</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Idea Labs</strong> are collections of Higher Minds, independent thinkers all seeking truth, working off one another and testing one another’s ideas. “Thoughtful contrarianism is valued because there’s an implicit understanding that the evolution of knowledge works like the evolution of life.” “Humility wins you major respect in an Idea Lab—where “I don’t know” is a very cool thing to say.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/13-idea-lab-vs-echo-chamber.png" alt="Idea Labs" /></p>

<ul>
<li>There aren’t that many of these places around though. Because even though the constitution is awesome, people are often not. “Free speech, like any Value Games privilege, requires both the government and the culture to be on board. The U.S. Constitution makes free speech possible—but only within the right culture does the freedom come to fruition.”</li>
<li><strong>Model: the opposite of an Idea Lab is an Echo Chamber</strong>. “To put a visual to it, Idea Lab culture views agreement and decency as separate, unrelated axes, while Echo Chamber culture views agreement and decency as a single axis”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/14-idea-lab-vs-echo-chamber-thought-spectrum.png" alt="Idea Labs 2" /></p>

<ul>
<li>“The over-application of taboo is the bane of free speech, so pro-free-speech cultures use it sparingly. This frees the Idea Lab’s Speech Curve to freely line up with its Thought Pile.” In an Echo Chamber, Thought Pile and Speech Curve do not align, you end up with effective censorship. </li>
<li>“An Echo Chamber’s taboo minefield makes it a safe and protected space for all ideas that confirm the sacred beliefs and a very dangerous space for ideas—and people—that don’t.”</li>
<li>Conversely, Idea Labs are not a safe place for people whose identities are tied to their specific ideas. And this is many people.</li>
<li>This is a useful model, but I think in practice people’s identities are always comprised of both Echo Chambers and Idea Labs, and this is a good thing. “A human society is a rich tapestry of overlapping and sometimes sharply contradictory cultures, and each of us lives at our own unique cultural intersection.”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chapter 9: Political Disney World</h1>

<ul>
<li>Politics is reminiscent of many of the worst aspects of religion. In terms of the psych spectrum, “The Political Ladder is bottom-heavy”, meaning full of zealots.
<ul>
<li><strong>Model: 2D political spectrum.</strong> By considering the political right-left spectrum with a Y-axis of psych spectrum, it becomes less about right vs. left, more about top vs. bottom, ways of thinking.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/15-2D-political-spectrum.jpg" alt="2D Political Spectrum" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: conservatives vs progressives on emergence tower</strong> nice little tie in.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/16-conservative-progressive-emergence-tower.png" alt="Conservative vs Progressive" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Disney characters.</strong> Disney characters tend to be binary: good incarnate, or evil incarnate. All nuance is lost. The same is done by Americans when thinking about politics.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/17-binary-disney-characters.png" alt="Binary Disney" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Causation is Hard</strong>. Given any two events, it’s often very hard to establish causation. The causation arrow can be strategically placed to make whatever point you’d like. (Book of Why)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/18-causation-possibilities.png" alt="Causation is Hard" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Sucky Man</strong> are all great ways of arguing in order to convince others:
<ul>
<li>Straw Man: reframe the wording of a strong dissenting argument, transform it into a much weaker argument.</li>
<li>Weak Man: takes a strong argument, hand-pick the weakest part of it and attacks that.</li>
<li>Hollow Man: fabricate a fake argument from scratch. Often framed by “some people say” – the easiest match possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model: Motte and Bailey:</strong> good visual explanation of the less-wrong concept.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/19-motte-baile-examples.png" alt="Motte Bailey" /></p>

<h1>Chapter 10: A Sick Giant</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model: Media matrix</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/books/story-of-us/20-media-matrix.png" alt="Media Matrix" /></p>

<p>Very unsatisfying end (?) to the series. Many great models were introduced in prior chapters, but this last post is mostly a regurgitation of interesting Pew Research polls. Occasional references to Higher and Primitive Minds, but that’s about it!</p>

    <title>Rewiring America</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/rewiring-america"/>
    
    <updated>2020-09-20T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/rewiring-america</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This is less of a book and more of a propaganda pamphlet, which can be succinctly summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The technical path to decarbonization is simply this: we must electrify (nearly) everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I picked this book up because I admire the author for being a prolific inventor and entrepreneur and seemingly chill dude. I once toured Otherlab thanks to my friend AK, which was awesome and inspiring. I rate it as worthwhile because it’s a bold opinionated bet, which is refreshing when the dominant climate narrative is “Honestly, we need to do everythinggggg”.</p>

<p><strong>Like WWII mobilization</strong>. Saul’s position is that the only way to un-fuck ourselves and remain on a 2C warming trajectory is to do an “aggressive WWII-style production ramp-up of three to five years”. He adds some colour to the WWII era mobilization effort, painting a very shabby military picture as late as 1939, when “the US had only 1700 aircraft and no bombers. By 1945, the US had 300,000 military aircraft, 18,500 B-24 bombers.”</p>

<p><strong>Positive enough vision?</strong> I strongly agree that we need a positive vision for 2020 and climate, but I didn’t find the one that he provides “If we build the right infrastructure, right away, the future will be awesome!” to be much of a rallying cry. Awesome how? Also I don’t believe in the vitality of a cry to defer gratification. Seems counter to the dominant culture.</p>

<p><strong>California/Australia centric</strong> “Everyone should install solar on their roofs at the next opportunity, whether that be a retrofit, replacing shingles, or buying or building a new house.” makes little sense in many places that are less sunny year-round. For example according to project Sunroof, doing this on my house would cost me $2000 over 20 years, with a $20,000 cost up-front. Similarly, I just bought a hybrid vehicle, but buying an all-electric one would cost either 50% more, and waiting 2 extra years (RAV4 Prime) or 100% more if it’s the Tesla Model Y,. And I don’t have a good place to plug a PHEV in. Plus full-electric precludes a bunch of stuff like going on hikes and driving on shitty roads. Suspect people in apartments have even less opportunity for a plug-in. And I’m super rich and on board with this whole climate thing.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation in consumer loans</strong> Revolutionary mortgages and low-interest loans were in the 20th century. I’ve have heard him speak about this before in a Long Now seminar, and this remains compelling because of the possibility of changing behaviour at scale. “America’s lifestyle has been built on loans. Creating a climate loan in response to the climate crisis has clear historical precedent.” While true and interesting, car loans enabled people to own a car, and mortgages enabled them to own a house. A climate loan has no selfish benefits. This revolution has to be a government-sponsored thing, just like WWII didn’t require individuals to like take a loan in order to buy a tank for the war effort.</p>

<p><strong>Rosy battery cost projections</strong> for batteries are a bit optimistic… Saul projects $75/kWh by 2024, a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Lithium-ion-battery-price-history-and-forecast-Source-Bloomberg-2018b_fig3_340952556">random graph</a> I just found suggests more like $96/kWh by 2025. The challenge of multiple uses and battery degradation remains. Especially if one buys a large battery for their house, or expects to be driving an EV for 250,000 miles like we did the Toyota Highlander.</p>

<p><strong>Why Makani shut down</strong>. It which was aiming to produce wind energy at 3-4 c/kWh, 5-6 times cheaper than other wind-powered electricity at the time. Now wind power is 4-5c/kWh. “In 2020, Makani shut down due to this evaporated advantage.”</p>

<p><strong>General gripes about regulation</strong>. Great example with SF roof solar panels not being allowed to extend to the edge of the roof. Instead they must be set back 4’, which in practice eliminates 44% of the area.</p>

<p><strong>Central planning would be nice</strong>. A section about electrifying 250 million vehicles, 130M households, 6M trucks, etc reminds me of how much easier such a monumental task would be in a country like China, if they set their mind to it. And it’s easy in this case because you actually know how much of everything you need, because you just replace all of the existing things with electric versions.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon sequestration doesn’t work</strong>. Makes sense to me not to focus on sequestration at either smoke stacks or from atmosphere because science. Makes physics sense and also corroborated by Mark Lynas in <a href="https://overcast.fm/+JRaWQWkWs">this episode of 80,000 hours</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon taxes ineffective, politically fraught</strong> (I think that the main suggestion of this book is more politically fraught than passing a carbon tax.) Saul argues that it’d take too long to see the effects of a carbon tax, and that electricity is becoming so cheap as is, that it won’t really matter. Maybe. I don’t think this is happening fast enough. I think many Americans buying cars in the next 5 years will opt for gasoline or hybrid solutions rather than electric ones. But a carbon tax might shift the numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Yes and…</strong> Nice little FAQ at the end, but spread pretty thin. Blanket assertion that “The rare earth metals used in high energy magnets and electronics are actually not as rare as their name implies.” No source. Also kind of sloppy rejection of self driving cars as a potentially good thing, ignoring possible benefits of automated fleets and more densely packed passengers. Electric aircraft? This is still science fiction, hasn’t been done.</p>

<p>Overall I found the message to a bit monistic, but also pragmatic. I liked the outright rejection of approaches like CCS that won’t actually work. And hard boiled assessments of individual actions that are admirable but ultimately won’t be enough, like eating less meat.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>First time listening to a book in Russian.</p>

<p>For some reason, found an <a href="https://akniga.org/dostoevskiy-fedor-bratya-karamazovy-stranicy-romana">abridged and dramatized</a> version, but by the time I realized this was the case, I was already well into it. No matter - the reader and dramatization was incredible, although I felt that the production suffered a bit from overly floral musical interludes. </p>

<p>This is a masterpiece of writing, vivid characters, and a terrifying portrayal of some of humanity's worst. Greed, so expertly portrayed by Dmitry Fedorovich and his father Fedor Pavlovich. Exquisitely neglectful parenting! The greed theme is so sickening of its own accord, but is compounded by one of the most disturbing father-son relationships. </p>

<p>The plot is complex, featuring a love pentagon, I think. Let me count the edges. Two brothers, their father, and two women. At least. </p>

<p>Золотые прииски. Сцена с Хохлаковой+++ Ну вообще, так образно описана Русская женщина!</p>

<p>Some of the most painful, vivid and florid expressions of love. So very Russian. Грушенька reminds me of A, and Митя reminds me of B, circa 15 years ago. Of course, they are far less extreme versions, but unrequited, violent, irrational, completely blind love is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>The mystery aspect of this book is intense, with the missed scene. Is there a patricide? Yes, but in a roundabout way. </p>

<p>Clearly things are missing in this abridged edition. Reading more into the story, I was disappointed to find whole characters missing, and reading more into it, I think that Ivan comes off somewhat flat, and could have been portrayed in more idealistic detail. </p>

    <title>Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>One of the better written Neal Stephenson books I’ve read so far. I found the first half especially engaging. Extremely varied, this book covers a lot of ground. </p>

<ul>
<li>History: Cromwell and the English Civil War, the Third Anglo-Dutch war. </li>
<li>Famous scientists and the Royal Society: Newton, Boyle, Hooke, Leibniz, <em>Waterhouse</em>. </li>
<li>Sailing and pirates: Edward Teach (Blackbeard) and <em>Otto van Hoek, captain of The Minerva</em></li>
<li>Pandemics and end-times: 1666 as the year of the beast, as well as continuing waves of the Black Death in London.</li>
<li>Money: bullion to paper &amp; centralized banking, and back.</li>
<li>Jews: a lens crafter makes a cameo in a casually anti-semitic context. Spinoza is mentioned. Wilkins’ treatise on tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this to be an excellent example of fiction doing what non-fiction can only dream of: in this case, imbuing dry history with a soul. Stephenson masterfully guides his reader through the gradual evolution of bullion and coinage to bills, and the regression that follows the Dutch war. A far more entertaining vignette of something dryly described in Debt.</p>

<p>Waterhouse aboard the Minerva feels like a more fun version of Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe I was especially into it since I’m sailing so much this year. Nice to see Stevenson using some antiquated sailing terms too. I learned that <em>larboard</em> is an antiquated term for port.</p>

<p>Part of the fun of reading Quicksilver is that, unless you cheat or happen to know many personalities from the 17th century, it’s hard to know whether a character is real or fictional. Daniel Waterhouse was so vivid by the end of it, I wasn’t sure about his status until checking.</p>

<p>The book feels a bit unfinished. For example, what happened to Enoch Root? Some passages are a bit rough, like the repetitive dialog with the Jew, who is continually called “The Ashkenazi”, “The Forelocked One”, “The Circumsized One”, etc. The last half felt a bit rushed, and the battle which Waterhouse solves with Trigonometry was a bit of a stretch!</p>

        <p>Since May, I’ve been tinkering with brushless electrical motors, trying to make floating objects move more quickly. The proximate result is this electric motorized paddleboard:</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9BbHWMzhPdxekJZf7"><img src="/esup-builders/esup.gif" alt="Riding my DIY eSUP" /></a></p>

<p>This project is by no means finished. Traveling at 5 mph is fun, but not nearly fast enough. As we speak, a motor ten times the power of this one is sitting in a shipping container, en route to my basement. While I wait, let me pause and reflect on the project so far.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This summer I’ve been spending more time on the water. Sailing and stand-up paddling are great escapes from a sometimes monotonous routine. As a result, I’m slowly forgetting luxuries I once took for granted: work trips, visits to Vancouver, vacations to faraway lands.</p>

<p>After my forced sailing hiatus, I needed to find another way to get out on the water. SUPing was great fun, but a bit repetitive, and frustrating in even light headwind. Driven by the need for speed, I found <a href="http://efoil.builders/">efoil.builders</a>. They are a community of crazy European kids building electric hydrofoils that scream above the surface of the water at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to strange electric vehicles, but I certainly was when it came to high voltage and high current. When my Solowheel broke down last year and I was unable to fix it on my own, I donated it to an acquaintance who promptly replaced the battery and brought it into tip-top shape. It took him no time at all, but I had no idea where to begin.</p>

<p>Happily, the last few months have presented many opportunities for electrical work around the house. I installed a ceiling fan in our bedroom and a window AC in my daughter’s. I wired up and installed new outlets in the basement. These are not glamorous achievements, just small victories that slightly reduced my fear of electricity.</p>

<h1>Building for …</h1>

<p>There is something very satisfying about creating physical objects with your own hands. In these strange times, I find this to be one of my most comforting escapes.</p>

<p>If the resulting object is of value to you or others, so much the better. <a href="/toddler-music-box">Building for my daughter</a> takes the cake, especially when she appreciates the results. <a href="/little-free-library">Building for the community</a> is also gratifying and surprising. Sometimes you just build to learn. This time, I’m building for myself. And in this case, a big part of the challenge will be learning to ride the damn thing. I think I’m up for the challenge!</p>

<p>Realizing that I’m dealing with a completely new domain, and my chance of failure is high, I decided to start small. The first milestone was to create some sort of vessel from a plastic IKEA bin (max 30A, 11V, 5000 RPM, 3cm prop). Having proved the concept, I moved on to something that would support my weight, and substantially larger components (60A, 22V, 1000 RPM, 15cm prop).</p>

<p>Let me conclude with a parts list for both builds.</p>

<h1>Tropfast components</h1>

<p>As you can see, this is not a seaworthy vessel.</p>

<h1>Shared components</h1>

<p>As you can see, both vessels have a lot of component types in common. So much so that I simply reused some of the same parts in both projects:</p>

</ul>

<p>I plan to write up a technical summary of what I learned in the process. Stay tuned.</p>

        <p>Somehow I am just now reading Cormac McCarthy for the first time. Thanks for the recommendation, M!</p>

<p>Incredible descriptions. Long beautifully flowing sentences and great vocabulary. I find myself looking up new words every few pages, and it feels nice to be reading literature again. The style is interesting too, with uniquely applied passive dialogs that I found very distinct.</p>

<p>Perhaps reading this serious dystopia at a particularly dystopian feeling time wasn’t the best call. Although short, it took me a while to finish, spacing my consumption apart, to avoid overdosing on doom and gloom.</p>

<p>The apocalyptic scenario was well done and mysterious. What happened to humanity to cause such a scenario? Half way, it’s unclear if that will actually be revealed or not. By the end of the book, somehow it doesn’t matter. The world sucks you in. It is what it is, and humanity persists.</p>

<p>Parts of this book reminded me of an interactive fiction, or a role playing game, especially the constant search for loot, rummaging through abandoned barns, copious amounts of useless, broken rakes.</p>

<p>And yet so dark, so biblical.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do you think that your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledger books? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the core of this book is the father son dynamic between the anonymous man and anonymous boy. It is deeply touching. Oh man, how incredibly sad that last scene is, even though you can see it coming for miles. I spent a good amount of time shedding tears, so surely this is a great work.</p>

    <title>Red Plenty by Francis Spufford</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Red Plenty is written as a series of vignettes that together do a remarkably good job of painting a picture of soviet life. It finds a comfortable spot between fiction and non-fiction. If someone ever asks me for a book on what life was like in the Soviet Union, I’d recommend this.</p>

<p>For me personally, it tied together a lot of personalities and events I was previously familiar with, having been raised in a Russian family. But many aspects crystallized in a more objective, less personal way. It was nice to feel certain stories and personalities fall into place, and fascinating to hear about some of the same events and people in English.</p>

<p>Spufford takes liberties for sure, often putting real people into semi-imagined situations. But this is done explicitly and honestly. He doesn’t quite tie everything together into a coherent arc. Instead, multiple sub-stories can be seen: Galich’s transformation from bon-vivant and darling of the state to a dissident, Khrushev’s rise from obscurity, and disillusioned retirement, a biologist’s battle with Lysenkoism, a mathematical economist’s attempt to reform central planning.</p>

<p>The author’s conception of the whole project of communism is that it itself is a sort of fable, heavily inspired by  Russian fables. Stories about the self-setting tablecloth (скатерть самобранка), flying carpets (ковер самоет), beyond the 39th land (тридевять земелья). He could have included any number of such fables, and to be fair, this is true of any techno-utopian perspective.</p>

<p>The format lends itself well to showing Russia from many lenses, letting the reader triangulate into the bigger picture. What is the role of connections in a world where money isn’t generally effective? Spufford shows how, to climb the ranks of an organization, one had to grovel and pander to communist ideologues despite deepest feelings. He shows cynicism, corruption, and violence that permeated life. He shows how stuck many people felt within it, especially women.</p>

<p>Despite my familiarity with the general outlines of many pieces of this book, I learned some completely new stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novocherkassk_massacre">Расстрел в новочеркасске</a> — First I’ve heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok">Akademgorodok</a> - I have an acquaintance from there, and have heard of it before, but this is way more detail than I’d ever known.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been listening to Галич lately…</p>

<li>Twisting narrative, very hard to predict any sort of narrative arc. In a good way.</li>
<li>Some great descriptive and lively, well developed characters.</li>
<li>Well executed twists.</li>
<li>Some really inventive fragments of world building, like the flower mechanic but I would say overall mostly unoriginal in that department.</li>
<li>In the end, I’m 50% hooked, but not hooked enough to jump right into the sequel. Maybe it’s because the grand arc of the whole thing is kind of known, and explicitly so.</li>

        <p>When my sailing class was canceled back in early March, I realized it was time for a more individualistic hobby. And so, I furled the sails and tied up the boat and picked up a circular saw from the hardware store. After I got over my fears of loud, terrifyingly quickly spinning metal blades, a whole bunch of cutting and screwing, then digging and painting, I have a Little Free Library standing outside my house, and a little bit more confidence for the next woodworking project!</p>

<p><img src="/little-free-library/little-free-library.jpg" alt="Little free library photo" /></p>

<!--more-->

<p>I drafted some <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d57c2f5444558be437e513c4/w/9e862248a8541fe7ce7a38a6/e/3efc51d554390f104d869fa6">initial plans in OnShape</a>, and deviated from them only slightly, the main difference being a much smaller front-right panel to make book access easier. As I became familiar with woodworking tools, I became a little bit less rigid and precise with measurements. </p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
<li>A very long plank of scrap wood found in my basement, 20mm deep was enough for structural materials.</li>
<li>30 or so brass screws</li>
<li>6 long screws</li>
<li>A fence post</li>
<li>Self-closing hinges and a button</li>
<li>Exterior-grade paint</li>
<li>A sheet of thin scrap plywood for shingles</li>
<li>Plexiglass sheet</li>
<li>Circular saw</li>
<li>Electric drill</li>
<li>Silicone mat</li>
<li>Caulk</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
<li>Shovel</li>
<li>Wood hand saw</li>
<li>Probably lots more</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mistakes and learnings:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don’t use brass screws, they are fragile. I broke two of them as I was screwing them. Instead, use steel. It’s cheaper and far stronger.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on glue for shingles. They warp, so use nails to hammer them on. I had to do this after it rained and they warped, despite a copious amount of glue.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on the guide of the circular saw. Instead, look at what the blade is actually doing at the cut point. I had a few rough cuts early on.</li>
<li>Use a protractor in order to measure 45 degree angles more accurately, which I found tricky to do through thick 4x4 fence posts (circular saw radius was too small, had to use a hand saw)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K3xP2XjPmUQ2bX1N7">more photos</a> that document the process. The results are passable but honestly, a little bit sloppy. Build quality aside, I’m thrilled to see actual use: the roster of books changing quickly. My initial dump of philosophy books was partially picked off, and then swiftly amended. I had predicted very little movement during the pandemic because of decreased foot traffic and increased paranoia about touching public things, but was sorely mistaken.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matthew for the pro-tips and help!</p>

    <title>Selected Short Stories of Philip K. Dick</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/selected-short-stories-of-philip-k-dick"/>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/selected-short-stories-of-philip-k-dick</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Almost every story in this collection elicits a “wow” and “yikes” gut reaction from me. Well written and original, many of these have been adapted into movies. </p>

<p>These stories do show some signs of aging: Cold War politics, Mechanical computers, Robots. But this makes them more authentic and gives them a distinct feeling. And while many things have changed, many others have not: Russia is still (again?) America’s adversary, Robots are still cool, and all of the tech nerds are obsessed with Mars. More fundamentally, Dick’s stories grapple with paranoia and mental instability, god, Dogs, the nature of reality, the evils of authoritarianism, and the banality of American consumerism.</p>

<p>These stories are dark, irreverent, funny, and sometimes profound. Highly recommended!</p>

<h2>Beyond Lies the Wub ★</h2>

<p>A large pacifist pig is mysteriously telepathic. It just wants to have philosophical discussions with you. But Captain Franco is hungry. He kills the Wub and eats it. His crew is disgusted by such despicable behaviour. But by the end of their dinner, Franco appears to be in a strangely philosophical frame of mind...</p>

<p>Is Franco a Wub now? Did the Wub become a pig from someone else? Is the Wub external to both?</p>

<h2>Roog</h2>

<p>A dog’s perspective. Boris the Guardian (dog) sees Roogs (garbage men) and guards his humans. Primitive but cute. </p>

<h2>Paycheck</h2>

<p>A mechanic is hired by a company doing advanced research. They pay well under the condition that they wipe his memories while he worked there. (Did this happen multiple times already?) Eventually, wanting to break the loop, the mechanic figures out a way to exact revenge.</p>

<p>PKD is obsessed with my name. The protagonist in this story has a Boris gun. (That said, this and the previous story are the only Borises featured in this collection).</p>

<h2>Second variety ★</h2>

<p>Following a nuclear winter started by the Russians, the Americans avoid complete defeat by retreating to the moon. As a resistance movement, The Americans develop robots built in autonomous underground factories. These robots self-improve and eventually become indistinguishable from humans, and exploit human emotion ruthlessly: type 1 is a small child clutching a teddy bear, Type 3 is a wounded soldier. </p>

<p>The story and world building is epic and extremely creepy. The story arc culminates when an American Major is left alone with 3 supposed Russians, one of which is a cylon of type 2. The crux is that it's not clear how many types there are in total, and this all plays out very dramatically, although I had some inkling of where things were going. Apparently the basis for “Screamers”.</p>

<h2>Imposter</h2>

<p>Another thriller of AIs and robots so convincing that even the robot itself can be a hundred percent convinced that it is in fact the person that it is emulating. Not a new idea even at Dick’s time but well executed.</p>

<h2>King of the Elves ★</h2>

<p>Cinematic and original take on insanity. The parallel worlds of gas station attendant and elf troll conflict is really compelling. It remains unclear which one is reality. I guess this is Dicks superpower: parallel un-realities. What is reality anyway?</p>

<h2>Adjustment Team ★</h2>

<p>Very stressful read. All of PKD seems to be like this: the protagonist discovers a crazy thing about reality, and is finds himself in an impossible situation where he is questioning his own sanity while trying to prove to someone that he is actually right. </p>

<p>An active God with a crazy plan to end the Cold War! I so love it when religion and science fiction meet. And comedy. I love the impeccable timing of annoying door to door vacuum and life insurance salesmen. </p>

<p>And another God-like dog. PKD is obsessed with dogs. I wonder if it's because dog is god backwards. I bet he had that thought more than once.</p>

<h2>Foster You’re Dead</h2>

<p>Ok. A little much for these COVID-19 times... All about a new American consumerism, stemming from over zealous cold warriors obsessed with survivalism. Mike's father is “anti-P”, a non survivalist without a backyard nuclear shelter. Eventually he caves in to the social pressure, but realizes he can't afford it. </p>

<p>Pretty good overall and timely in terms of survivalism being trendy. but slightly dated, in that consumer culture feels less pervasive. That said, I could see this coming back with something like <a href="https://medium.com/@RickByers/the-dawn-of-personal-biotech-cb0af0d52e4c">in-home PCR machines</a>.</p>

<h2>Upon the Dull Earth</h2>

<p>A uniquely creepy story featuring a young wife who finds an alien swarm of drones that call her siren song. Though her husband and family try to dissuade her, she succumbs to the force too soon by accident. In an attempt to bring her back, her husband makes a pact with the alien swarm, which turns her younger sister into her, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Masterfully crafted, this reads more like horror than science fiction. To the husband’s terror, each person he meets morbidly transforms into his beloved, first all of the members of her family, then their whole town and county, extending out to the whole world. The fear and terror of the despondent husband. Again, is this really happening, or is this an exploration into madness?</p>

<h2>Autofac</h2>

<p>In a post h-bomb destroyed world, humans subsist on essential goods that are forcibly delivered to their door. This automatic factory system was set in place as a contingency for when a nuclear war wipes out the world. But it's been a while and people are getting bored. The Autofac is programmed to keep delivering until people can self sustain, but there's one problem: the Autofac production pipeline is stripping earth bare.</p>

<p>Ultimately a super intelligence narrative, this story packs a punch, and is interesting in that it explores human-like competition in a super intelligent species.</p>

<h2>The Days of Perky Pat ★</h2>

<p>In a strange reversal, the surviving families of a nuclear war (called “flukies” because they survived due to luck) rely on their young children to get by. Meanwhile the parents spend all their time playing house with dolls. Perky Pat is a doll which is played by playing house in an elaborate game modelling the life that they used to have before the calamity. Their children, oblivious to the before the war, struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>A great concept and full of vitriol for consumerism, this story is a bit on the nose in its critique of consumerism, but definitely thought provoking. </p>

<h2>Precious Artifact ★</h2>

<p>During an existential battle between Terra and Proxima, a human terraforming engineer was sent to Mars to develop a colony there. For his years of labor, he was granted reunion with his family. But he wants to see what has come of earth. He insists on a trip, and is met there by a woman who shows him around. But he figures it out and forces Mary to reveal the truth. It quickly becomes clear that Terra lost the war, the woman is from Prox, and that everything he has been seeing is an illusion. His family is all dead, all human females too. All that survived are cats and dogs. </p>

<p>This story is all about layered deception. As a twist on an already tragic turn of events, it turns out that not even his newly gifted cat is real, merely a simulacrum. Everything is calculated by the Prox state, and there is a level of truth that is beyond anyone's grasp. </p>

<p>(As I sit here at home for days without seeing my parents and friends, I am starting to feel something unsettling creep in. What if all of these video calls are fake? This is another PKD story in the making.)</p>

<h2>A Game of Unchance</h2>

<p>Another Martian colony theme but wildly different from the others. A space-carnival arrives on Mars and the bored colonists end up losing a fortune in the carnival. Anticipating a return, they train up a psi wielding child to trick the carnival games and win big. This pans out but the spoils are tiny autonomous robots that the colonists accidentally activate, leading to mayhem. Interplan come and shut the village down. After a time the carnival returns. This time the winnings are a way to destroy the previous gift. It's as if the carnies had planned this all along. </p>

<h2>We can remember it for you wholesale</h2>

<p>A family man has an unfulfillable dream, an idea fix: to go to Mars. But he has no time and too many obligations. Luckily, there is a way out: he can hire a company to implant false memories about how he'd gone to Mars already, surely that will satisfy him? The company decides to implant the idea that he was a secret agent and sent to mars to kill a rebellion leader. As the man is placed under sedation to begin the memory grafting procedure, but then his real memories return to him: indeed he'd been to mars already as a secret agent and murdered a rebellion leader as instructed by his handlers. </p>

<p>As he realizes this, more and more memories return. Things get a bit silly, as every false memory that is about to be implanted turns out to be actually true. A clever reversal of the usual pattern of false memories which feel true but are false. </p>

<h2>Faith of our Fathers ★</h2>

<p>Great combination of religion, communism and science fiction. Set in an alternative future where China wins the Cold War, a young ambitious but cynical cadre is rising through the ranks of the CCP. A series of events lead him to take some drugs, and during a boring mandatory speech from the Great Leader, he sees a hallucination of the leader as a terrifying machine. But it turns out the drugs are actually sedatives that suppress his usually hallucinating state. It’s in the air and the water.</p>

<p>His boss presents him with a purity test comparing two essays. A new friend wants to understand more about the great leader and tells him how to tell the correct essay from the false one. (Incidentally they both feature good poems: one from 1001 tales, another a Song for St. Cecilias Day). As he gets promoted through the ranks, he is invited to a dinner party hosted by the great leader. Clandestinely, he takes that same anti-hallucinatory drug and sees the leader for who he truly is: God. He is both good and evil, and he doesn't give a fuck, mortally wounding the protagonist.</p>

<p>Cinematically, the cadre returns to his apartment feeling nihilistic, and, divulging news about the leader to his new girlfriend, dies from his injuries while loving her for the first time. </p>

<p>Powerfully written but somewhat incoherent. I bet PKD was super high writing this one. </p>

<h2>The Electric Ant</h2>

<p>A man has a workplace injury and loses his hand. The surgeon informs him that the hospital can do nothing to graft his hand back on, because he is a robot. Dick’s description of robotic technology is really quaint, involving lots of tape and visible circuits and whirring motors and such. </p>

<p>Anyway it's not so much about the fact that the man is a robot, but that he realizes that he can self-tinker and change his own perception by reprogramming various internal tapes and circuits. By punching a few extra holes in his tape he can see a park bench appear in his room, or a flock of ducks. Eventually he commits suicide by snipping his tape in a failed experiment. And as it turns out, in a somewhat juvenile “then he woke up” twist, his own subjectivity was intimately tied to everyone else's. A bit of a solipsistic mind-fuck, this one. </p>

<h2>A Little Something for Us Tempunauts</h2>

<p>One of the weaker stories in the collection, and thoroughly confusing because it's time travel related (never goes well). Set in an era of pioneer time travellers in the US, very much analogous to the Moon craze. A group of three time travellers suffer a fatal accident as they advance insufficiently far into the future and die. As they travel forward in time, they stop to see what their funeral processions are like.</p>

<p>The story takes a bizarre turn when it turns out that they want to be perpetually stuck in a time loop to relive their glory forever. And somehow they bring the rest of earth into this time loop with them. Shrug?</p>

<h2>The Exit Door Leads In</h2>

<p>In an Idiocracy-like future, a promising young Mr. Bibleman is noticed by the system, and wins a golden ticket to enrol in a military college. The sergeant administrator gives an introductory speech, indicating that students are not to be exposed to classified information. Bibleman is forced into a major focusing on pre-Socratic philosophy, which bores him. But on his very first day, he stumbles upon schematics for secret classified Panther Drive, which turns out to be general purpose technology for generating cheap energy. If released to the general public, such technology would be a boon to many suffering people. Should he leak it? What would the consequences be?</p>

<p>He is quickly caught by the sergeant, and forced to make a decision on an accelerated timeframe. Under pressure, he returns the printout out of a sense of loyalty, although it’s a tough decision for him. Disappointed, the sergeant boots him from the college. He should have made an independent judgement and leaked the memo instead. The whole College was a setup intended to filter out independent thinkers from conformists.</p>

<p>PKD makes a provocative claim: society self destructed because of complacency and rule following. Fuck loyalty and think for yourself. Surprisingly non-subtle and didactic, but an effective way to deliver the message.</p>

<h2>Rutavaara’s Case</h2>

<p>After resuscitating Rutavaara, one of the three person crew who died in an astronautics accident, the Proxians watch her mind’s eye replay her last living moments. But this time, Jesus Christ is also apparent. It's funny already, just because of the irreverent way in which Philip K. Dick uses Christ. In a bizarre twist, the Proxians decide to take advantage of the opportunity and introduce their own version of Christ into Rutavaara’s dream. Christ died for our sins, but the Proxian Christ (a sort of anti-Christ) kills for your sins, and so it was in Rutavaara’s terrifying mind. Instead of taking communion, you get eaten.</p>

<p>Interestingly written as a sort of apology from the Proxian perspective. The narrator appears to apologize to their deity. He concludes that the earthlings are thoroughly wrong about their umwelt. Meanwhile PKD is sitting and observing both bizarre theologies, and laughing.</p>

    <title>Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I liked this book, a succinct refutal of a bunch of tropes associated with innovation, littered with nice analogies and good quotes, and mercifully short.</p>

<p>At any point, innovation can only occur at the edge of possibility, at the <strong>adjacent possible</strong>. If you’re not bold enough, it’s already been done. Too bold and you’re ahead of your time. This model nicely explains why important discoveries are often arrived at simultaneously by multiple discovers in different places (called <strong>multiples</strong>).</p>

<p>Johnson describes environments conducive to innovation as <strong>liquid networks</strong>. In a gas, atoms are far apart and chaotic. They may collide, but they won’t stick. In a solid, atoms are too constrained and won’t have a chance to interact at all. A prehistoric human society is like a gas: ideas may form but the lifestyle is too chaotic for anything to stick. Religious autocracies of the European Dark Ages and post-Enlightenment Arab world are like a solid: society is too restrictive to even let ideas form in the first place.</p>

<p>In general, Johnson rejects the narrative of the Eureka moment, attributing success to <strong>slow hunches</strong>, which take a long time to brew in a person’s mind. In a liquid network, multiple slow hunches have a good chance of meeting, and an insightful person can combine the two into a coherent idea.</p>

<p>The author compares the web to cities and coral reefs, both as examples of productive, dense, liquid networks where entities flow freely. Citing <a href="/books/scale-by-geoffrey-west/">Scale by Geoff West</a>, he notes that big cities aren’t just proportionally more inventive than small ones, but super-linearly so, with higher per-capita output. Just like cities allow free mingling of people and their ideas, the web enables this for the whole world serving like a “dating service for promising hunches”, increasing <strong>serendipity</strong>.</p>

<p>The way to nurture a slow hunch is to take copious amounts of notes, as evidenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">Commonplace books</a> (new to me), which became popular during the European Renaissance, popularized by Locke. Charles Darwin’s commonplace book is mentioned quite a bit as an example.</p>

<p>The “missed connection” example he provides in a non-liquid network are two hunches that could have met to stop the 9/11 aircraft hijackings, but never did due to the solid-like FBI bureaucracy.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Memo">Phoenix Memo</a> advising about bin Laden’s coordinated effort to send students to US aviation schools.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacarias_Moussaoui">Moussaoui’s</a> arrest at a flight training school in Minnesota.</li>
</ol>

<p>Continuing the analogy of liquid networks and water, Johnson lauds <strong>desirable spillover</strong> from one group of humans to another, encouraging cross-pollination of ideas, and a multidisciplinary approach. Examples of this include Building 20 at MIT, the “womb of the institute”, a temporary building that was at the heart of hacker culture, discoveries like LIGO, and great companies like Bose. By having a place that breeds so much intellectual diversity, you can imagine ideas crossing boundaries. When one idea goes from one domain to another, it’s called <strong>exaptation</strong>. For example, Gutenberg’s printing press borrowed the screw press mechanism, which was used for pressing olives into oil and grapes into wine.</p>

<p>Naturally, as ideas form and evolve, many leads go nowhere. Edison said “I didn't fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” At this point, this is definitely a cliche.</p>

<p>The book concludes with a series of 2x2 tables showing four kinds of inventions (borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks">Wealth of Networks</a>):</p>

<pre><code>+------------+------------+---------+
|            | Individual | Network |
+------------+------------+---------+
| Market     | 1          | 2       |
+------------+------------+---------+
| Non-market | 3          | 4       |
+------------+------------+---------+
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Market / individual: solo entrepreneur or private corporation.</li>
<li>Market / network: marketplace with multiple individuals.</li>
<li>Non-market / individual: hobby or amateur scientist, sharing ideas freely.</li>
<li>Non-market / network: open source or academic env where ideas can be built on freely.</li>
</ol>

<p>Quadrant 1 occupies the popular imagination: instigated by solo inventor driven by profit like Edison, or in this case he picks on Carrier, inventor of the modern air conditioner. But in an analysis of inventions from 15th century until the present, Johnson concludes that most inventions fall into quadrant 4, the non-market network. </p>

<p>The author doesn’t do a convincing job of explaining why each invention falls into each quadrant, and in many cases I think the call is very subjective, but the framework is interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>Johnson ends in an interesting take on Darwin’s work. Darwin’s big idea is often popularized as <strong>survival of the fittest</strong>, but Darwin himself makes clear that the right environment is perhaps even more important. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef#Darwin's_paradox">In The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</a>, published in 1842, Darwin described how coral reefs were found in some tropical areas but not others, with no obvious cause. Tropical waters contain few nutrients yet a coral reef can flourish like an "oasis in the desert”, supporting over one-quarter of all marine species. His seminal work concludes with this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/lost-enlightenment-by-frederick-starr"/>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I first learned of this book after a quick conversation with Mark, whom I’ve only met once in-person. I was just finishing Debt, and found the book intriguing, especially the parts about the monetary systems in Islamic societies. Mark suggested this book, and indeed it covers a period of history that I know basically nothing about. With my interest piqued already, I decided to take the plunge.</p>

<p>This book was both broad and deep, covering an era from about 750 (a nominal end of the Arab conquest) through 1150 (roughly the time when intellectual fruits of the enlightenment were starting to wilt). It is well written, so in the moment you think you understand what’s happening, but afterwards it turns out that everything is really complicated.</p>

<p>My overall feeling after reading this book is that it serves well as a comprehensive introduction to the topic. But the topic is quite complex, and as a complete noob, I found myself struggling a little bit. As I write this summary, I constantly have to consult Wikipedia to understand the region and its civilizational chronology. Keeping track of the giant cast of ancient Arab, Turkish, and Mongol characters that the author presents is also a challenge. On the other hand, the introduction really hooked me and the first half of the book flowed very well. I did come close to abandoning the book about 3/4 through, especially since the Turkish empires just before the Mongol invasion seemed to be somewhat dull from both action and cultural perspectives. But it picks up again with Genghis Khan and Timur and their respective empires, and then the conclusion does a great job of tying it all together. I listened to the last chapter twice!</p>

<p>I don't know why, but these Soviet stamps of great Islamic scientists are really
appealing:</p>

<p><img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/al-kwarizmi.png"/>
<img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/al-biruni.png"/>
<img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/ibn-sina.png"/></p>

<h1>Where: cities and regions</h1>

<p>I left myself a TODO as I was summarizing: “understand all of the cities/regions? mentioned in this book, put them on a map. Who would have been living there at the time? And maybe one day visit them.” So far, I only have <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r3caNCqtH91TXpF2rug03XzKByZ1BkdL&amp;usp=sharing">a Google map</a>, but it’s a start! The trip may have to wait for global pandemics and regional instabilities to wane.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, it was never clear which name corresponded to a city, and which to a region. Trying to resolve this online isn’t that simple. One is confounded by inconsistent Latinization. Khwarazm has been known also as Chorasmia, Khaurism, Khwarezm, Khwarezmia, Khwarizm, Khwarazm, Khorezm, Khoresm, Khorasam, Kharazm, Harezm, Horezm, and Chorezm. </p>

<p>Here’s a crazy tidbit: by 1200, Merv (aka Marv, Merw, Mary, …) was the largest city in the world with possibly half a million souls. Thousands were employed just to maintain its irrigation systems. Yet I hadn’t even heard of the place. Much of central Asian architecture of the time was lost because buildings were not built out of stone but of more perishable materials. But the cities were huge and glorious for their time, according to eyewitnesses. </p>

<p>Later into the book, there were some familiar places mentioned which helped me anchor a bit. My dad’s business trips to Taskhent, Almaty in the heart of the region where some of my friends were born, as well as song references: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmfjt0DnfCs">Tian Shan mountains, lake Issik Kul</a>. I love it when I have multiple angles on the same concept. It feels like things snap into place!</p>

<h1>Why did the Islamic golden age happen?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Hardship and need for water meant complex irrigation systems required advances in science and technology.</li>
<li>Subsequent general prosperity (great harvests) meant intellectuals could devote time to science and art. </li>
<li>Social norms from pre-Islam: rulers needed to patronize the arts to show their greatness. </li>
<li>Religious pluralism: Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Zoroastrianism were common and coexisted. As Islamic scholars documented each prior culture, they adopted pieces of it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why did the golden age end?</h1>

<p>The author does a good job dismantling Sonia Brenkes’ argument that there was no decline, and that westerners are just culturally insensitive. I liked that. Starr illustrates a clear decline both quantitatively and qualitatively. He puts a lot of the blame on Sunni-Shia conflicts and restrictions in freedoms of expression. Universities languished while madrasas thrived. Printing took a very long time to be adopted. </p>

<p>The Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavids, Empires that followed Timur and the period covered in the book, were rich and powerful, but focused on aesthetics, art, and architecture over science. Many great books crumbled from neglect over this period. Europeans were the ones who launched efforts to preserve the ailing manuscripts. </p>

<p>The decline happened sometime around 1100. Starr enumerates many potential reasons for the decline, and rejects each in turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Climate change: the region’s climate hasn't changed much then to now. The efforts of the oasis irrigators were thwarted when the mongols came to power, but this was after the decline. </li>
<li>Innate tendencies of Mongols: mongols came well after the start of the decline so cannot be the cause. </li>
<li>Vasco de Gamma, because his sea route opened trade which impoverished the land routes: unlikely, since the sea route was encouraged by high tariffs and bandits along the land routes. Also intellectual decay came before economic decay. Great Caravanserai were built in 11 and 12th centuries.</li>
<li>Decline in patronage from rich nobles and split up of large empires into emirates: the same laws were in place during cultural vitality, same ability to donate to foundations. But at the point of decline, money went to madrasas and not individual creators. </li>
<li>The Turks sucked, but the Persians were awesome: There were definitely greats among the Turks though. </li>
<li>A decline of large empires: Timur’s was the last, but again this splintering happened well after the start of the decline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately the author decides the main reason for decline is a rift between Sunni and Shiite sects that led to a surge in intolerance. Rational thought and science was caught on the crossfire between the two. Great thinkers like Al-Ghazali gave firepower for restrictive legalistic interpretation of Sharia which led to tighter links between religion and statecraft. Also the rise of Sufism turned society to metaphysics and away from science.</p>

<h1>Great people and their ideas</h1>

<p>I didn’t get a great sense for the full impact of the intellectual output of Central Asia during this golden age. It still seems to me like the largest contributions were preserving Greek works, and popularizing Indian mathematics.</p>

<p>Great thinkers found themselves between three fundamental camps intuition, reason, and revelation. At first, reason reigned, math (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>) science (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a>) and medicine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna">Ibn Sina</a>) flourished, free thinkers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi">Al-Razi</a>) were given a platform, and strange Islamic-rationalist hybrids went to great extremes. Later, the mood changed and revelation became the last word (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali">Al-Ghazali</a>).</p>

<h2>Al-Kwarazmi’s mathematics</h2>

<p>Al-Khwarizmi (780 - 850) was a popularizer of mathematics and integrated the Indian invented decimal notation system into his works. He wrote practical books for tradesmen to apply mathematics to their craft, formalizing some algebraic manipulations. He and many others exemplified the sort of mathematical, physical, medical intellectual activity of the time.</p>

<h2>Extremely rational Islam!?</h2>

<p>For a time, reason was so revered in the Islamic world, that rationalist schools of Islamic theology emerged. The adherents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila">Muʿtazili</a> school are best known for rejecting the widely accepted doctrine of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, deducing that if the Quran is the word of God, he logically "must have preceded his own speech".</p>

<p>The movement reached its political height in 833 under Caliph al-Ma'mun, when Sunni and Shia scholars were punished, imprisoned, or even killed unless they conformed to Muʿtazila doctrine. The policy lasted for fifteen years, continuing through the reigns of al-Ma'mun's immediate successors.</p>

<h2>Ibn-Sina and Al-Biruni debate</h2>

<p>Ibn Sina (980 – 1037) and Al-Biruni (973 - 1050) were contemporaries and had a public debate which took place over many years and can be traced in their preserved letters. This feels very modern, western renaissance-y, and they dug deep into fundamental questions. If heat rises, how does the sun’s heat reach the earth? Was Aristotle right that planets have neither weight nor mass?</p>

<p>Biruni focused on physics and mathematics and reason. He was an empiricist at heart, and very practical. Biruni definitely has the author’s sympathies (and mine, of course), and seems like the winner on almost all counts. He seems ridiculously advanced in many ways, often having really good hunches for science that would be discovered 500 years later. Biruni suggested that maybe orbits could be elliptical, which was shocking given previous assumptions that movement can only be linear or circular. He somehow knew and wrote about fossils, which is very surprising given a recently <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/art-science-deep-time-conceiving-inconceivable-in-19th/id1246993791?i=1000464847732">Long Now talk</a>, which dates the first European fossil discoveries to the 19th century.</p>

<p>In many cases in the debate, Ibn Sina was right, like suggesting that light does not emanate from the eyes, as was the platonic ideal, but instead comes from the world. </p>

<h2>Al-Ghazali’s anti-rationalism</h2>

<p>Al-Ghazali (1058 - 1111) was a philosopher and theologian that studied with rationalists but adopted an anti-rationalist stance and sided with islamic mystics. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the sultanate became more extreme and intolerant, and Al-Ghazali gave them the theory on which to justify their politics, confidently suggesting that philosophers were apostates, and that even after a conversion to Islam, the subject may be a closeted unbeliever. Thus if a philosopher fell out of favor with authorities he could be labeled an apostate and effectively lynched.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali’s patron was killed, forcing him to change directions towards Sufism, a rising branch of Islamic mysticism. He justified his new path as the best possible life for all people with his characteristic zeal. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers">The Incoherence of the Philosophers</a>, Al-Ghazali solved many problems at once, explaining his popularity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Devastating weapons to use against philosophers.</li>
<li>Justified moving Sufism into central Muslim life.</li>
<li>Shifted political and intellectual atmosphere from philosophizing from first principles to sharia law.</li>
</ol>

<p>Al-Ghazali influences many theologians and philosophers, from Acquinas to Hume to Maimonides. </p>

<p>A wise modern science administrator once quipped, “an active scientist is always right, and the younger he is, the more right he is”. In contrast, Al-Ghazali wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important truths are already fully accessible in the Quran and Hadiths and are embodied in the Sharia. Faith, not science and rigorous thought, is the key to unlocking them. It it is most likely to appear among the elders (Aksakals) or Sufi masters whose lifelong pursuit of wisdom gives them the right and duty to teach the young. Let them impart wisdom, and let the young listen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Omar Khayyam</h2>

<p>Omar Khayyam was a great scientist and mathematician from Nishapur, active during the Seljuk era. It was only in his old age and exile from Merv, he turned to wine and poetry for which he is most known today. He watched in horror Al-Ghazali rose to prominence.</p>

<h1>Chronology</h1>

<p>Most of what follows is chronological-ish summary of what happened in the region before, during, and after the Islamic enlightenment.</p>

<h2>Before the Arab conquest (pre-622)</h2>

<p>This was the time of the first mounted horses, the first saddles in the first stirrups. This gave the Central Asians huge advantage over chariots. In addition it made them more mobile and nomadic. However these were not the stereotypical nomads that conflicted with city dwellers. These peoples needed goods that would come from cities, and the author paints a rather convivial picture of the two groups of people living in relative harmony. Central Asian cities were large and flexible in relation to Mediterranean cities which were quite fragile and small.
￼￼￼￼￼
Due to the harsh conditions of the region, engineers really needed to build solid irrigation systems. And the public understood this, and so technocrats were elevated in status. A lot of technical domains involved passing knowledge down from generation to generation, as a result of these professions were often practiced by groups of ethnically homogeneous people. For example glassblowing was predominantly Jewish practice. The pre-Islamic Central Asians were super literate. Sadly, little is left of that era because the Arabs burned a lot of their books in their invasion. ￼￼￼</p>

<p>The arid conditions were such that cities had to be built around oases which were pretty far spaced from one another. This meant that you couldn't really have large empires, as in Egypt for example all along the Nile.</p>

<p>Zoroastrianism was dominant in the area and had a huge impact on major world religions. I know nothing about it other than that “Thus Spake Zarathustra” song. Apparently Zoroaster invented the idea of heaven, hell, and redemption.</p>

<p>By 800, Roman roads were no longer needed and fell into disrepair. Instead, camels were very actively used for transport of goods but they couldn't carry as much weight as wheeled carts so trade skewed towards materials that were especially valuable and not particularly heavily. This is the “silk road”, although silk was just one of many goods, including lapis lazuli, emeralds, gold and other precious metals, ferried across this route. Dromedary or single humped camel's were phased out in favor of Bactrian (two hump) camels who are more hardy.</p>

<h3>Fate of old books</h3>

<p>Interesting trend of book burning by conquering civilizations. A Chinese dynasty referred to in Debt also burned all records kept before them. And the conquering Muslims burned huge swaths of history, impeding historians even today. But not all book destruction was so sudden, a lot of Islamic enlightenment books were simply allowed to decompose through neglect.</p>

<h2>Arab conquest (622-661)</h2>

<p>First the conquest in Central Asia proceeded slowly. Over centuries it rolled out, also stunted by internal conflict within the Islamic faith, the schism between followers of Mohameds direct line and the Ussayids.  Echoes of which continue to this day with the Sunni Shia rift. </p>

<h3>Islamic schism cheat sheet</h3>

<p>After Muhammad’s death, a schism emerged in Islam: who can lead the Muslim world? Two main factions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any Muslim can lead (Umayyad Caliphate, 661 - 750). Now known as Sunni (HQ: Saudi Arabia)</li>
<li>Only blood descendants of Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law and appointed heir, can lead (Abbasid Caliphate, 750 - 1258). Now known as Shia (HQ: Iran)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Umayyads (661 - 750)</h2>

<p>A particularly vicious conqueror <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutayba_ibn_Muslim">Qutayba ibn Muslim</a> (Umayyad) set out to finally quell central Asian forces. He was uncharacteristically brutal, likely out of a lack of self confidence. He was responsible for burning whole libraries of Zoroastrian works at Buchara, and killing and enslaving thousands brutally. Seeking certainty, Qutayba asked his forces to swear fealty to him, and was met with silence, only to be murdered days later. </p>

<p>Following Qutayba came a more moderate governor and general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasr_ibn_Sayyar">Nasr ibn Sayyar</a> who undid some of the more draconian policies, but only after a series of terrible mistakes which alienated the indigenous population, by first levying a tax on non Muslims, then having a mass conversion which undid the tax base, and then a law which forced men to prove their faith by undergoing circumcision.</p>

<h2>Abbasids (750 - 1258)</h2>

<p>Ultimately a general named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Muslim">Abu Muslim</a> consolidated a lot of power in Central Asia, was quite heterogenous in his faith and grew a large coalition army consisting mostly of central Asians. Ultimately these forces obliterated the remaining Umayyads in Damascus and quelled the Chinese forces to the East. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mansur">Al-Mansur</a> was selected to rule the Abbasids, who were at this point concerned about Abu Muslim’s faith and loyalty. Mansur was a hard liner and didn't trust Abu Muslim, ultimately having him killed in hopes of stamping out any form of Shiism and quelling Central Asian influence. He dumped Abu Muslim’s body in the Tigris. This effectively martyred the man, who was extremely popular, and led to many more rebellions against the already unpopular Abbasid rulers. Many of these claimed to be in Abu Muslim’s blood line, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Muqanna">Al-Muqanna</a>, famously wearing a green face mask, inspiring stories by Borges and Moore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much the way Greek culture eventually conquered a triumphant Rome, Central Asian culture was now in position to conquer the Abbasids and their new capital, Baghdad. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Baghdad modeled after Merv (762)</h3>

<p>The most culturally important city of the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_city_of_Baghdad">Baghdad</a> was essentially a planned circular city, likely modelled after Merv’s administrative centre, with Merv-imported architects and craftsmen central in the planning and construction. It was built my Al-Mansur, the same Abassids caliph that killed Abu Muslim. Parts of the city were named in honor of Merv too, including a street and a quarter. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>, Al-Mansur’s grandson eventually became caliph. His leadership coincided with a golden age in Baghdad, exemplified by the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>, the Grand Library of Baghdad. His rise to power was in part sponsored by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmakids">Barmakids</a>, a very rich family of central Asian heritage and with deep Buddhist roots. They were great sponsors of science, medicine, and philosophy. They are most famously known for having translated large numbers of classic Greek texts into Arabic.</p>

<p>Translations were selective. Only Greek texts, no Latin works were translated. Also no tragedies, history, or drama was translated, mostly focused on philosophy and medicine and science. </p>

<p>Baghdad has a glorious phase as described in 1001 nights, but descended into a regression that lasted several generations. Ultimately it's golden age was relatively short lived and the cultural and scientific centre shifted back to central Asian cities. </p>

<h3>Decline of Baghdad (808)</h3>

<p>Baghdad's golden age was short. The new caliph realized that Central Asia would need its autonomy and expanded the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan">Khorasan</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahir_ibn_Husayn">Tahir</a>, his appointed governor. Tahir promptly declared independence and Khorasan continued to be a client state, paying tribute to Baghdad but largely autonomous. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Khorasan comprised the present territories of northeastern Iran, parts of Afghanistan and much of Central Asia. The province was often subdivided into four quarters. Nishapur (present-day Iran), Marv (present-day Turkmenistan), Herat and Balkh (present-day Afghanistan) were the centers, respectively, of the westernmost, northernmost, southernmost, and easternmost quarters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tahir’s son took over after his deceased father and instituted broad minded educational reforms, insisting that even the poor farmers need to be educated. Simultaneously, there was some unrest among the patricians of the city. The rift was around a more or less literal interpretation of the Quran, but ultimately which of the two camps would wield power over the other. Ultimately the whole land owning class gently self destructed. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur">Nishapur</a> was the cultural capital in the 9th century, and on the backdrop described above, much philosophical activity ensured. From hardcore Islamist literalists to militant atheists, to Aristotelian rationalists that were still fervent Muslims. </p>

<p>A populist band of brothers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%27qub_ibn_al-Layth_al-Saffar">Ya'qub</a> and his younger led a rebellion against the Abbasid caliph, threatening Baghdad. Barely Islamic at all, this band restored even more autonomy to the central Asian area of Khorasan. Eventually defeated, he and his younger brother briefly formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffarid_dynasty">Saffarid dynasty</a>, autonomous large chunk of Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Samanid Empire (819 – 999)</h2>

<p>Samanid state was founded by four brothers; Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas. Each took control over a large city in the region. Ultimately one of them took over but did so bloodlessly, removing just brothers from power without killing them.</p>

<p>The Samanid allowed for a more diverse cultural base, keeping Arabic but also allowing indigenous languages: Persian, Turkic. This ultimately paved the way for more Turkish influence in the region.</p>

<h2>The Kara-Khanids (990 - 1040)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Khanid_Khanate">Kara-Khanids</a>, Turkish nomads began moving west. As the Samanid empire was declining, they made easy targets. They converted to Islam (from their native Tengrism) but weren't especially religious. Where they invaded Central Asia from the east and gained control over large chunks of it, they erected incredibly tall minarets known as victory towers, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyan_minaret">Kalyan minaret</a>. They were mostly militaristic and remained true to their steppe culture. </p>

<p>This is also a time of Turkish nationalism and a general popularization of the Turkic languages. Their capital was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasagun">Balasagun</a> (now destroyed), but the empire extended quite far west, into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand">Samarkand</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termez">Termez</a>.</p>

<h2>The Seljuk Empire (1037 – 1194)</h2>

<p>The Seljuks were a Turkish people that originated near the Aral Sea, but expanded westward, taking Khorasan, and eventually going as far west as to conquer most of Anatolia.</p>

<p>Sanjar, The last ruler of the Seljuks favored monumental architecture, which turned out to be quite influential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Ahmed_Sanjar">Sanjar’s tomb</a> inspired the Duomo in Florence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral">Isaakievskiy Sobor</a> in St. Petersburg, and the Capitol Building in Washington DC.</p>

<h2>Mongol Invasions (1219 - 1370)</h2>

<p>Genghis Khan had no initial plan to conquer Khwarezm. He sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor. Hoping to unify Turks and Mongols under one nomadic banner ("people in felt tents”), Genghis Khan successfully conquered other nomadic peoples with relatively little bloodshed. To establish trade ties, Genghis sent a 500-man caravan, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalchuq">governor of Otrar</a> had them arrested as spies and executed the entire party with the Shah’s support. </p>

<p>The mongols were swift and ruthless in their revenge. Genghis Khan besieged Otrar in 1219, which resisted for five months and then fell. In the ensuing war, lasting less than two years, the Khwarezmid Empire was destroyed. The Mongols ruled</p>

<h2>Timurid Empire (1370 - 1507)</h2>

<p>Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage, established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>By 1500, the Timurid empire was in decline due to infighting and pressure from Safavids and Ottomans. Babar, who claimed to be Genghis Khan’s descendant from father, and Timur’s descendant from mother, founded the Mughal empire which ruled over India. The three major Islamic empires split between them most of the Islamic world.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many open questions and lingering threads remain, as well as directions for further exploration.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’d never heard of the epic poem Shahnameh, but it seems to differ from its Greek predecessors by being more inward looking and existential in nature. Worth a looksee if there are good translations.</li>
<li>Read the Borges stories “The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv”, and “The Zahir”.</li>
<li>Read something by Omar Khayyam. Maybe “The Rubaiyat”?</li>
<li>The first poem in Lalla-Rookh (1817) by Thomas Moore is “The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan”.</li>
</ul>

    <title>Debt: The First 5000 Years</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>“Debt” has been on my reading list for a long time. I once attempted the hard copy, but abandoned it quickly. It was mentioned again on a podcast by Saul Griffith, just as I was starting to get interested in the role of financing advances in innovation and progress. So I decided to give it another shot. This is the second edition of the book, updated after the financial crisis and after the 99% protest movement, which the author helped organize.</p>

<p>My overall feeling is that I learned a lot. The author, Graeber, is an anthropologist, and clearly erudite in a lot of adjacent fields as well. On the flip side, especially toward the end, the author’s personal beliefs became too prominent, at times transforming informative book into angry screed. Understandably, this detracted from the credibility of the book.</p>

<h1>Moral confusion around debt</h1>

<p>Graeber starts many chapters of the book with awesome quotes. Here’s one: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you owe the bank one hundred thousand, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank one hundred million, you own the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Graeber describes how small-scale societies were based on mutual obligation, but as they grew and matured, debt became identified with money, became more transferrable from one person to another organization, to a yet larger one. Every step in that chain becomes less personal and more cruel. This may be the case, but it remains unclear to me that we can do better given the scale of our current societies.</p>

<p>Interestingly, many monetary systems are based on a small group of creditors giving out a large loan to the government that is then never repaid. This is true of Britain today, where the system nominally rests on a 1 million pound loan given by a few wealthy merchants many centuries ago. </p>

<h1>Myth of barter</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong. – H. L. Mencken</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the afterword, Graeber reflects on the book and suggests that this chapter was his strongest. I agree: it is least rambling, most concrete and informative.</p>

<p>Barter is often imagined as a prehistoric mode of exchange by economists, as a precursor to money. A point out that a society that employed barter would require a two sided marketplace for each transaction (eg. I want shoes but have pencils, so need to find a shoe vendor that wants pencils specifically). The way out is to create a multilateral deal, or invent a medium of exchange (money). </p>

<p>Except there are no known societies that employ barter internally. This is where Graeber’s anthropology background really comes in handily. Barter tends to be used between strangers, and typically as a single turn game, not a repeated one. </p>

<p>In fact, the system that predates bullion wasn’t barter, but one of lending and ledgers. This was the dominant system in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Coins came later and were relatively unimportant for a long time.</p>

<h1>Wizard of oz</h1>

<p>Apparently there is an economics reading of the Wizard of Oz: </p>

<p>The Wicked Witches of the East and West are the coastal banking elites. The scarecrow is the prototypical farmer that gets screwed over but doesn't have the brains to address the underlying issue. The tin man is the proletarian worker who doesn't have the heart to side with the farmer. The lion is the political elite that doesn't have the courage to step out of rank. And they all march to the White House. The Emerald City is full of greenbacks, and many other gems refer to the proposed silver standard. All of it is a parable for William Jennings Brian's attempt at presidency and the first marches on the White House.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">Turns out</a> this isn’t Graeber’s invention.</p>

<h1>Primordial debt</h1>

<p>Graeber explores the link between monetary debt and its predecessor, spiritual debt. Linguistically, the two concepts are deeply intertwined, most strikingly, German “gelt” and English “guilt” share a root (many other examples in book).</p>

<p>In a sense, you owe your existence to your parents, to society, and ultimately to God. But this is a debt you can never fully repay, although you must try anyway. Would you want to be square with your parents? If even possible, That implies you want nothing to do with them. Graeber’s take is that our relationship with cosmos is ultimately nothing like a commercial transaction. </p>

<p>Here, we tend towards a more philosophical exploration. I enjoyed it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are free from your debt to your ancestors when you become an ancestor; you are free from your debt to the sages when you become a sage, you are free from your debt to humanity when you act with humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Morality and economics</h1>

<p>Communism as defined by “for each according to their needs, from each according to ability” is often practiced in smaller units, most notably the family, but not successfully in large scale societies.</p>

<p>Giving gifts to low status folks is fraught. You risk putting them down because there’s no way for them to pay you back. Conversely, giving gifts to superiors is fraught too. What can you really give to a king? It often leads to an expectation of such gifts and ultimately a tradition of tribute. Even to peers, gift giving can often be competitive. A fancy meal is met with a fancier meal.</p>

<p>At the same time, being slightly indebted to peers is a great way to build social cohesion. It feels like in western society many don't often feel indebted to other individuals, only to institutions. </p>

<h1>History of honor</h1>

<p>I struggled a bit with this chapter. Graeber drives at this idea that commerce is inherently based on violence, and is deeply rooted in slavery. This is where Graeber’s personal opinions start muddying the waters and the going gets tough for the first time. But he recovers and there’s more meat to be had.</p>

<h1>Money vs debt</h1>

<p>Currency and more traditional debt and credit system arrangements came in and out of fashion over time. Money correlated to periods of war, because it was a time of mass mobilization, and having currency made it easier to pay soldiers. Credit systems flourished during periods of peace because they relied on trust networks to operate.</p>

<p>Many forms of currency existed before bullion (gold and silver). Cowrie shells were commonly used as money in China and other societies. Coins were first invented in Anatolia around 600 BCE by private citizens. Almost immediately they were adopted by the state. Same pattern repeats in other civilizations.</p>

<p>Coins and silver bars were mostly controlled by the rich, mostly stored in temples for religious purposes. But during times of conquest they were broken up and split up among warriors. Alexander the Great’s forces numbered 120,000 and had a daily wage of half a ton of silver! When he conquered, he coined new money from Assyrian reserves to pay his army. </p>

<p>In India, Ashoka began his rule by conquering a neighbor, one of the last independent Indian states. He won the war but at a huge cost of hundreds of thousands of deaths, and vowed never to fight again. Coinage began to dwindle and was replaced by system of credits. </p>

<p>Origins of interest are unknown but it was already happening by 2500 BCE in Mesopotamia! In the ancient world, a jubilee ritual of “breaking the tablets”, annulling all debts was done on a semi-regular basis. Jubilee was also demanded by peasant uprisings and granted by kings to mollify the people. </p>

<h1>Axial age</h1>

<p>(Interestingly, I am attempting to tackle a series of lectures on this topic. Haven’t made much progress yet, but this angle was specifically financial.)</p>

<p>Coined by Karl Jaspers, the Axial Age is a period around 800 BCE to 200 BCE marking a sudden beginning of reasoned inquiry. A wide range of positions in philosophy suddenly bloomed simultaneously in many places. Consider the lifespans of a few but diverse philosophers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pythagoras - 570-495 BC</li>
<li>Buddha - 563-483 BCE </li>
<li>Confucius - 551-479 BCE</li>
</ul>

<p>Graeber extends his timespan to 600 CE, also including the “spiritual age” when Jesus and Mohamed and the Rabbinical tradition came into being. These were times of war, and transactions needed to be anonymous. Luckily, cash enabled this, and radically simplified all of the complex dynamics of trust-based systems. This led to the cold, hard, rational calculations and a profusion of new concepts: profit and loss.</p>

<p>Interestingly, with the advent of both impersonal greed and philosophical thought, religious spheres emerged, promulgating the idea that giving is better than taking, common to all religions of the axial age including Buddhism, Christianity, Islam. This is when the concept of Charity first enters the picture.</p>

<h1>Middle Ages</h1>

<p>The Middle Ages have a bad rap, but this is in large part because of the way that they are often presented in stark opposition to the renaissance, oftentimes by people living in the renaissance. The terms themselves are illuminating: a dark age turned into an era of rebirth!</p>

<p>True, cities like London and Paris which blossomed during the renaissance, were just remote outposts of the Roman Empire. When the empire fell, these cities returned to their prior obscurity. And even in these frontier towns, records were continued to be kept in Roman currencies. Meanwhile Rome and Constantinople flourished. </p>

<p>Around the same time in India, Buddhism was flourishing and monasteries were funded by permanent trusts where the principal was lent out at a steep (15%) yearly interest rate. This was super surprising to me, since I’ve associated trusts like these with modernity.</p>

<p>In China, paper money emerged out of convenience in the 10th century. Rather than carrying strings of coins, which incidentally is why coins had a hole in the middle — to thread a string through for ease of carry, merchants traveling long distances preferred to carry less so developed a system of stamped paper notes. These were initially rejected by Chinese authorities, but being unable to control the practice adequately, they ultimately created a bureau to regulate the practice. A common pattern for China. </p>

<h2>The Arab world</h2>

<p>Graeber considers the Arab world at this time as basically western, an intellectual successor to the Greeks and Romans. Just like Middle Eastern Europe (then in shambles), the Arab world was attempting to synthesize the greek tradition with the prophets of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In stark contrast, the East was completely different. Super interesting 10,000 foot view.</p>

<p>Islam was super progressive for its time, addressing many of the injustices of the Axial Age. This included prohibitions against kidnapping into slavery, and also the hard stance against usury. But despite that, Islam had no issue with commerce in general, Mohamed himself at one point working as a merchant. Early Muslim states flourished economically and had banks that charged fees rather than compounding interest due to usury prohibitions. As a result, banking on its own wasn't a lucrative enough profession so many rich merchants doubled as banks for lesser brethren. Much of the economy was based on trust, and there was a real aversion to government interference in market mechanisms.</p>

<p>Apparently Adam Smith actually cites a lot of Persian economists. Smith’s pin factory is just a re-hashing of Al-Ghazali, who used the example of a needle factory to illustrate the same point. The pin doesn’t have a single maker, but twenty-five persons involved; these are all collaborating in the absence of a central planner. Adam Smith changed Al-Ghazali’s view that markets work because people like to co-operate to the view that market participants are only interested in selfish gain.  (Just how much of Smith was borrowed from Al-Ghazali and Al-Tusi is unclear from Graeber’s account, and he doesn’t make explicit claims here, but this is definitely one of those “this is why we can’t have nice things” with finger pointed at Americans.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Christendom, things were quite different. Markets came quite late and merchants as a profession were shunned by the church. All of Europe was a checkerboard of baronies and church holdings, with constant conflict reshaping the borders.</p>

<h1>The great capitalist empires</h1>

<p>After a long shift away from bullion, the age of exploration coincided with a reversion to money     Partly due to the influx of gold and silver from the new world. </p>

<p>During the enlightenment, an interesting trend: the dominance of bullion as a logical continuation of conservation laws coming from physics. “Newtonian economics” suggests that money cannot be created or destroyed, and that it needs an intrinsic anchor for its value. This wasn't really a consideration until the renaissance. </p>

<p>Locke himself advocated for this Gold Standard, which led to financial troubles. Hobbes meanwhile promulgated the natural selfishness of people and necessity for social contacts. </p>

<p>From this point onward, Graeber’s writing really becomes unbearable. His bias is too apparent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the secret scandal of capitalism that at no point was it organized primarily around free labor. The conquest of the Americas began with mass enslavement then gradually settled into debt peonage, African slavery and indentured service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does concede that the world is better today, but at a cost, making asinine comparisons between slavery and modern wage labor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no doubt that progress has produced an unprecedented improvement on the lives of billions over the last 250 years. But it's also unclear to me whether all of these improvements can be tied to capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The beginning of something to be determined…</h1>

<p>Nixon gets blamed for a lot of terrible things, including Vietnam. Is this fair, given that he inherited the war?</p>

<p>So many tropes! The US supposedly uses its military power to terrorize the world. US bonds are actually tribute, not loans. Many of his claims reek of edge-lordship, others come off sounding like conspiracy theories. China is apparently trying to turn the US into a client state. By giving tribute and lavish gifts to its clients, China has previously turned its nemeses into dependents. </p>

<p>Yeah, okay, maybe. I’m torn!</p>

    <title>Revenge of Analog</title>

      <![CDATA[

        <blockquote>
  <p>“Digital’s overwhelming superiority initially renders analog alternatives worthless, but over time the perception of value shifts and when the honeymoon with a particular technology ends we are more readily able to judge its true merits and shortcomings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very wordy, this is definitely a book to skim. The gist is that we’ve been overzealous about digitizing everything, and now analog is making a comeback in some areas. The book is a straightforward walkthrough of a few domains where this has been happening. The author does a good job of not sounding too crotchety, which is very easy to do in books like these. But this book has basically no insights. It’s more a summary of ideas that are all in the air.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The author presents a semi interesting study on Moleskine, colored by the character who helped cofound the company. There is indeed something that feels inherently good about taking paper notes. But not much insight beyond this. </p>

<p><strong>Board games</strong>: Turns out people are social! And the trend in video gaming is towards solo or online multiplayer, where you are fundamentally alone in a room. In contrast, with board games you're together with a bunch of friends and there's a lot more happening than just the game!</p>

<p><strong>Retail stores</strong> are still important. No surprises again, that Apple and other maintain store presence and support. And bookstores are a good example of tactile scanning and easy previews. Conspicuously absent are libraries. </p>

<p><strong>Work</strong>: As far as I can tell this is where the author complains about tech displacing blue collar jobs. Sadly, even vinyl pressers are going to be automated if the market grows. You'll need CNC experience not operators. </p>

<p><strong>Education</strong>: Attempts to reform education have all been made with advents in new technology. And so far the traditional school classroom approach seems to be giving best results. This is a good reminder for me to ensure that my daughter ends up in a tech-free classroom. I found this quote to be oddly satisfying, and felt sorry for Thrun</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thrun predicted that MOOCs would be so distributive that in 50 years only ten institutions in the world would provide higher education and his would be one of them. Apparently a lesson about Icarus’s journey to the sun wasn't included on the Udacity syllabus.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the idea that camp Walden doesn't allow any tech for its campers.</p>

<p>Overall, this book could easily be compressed into a 10 minute article. I found no new ideas in this book, just an occasional head nod: confirmation.</p>

    <title>Visual Chronology of Science &amp; Discovery</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>As Newton wrote, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants”. But whose giant shoulders did Newton stand on? And did those giants stand on the shoulders of other giants? And how about Newton’s successors, or people working in other fields? As far as I can tell, it’s giants all the way down.</p>

<p>Last year, I got my hands on a remarkable book, <a href="/books/asimovs-chronology-of-science-and-discovery/">Asimov’s Chronology of Science and Discovery</a>. It inspired me to produce a visual summary of human ingenuity, to see what one giant saw from the shoulders of another. After some experimentation, I turned it into an interactive visualization. You can play with it <a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape#steel">here</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape/#steel"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-steel.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Steel." /></a></p>

<!--more-->

<p>One of the unnerving things about Isaac Asimov’s book was the visual table of contents for the first edition:</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/original-visualization.jpg" alt="Winding visualization of Asimov’s Chronology in the first edition." /></p>

<p>Following this winding path is tricky to say the least. With this in mind, I carefully read the first quarter of the book, spanning from the beginning of time until 1700 CE, which amounts to about 300 entries, or about a quarter of those contained in the book. I took notes in a spreadsheet, providing a 1-2 sentence summary of each entry and manually extracting some key metadata. For each of Asimov’s entries, I captured the title, a couple sentences of description, the associated person’s name, and where the invention was created or discovery found, usually the country or empire.</p>

<p>In addition, I provided two extra fields which are more subjective and frankly, made up by yours truly, to bring the visualization to life: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Field</strong>: which domain was this discovery made. (How granular should this be? Should Science be split up into Chemistry, Physics, and Biology?)</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: what older inventions and discoveries enabled this one. (This can be really tricky.)</li>
</ol>

<p>With this in place, Asimov’s linear chronology becomes a directed graph, and since we don’t know how to time travel, there are no time cycles. So what we have is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph (DAG)</a>. It is not a tree since I allow each node to have multiple parents. For instance, the field of Geometry is built up logically from axioms. At the same time, the founding text of the field, Euclid’s Elements, is mostly derived work from many mathematicians working before Euclid in the Academy and Lyceum. So the DAG shows <strong>Geometry</strong> rooted both in <strong>Advanced Schools</strong> and <strong>Logic</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape/#geometry"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-geometry.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Geometry." /></a></p>

<h2>Manual entry is tiring</h2>

<p>Sadly, the Chronology is not available as a text-based ebook, which complicates matters. As it turns out, optical character recognition (OCR) is not easy if your content is laid out like a newspaper:</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/book-flow-ocr.jpg" alt="Excerpt of the book showing tricky text flow" /></p>

<p>Google Cloud Vision and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a> don’t do well on complex text flows, often failing to recognize section boundaries. For the image above, tesseract wrongly assumes that that the text flows in three full height columns.</p>

<p>I also tried to do automatic entity extraction using python’s <code>nltk</code> and <code>ne_chunk</code> to automatically generate inventors and locations but a quick experiment yielded too many entities for each entry, meaning that I’d have to make a manual pass regardless, and this step would provide minimal time savings.</p>

<h2>Playing cards and tech trees</h2>

<p>Each invention and discovery needs its own view. I gravitated to a card metaphor, which is often used in historical strategy games like Civ, role playing games like Diablo, and in many playing card games like Magic the Gathering. Here are a <a href="https://www.are.na/boris-smus/tech-tree-cards">few examples</a> that inspired me.</p>

<p>One challenge that I found ultimately insurmountable was to find good images for each entry. While you can find reams of royalty free images, and even download them automatically using tools like <a href="https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download">googleimagesdownload</a>, finding a set that is visually consistent was tough. I did this manually for the first hundred inventions. Theoretically a style transfer model might be able to convert them all to a consistent look. But ultimately, they didn’t add much value to the visualization as a whole, so I ditched the idea.</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/card-images.jpg" alt="Attempt to use images in the cards" /></p>

<h2>Chronological visualization</h2>

<p>To visualize the entries, I started with a naive approach: render all of the entries at once in a giant horizontal scrolling view, kind of like how tech trees work in Civilization-like games. Doing such a thing linearly makes no sense at all, since the first entry in the book is Bipedalis, dating to 4 million years ago (ma), followed by Stone Tools at 2 ma, Fire at 0.5 ma, then 8 entries later, Agriculture at 0.01 ma (10,000 years ago). This sort of timeline is best represented on a log-scale, which makes entries more reasonably spaced out, although still not perfect. Actually there’s quite a lot of variation in density. For example, this is the chronology of the first millennium CE (1000 years):</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/chrono-first-millennium.jpg" alt="Chronology of first millennium" /></p>

<p>While this is just the 16th century (100 years, an order of magnitude shorter than above):</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/chrono-sixteenth-century.jpg" alt="Chronology of 16th century" /></p>

<p>Even with the log-scale, inventions are by no means well distributed in time, with the 16th century far more visually dense than the first millennium. In both examples, links are especially obscure, since they often stretch out for many screens, and are basically impossible to trace from source to destination. </p>

<p>I tried variants of this view as well, involving collapsing entries into more compact default representations, and allowing them to be expanded for more detail. One promising variant involved expanding a selected entry and all transitively linked ones, but the predecessors and successors are still typically positioned far off-screen, so a lot of scrolling is required.</p>

<h2>Entry-centric visualization</h2>

<p>One of the shortcomings of a purely chronological view is that connections between entries are lost. Yet this is the most important part of this whole project, so I kept searching.</p>

<p>I opted for a more structured approach, one that lets you focus on a particular entry and at a glance see what technology led to it, and what technology it enabled. At the same time, I wanted to show the invention in its chronological context, in the spirit of Asimov’s book. So the current design takes a Cartesian approach, with one card centered at the origin, serving as the focus. Technologies that enabled the focused card are shown to the left and technologies that the focus enabled are shown to the right, along the x axis. Chronologically previous and next entries are shown along the y axis. </p>

<h2>Technology transcending fields</h2>

<p>Once the dependency graph is in place and each entry is associated with a field, one starts seeing interesting patterns in the data. </p>

<p>The discovery of magnetism lead to the invention of the compass, giving navigators confidence to traverse the ocean, in turn leading to the discovery of the new world:</p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape#compass"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-compass.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Compass." /></a></p>

<p>Melting glass beads and glass blowing enabled lens crafting and microscopes which in turn let careful observers see microorganisms in pond water, ultimately leading to great advances in medicine. </p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape#microscope"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-microscope.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Microscope." /></a></p>

<p>Cross field dependencies like the ones I described above are visualized as dashed red arrows.</p>

<h2>Please help complete this project</h2>

<p>This visualization is backed by a spreadsheet which is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDNXas7DzwglB95HV2_2u1utWAwBZR2hQHlMPz-fj5A/edit#gid=0">publicly viewable</a>, the result of a bunch of my own reading and summarizing. I’ve compiled a quarter of Asimov’s impressive tome by hand, but I’d love your help finishing the project.</p>

<p>If you’re game to help, here are the necessary pieces:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qQDnNQr6L-NGRTyID8kWGMnnVVPeCC6o/view?usp=sharing">PDF of the second edition of Asimov’s Chronology</a> I scanned in hopes of automating the whole process (see above).</li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDeBCfcaVUfZFEK-0WJIb43dT6cqHHq9o6Uxn6PihLY/edit#gid=158368026">publicly editable spreadsheet</a> containing stubs for all of the inventions listed in the chronology from 1700 to 1993.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please read a chunk of the latter quarter of the book (starting 1700) and contribute it to the public spreadsheet. I hope you will be as excited as I was to learn a whole lot about the history of science and compile it into this format. Once the project is complete, it will be glorious! </p>

<p>I’ll update this post as more of the spreadsheet is filled out. Meanwhile, thanks for reading and stay tuned – I have a few follow up posts in mind already.</p>

<p><strong>Update Feb 23</strong>: People seem to be interested in the project; excellent! I’ve <a href="https://github.com/borismus/asimov">open sourced</a> the visualization code.</p>

        <p>The Circle is a thinly veiled parable for, well, Big Tech. At base this book suggests what can happen when high modernism goes too far in the 2010 version of tech. </p>

<p>In some ways, the book feels dated. Even the most cynical observer today will agree that even Facebook is concerned with privacy, even if mainly to mitigate bad PR. Meanwhile the Circle is unabashedly techno utopian, extremely brash. I bet in 2014 when the book came out, it was culturally truer than it feels today. </p>

<p>The Circle slogans are especially on the nose: “All that happens must be known”, “To heal we must know. To know we must share.” And PartiRank? Ha! “Secrets are lies, privacy is theft,  sharing is caring”. I think Eggers is going for the 1984 vibe, but it’s just a little over the top.</p>

<p>Mercer’s antler art commodification episode was pretty effective. The whole Instagram influencer business Mae fell into is prescient. I don't think influencers ousting celebrities was as much of a trend at the time of writing. </p>

<p>Completing the circle feels analogous to building Communism, and a stark reminder that any ideology that tramples over your family and friends is probably bad news. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed the twist in the end. It was so well done from the moment that “Mae knew what she had to do” to Mae’s supposed aversion of the apocalypse, to the ultimate reveal of whose side she ultimately landed on. Other than the twist, the plot was predictable but immensely addictive anyway. I breezed through this book, but it definitely felt like junk food. Big thanks Mr. P for sending it to me!</p>

        <p>Collection of essays, from wistful to banal. Nothing that special. But I liked a few vignettes: the one about how each kid costs you a book. And about how baseball is nostalgia, nicely tying three generations of men. </p>

    <title>Smoke and Mirrors by Neil Gaiman</title>

        <p>I’ve never read Gaiman before, but his various works have frequented my to-read list. I wasn’t too thrilled by Sandman, but misattributed that feeling to the graphic novel medium. I abandoned this collection midway since the stories were often really boring or weirdly sexual. Even the best ones weren’t especially memorable or original. At first I optimistically found this unevenness appealing, like playing roulette. Half way through, I decided to cut my losses.</p>

<p>One of the better stories was hidden in the introduction, but was basically a riff on Picture of Dorian Gray. I also found “Troll”, “Chivalry”, “Queen of Knives” and “Shoggoth” to be entertaining but not memorable. Other stories were just bad, like “Goldfish Pool”, and “White Road”, and “Changes”.</p>
