        <p>First time listening to a book in Russian.</p>

<p>For some reason, found an <a href="https://akniga.org/dostoevskiy-fedor-bratya-karamazovy-stranicy-romana">abridged and dramatized</a> version, but by the time I realized this was the case, I was already well into it. No matter - the reader and dramatization was incredible, although I felt that the production suffered a bit from overly floral musical interludes. </p>

<p>This is a masterpiece of writing, vivid characters, and a terrifying portrayal of some of humanity's worst. Greed, so expertly portrayed by Dmitry Fedorovich and his father Fedor Pavlovich. Exquisitely neglectful parenting! The greed theme is so sickening of its own accord, but is compounded by one of the most disturbing father-son relationships. </p>

<p>The plot is complex, featuring a love pentagon, I think. Let me count the edges. Two brothers, their father, and two women. At least. </p>

<p>Золотые прииски. Сцена с Хохлаковой+++ Ну вообще, так образно описана Русская женщина!</p>

<p>Some of the most painful, vivid and florid expressions of love. So very Russian. Грушенька reminds me of A, and Митя reminds me of B, circa 15 years ago. Of course, they are far less extreme versions, but unrequited, violent, irrational, completely blind love is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>The mystery aspect of this book is intense, with the missed scene. Is there a patricide? Yes, but in a roundabout way. </p>

<p>Clearly things are missing in this abridged edition. Reading more into the story, I was disappointed to find whole characters missing, and reading more into it, I think that Ivan comes off somewhat flat, and could have been portrayed in more idealistic detail. </p>

    <title>Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>One of the better written Neal Stephenson books I’ve read so far. I found the first half especially engaging. Extremely varied, this book covers a lot of ground. </p>

<ul>
<li>History: Cromwell and the English Civil War, the Third Anglo-Dutch war. </li>
<li>Famous scientists and the Royal Society: Newton, Boyle, Hooke, Leibniz, <em>Waterhouse</em>. </li>
<li>Sailing and pirates: Edward Teach (Blackbeard) and <em>Otto van Hoek, captain of The Minerva</em></li>
<li>Pandemics and end-times: 1666 as the year of the beast, as well as continuing waves of the Black Death in London.</li>
<li>Money: bullion to paper &amp; centralized banking, and back.</li>
<li>Jews: a lens crafter makes a cameo in a casually anti-semitic context. Spinoza is mentioned. Wilkins’ treatise on tolerance.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this to be an excellent example of fiction doing what non-fiction can only dream of: in this case, imbuing dry history with a soul. Stephenson masterfully guides his reader through the gradual evolution of bullion and coinage to bills, and the regression that follows the Dutch war. A far more entertaining vignette of something dryly described in Debt.</p>

<p>Waterhouse aboard the Minerva feels like a more fun version of Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe I was especially into it since I’m sailing so much this year. Nice to see Stevenson using some antiquated sailing terms too. I learned that <em>larboard</em> is an antiquated term for port.</p>

<p>Part of the fun of reading Quicksilver is that, unless you cheat or happen to know many personalities from the 17th century, it’s hard to know whether a character is real or fictional. Daniel Waterhouse was so vivid by the end of it, I wasn’t sure about his status until checking.</p>

<p>The book feels a bit unfinished. For example, what happened to Enoch Root? Some passages are a bit rough, like the repetitive dialog with the Jew, who is continually called “The Ashkenazi”, “The Forelocked One”, “The Circumsized One”, etc. The last half felt a bit rushed, and the battle which Waterhouse solves with Trigonometry was a bit of a stretch!</p>

    <title>ESUP Builders</title>

        <p>Since May, I’ve been tinkering with brushless electrical motors, trying to make floating objects move more quickly. The proximate result is this electric motorized paddleboard:</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9BbHWMzhPdxekJZf7"><img src="/esup-builders/esup.gif" alt="Riding my DIY eSUP" /></a></p>

<p>This project is by no means finished. Traveling at 5 mph is fun, but not nearly fast enough. As we speak, a motor ten times the power of this one is sitting in a shipping container, en route to my basement. While I wait, let me pause and reflect on the project so far.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This summer I’ve been spending more time on the water. Sailing and stand-up paddling are great escapes from a sometimes monotonous routine. As a result, I’m slowly forgetting luxuries I once took for granted: work trips, visits to Vancouver, vacations to faraway lands.</p>

<p>After my forced sailing hiatus, I needed to find another way to get out on the water. SUPing was great fun, but a bit repetitive, and frustrating in even light headwind. Driven by the need for speed, I found <a href="http://efoil.builders/">efoil.builders</a>. They are a community of crazy European kids building electric hydrofoils that scream above the surface of the water at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to strange electric vehicles, but I certainly was when it came to high voltage and high current. When my Solowheel broke down last year and I was unable to fix it on my own, I donated it to an acquaintance who promptly replaced the battery and brought it into tip-top shape. It took him no time at all, but I had no idea where to begin.</p>

<p>Happily, the last few months have presented many opportunities for electrical work around the house. I installed a ceiling fan in our bedroom and a window AC in my daughter’s. I wired up and installed new outlets in the basement. These are not glamorous achievements, just small victories that slightly reduced my fear of electricity.</p>

<h1>Building for …</h1>

<p>There is something very satisfying about creating physical objects with your own hands. In these strange times, I find this to be one of my most comforting escapes.</p>

<p>If the resulting object is of value to you or others, so much the better. <a href="/toddler-music-box">Building for my daughter</a> takes the cake, especially when she appreciates the results. <a href="/little-free-library">Building for the community</a> is also gratifying and surprising. Sometimes you just build to learn. This time, I’m building for myself. And in this case, a big part of the challenge will be learning to ride the damn thing. I think I’m up for the challenge!</p>

<p>Realizing that I’m dealing with a completely new domain, and my chance of failure is high, I decided to start small. The first milestone was to create some sort of vessel from a plastic IKEA bin (max 30A, 11V, 5000 RPM, 3cm prop). Having proved the concept, I moved on to something that would support my weight, and substantially larger components (60A, 22V, 1000 RPM, 15cm prop).</p>

<p>Let me conclude with a parts list for both builds.</p>

<h1>Tropfast components</h1>

<p>As you can see, this is not a seaworthy vessel.</p>

<h1>Shared components</h1>

<p>As you can see, both vessels have a lot of component types in common. So much so that I simply reused some of the same parts in both projects:</p>

<ul>

<li>Charger: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QRQT3LC">Haisito 80W 6A Balance Charger</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I plan to write up a technical summary of what I learned in the process. Stay tuned.</p>

        <p>Somehow I am just now reading Cormac McCarthy for the first time. Thanks for the recommendation, M!</p>

<p>Incredible descriptions. Long beautifully flowing sentences and great vocabulary. I find myself looking up new words every few pages, and it feels nice to be reading literature again. The style is interesting too, with uniquely applied passive dialogs that I found very distinct.</p>

<p>Perhaps reading this serious dystopia at a particularly dystopian feeling time wasn’t the best call. Although short, it took me a while to finish, spacing my consumption apart, to avoid overdosing on doom and gloom.</p>

<p>The apocalyptic scenario was well done and mysterious. What happened to humanity to cause such a scenario? Half way, it’s unclear if that will actually be revealed or not. By the end of the book, somehow it doesn’t matter. The world sucks you in. It is what it is, and humanity persists.</p>

<p>Parts of this book reminded me of an interactive fiction, or a role playing game, especially the constant search for loot, rummaging through abandoned barns, copious amounts of useless, broken rakes.</p>

<p>And yet so dark, so biblical.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do you think that your fathers are watching? That they weigh you in their ledger books? Against what? There is no book and your fathers are dead in the ground</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the core of this book is the father son dynamic between the anonymous man and anonymous boy. It is deeply touching. Oh man, how incredibly sad that last scene is, even though you can see it coming for miles. I spent a good amount of time shedding tears, so surely this is a great work.</p>

    <title>Red Plenty by Francis Spufford</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Red Plenty is written as a series of vignettes that together do a remarkably good job of painting a picture of soviet life. It finds a comfortable spot between fiction and non-fiction. If someone ever asks me for a book on what life was like in the Soviet Union, I’d recommend this.</p>

<p>For me personally, it tied together a lot of personalities and events I was previously familiar with, having been raised in a Russian family. But many aspects crystallized in a more objective, less personal way. It was nice to feel certain stories and personalities fall into place, and fascinating to hear about some of the same events and people in English.</p>

<p>Spufford takes liberties for sure, often putting real people into semi-imagined situations. But this is done explicitly and honestly. He doesn’t quite tie everything together into a coherent arc. Instead, multiple sub-stories can be seen: Galich’s transformation from bon-vivant and darling of the state to a dissident, Khrushev’s rise from obscurity, and disillusioned retirement, a biologist’s battle with Lysenkoism, a mathematical economist’s attempt to reform central planning.</p>

<p>The author’s conception of the whole project of communism is that it itself is a sort of fable, heavily inspired by  Russian fables. Stories about the self-setting tablecloth (скатерть самобранка), flying carpets (ковер самоет), beyond the 39th land (тридевять земелья). He could have included any number of such fables, and to be fair, this is true of any techno-utopian perspective.</p>

<p>The format lends itself well to showing Russia from many lenses, letting the reader triangulate into the bigger picture. What is the role of connections in a world where money isn’t generally effective? Spufford shows how, to climb the ranks of an organization, one had to grovel and pander to communist ideologues despite deepest feelings. He shows cynicism, corruption, and violence that permeated life. He shows how stuck many people felt within it, especially women.</p>

<p>Despite my familiarity with the general outlines of many pieces of this book, I learned some completely new stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novocherkassk_massacre">Расстрел в новочеркасске</a> — First I’ve heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok">Akademgorodok</a> - I have an acquaintance from there, and have heard of it before, but this is way more detail than I’d ever known.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been listening to Галич lately…</p>

        <p>When my sailing class was canceled back in early March, I realized it was time for a more individualistic hobby. And so, I furled the sails and tied up the boat and picked up a circular saw from the hardware store. After I got over my fears of loud, terrifyingly quickly spinning metal blades, a whole bunch of cutting and screwing, then digging and painting, I have a Little Free Library standing outside my house, and a little bit more confidence for the next woodworking project!</p>

<p><img src="/little-free-library/little-free-library.jpg" alt="Little free library photo" /></p>

<!--more-->

<p>I drafted some <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d57c2f5444558be437e513c4/w/9e862248a8541fe7ce7a38a6/e/3efc51d554390f104d869fa6">initial plans in OnShape</a>, and deviated from them only slightly, the main difference being a much smaller front-right panel to make book access easier. As I became familiar with woodworking tools, I became a little bit less rigid and precise with measurements. </p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
<li>A very long plank of scrap wood found in my basement, 20mm deep was enough for structural materials.</li>
<li>30 or so brass screws</li>
<li>6 long screws</li>
<li>A fence post</li>
<li>Self-closing hinges and a button</li>
<li>Exterior-grade paint</li>
<li>A sheet of thin scrap plywood for shingles</li>
<li>Plexiglass sheet</li>
<li>Circular saw</li>
<li>Electric drill</li>
<li>Silicone mat</li>
<li>Caulk</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
<li>Shovel</li>
<li>Wood hand saw</li>
<li>Probably lots more</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mistakes and learnings:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don’t use brass screws, they are fragile. I broke two of them as I was screwing them. Instead, use steel. It’s cheaper and far stronger.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on glue for shingles. They warp, so use nails to hammer them on. I had to do this after it rained and they warped, despite a copious amount of glue.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on the guide of the circular saw. Instead, look at what the blade is actually doing at the cut point. I had a few rough cuts early on.</li>
<li>Use a protractor in order to measure 45 degree angles more accurately, which I found tricky to do through thick 4x4 fence posts (circular saw radius was too small, had to use a hand saw)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K3xP2XjPmUQ2bX1N7">more photos</a> that document the process. The results are passable but honestly, a little bit sloppy. Build quality aside, I’m thrilled to see actual use: the roster of books changing quickly. My initial dump of philosophy books was partially picked off, and then swiftly amended. I had predicted very little movement during the pandemic because of decreased foot traffic and increased paranoia about touching public things, but was sorely mistaken.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matthew for the pro-tips and help!</p>

    <title>Selected Short Stories of Philip K. Dick</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/selected-short-stories-of-philip-k-dick"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Almost every story in this collection elicits a “wow” and “yikes” gut reaction from me. Well written and original, many of these have been adapted into movies. </p>

<p>These stories do show some signs of aging: Cold War politics, Mechanical computers, Robots. But this makes them more authentic and gives them a distinct feeling. And while many things have changed, many others have not: Russia is still (again?) America’s adversary, Robots are still cool, and all of the tech nerds are obsessed with Mars. More fundamentally, Dick’s stories grapple with paranoia and mental instability, god, Dogs, the nature of reality, the evils of authoritarianism, and the banality of American consumerism.</p>

<p>These stories are dark, irreverent, funny, and sometimes profound. Highly recommended!</p>

<h2>Beyond Lies the Wub ★</h2>

<p>A large pacifist pig is mysteriously telepathic. It just wants to have philosophical discussions with you. But Captain Franco is hungry. He kills the Wub and eats it. His crew is disgusted by such despicable behaviour. But by the end of their dinner, Franco appears to be in a strangely philosophical frame of mind...</p>

<p>Is Franco a Wub now? Did the Wub become a pig from someone else? Is the Wub external to both?</p>

<h2>Roog</h2>

<p>A dog’s perspective. Boris the Guardian (dog) sees Roogs (garbage men) and guards his humans. Primitive but cute. </p>

<h2>Paycheck</h2>

<p>A mechanic is hired by a company doing advanced research. They pay well under the condition that they wipe his memories while he worked there. (Did this happen multiple times already?) Eventually, wanting to break the loop, the mechanic figures out a way to exact revenge.</p>

<p>PKD is obsessed with my name. The protagonist in this story has a Boris gun. (That said, this and the previous story are the only Borises featured in this collection).</p>

<h2>Second variety ★</h2>

<p>Following a nuclear winter started by the Russians, the Americans avoid complete defeat by retreating to the moon. As a resistance movement, The Americans develop robots built in autonomous underground factories. These robots self-improve and eventually become indistinguishable from humans, and exploit human emotion ruthlessly: type 1 is a small child clutching a teddy bear, Type 3 is a wounded soldier. </p>

<p>The story and world building is epic and extremely creepy. The story arc culminates when an American Major is left alone with 3 supposed Russians, one of which is a cylon of type 2. The crux is that it's not clear how many types there are in total, and this all plays out very dramatically, although I had some inkling of where things were going. Apparently the basis for “Screamers”.</p>

<h2>Imposter</h2>

<p>Another thriller of AIs and robots so convincing that even the robot itself can be a hundred percent convinced that it is in fact the person that it is emulating. Not a new idea even at Dick’s time but well executed.</p>

<h2>King of the Elves ★</h2>

<p>Cinematic and original take on insanity. The parallel worlds of gas station attendant and elf troll conflict is really compelling. It remains unclear which one is reality. I guess this is Dicks superpower: parallel un-realities. What is reality anyway?</p>

<h2>Adjustment Team ★</h2>

<p>Very stressful read. All of PKD seems to be like this: the protagonist discovers a crazy thing about reality, and is finds himself in an impossible situation where he is questioning his own sanity while trying to prove to someone that he is actually right. </p>

<p>An active God with a crazy plan to end the Cold War! I so love it when religion and science fiction meet. And comedy. I love the impeccable timing of annoying door to door vacuum and life insurance salesmen. </p>

<p>And another God-like dog. PKD is obsessed with dogs. I wonder if it's because dog is god backwards. I bet he had that thought more than once.</p>

<h2>Foster You’re Dead</h2>

<p>Ok. A little much for these COVID-19 times... All about a new American consumerism, stemming from over zealous cold warriors obsessed with survivalism. Mike's father is “anti-P”, a non survivalist without a backyard nuclear shelter. Eventually he caves in to the social pressure, but realizes he can't afford it. </p>

<p>Pretty good overall and timely in terms of survivalism being trendy. but slightly dated, in that consumer culture feels less pervasive. That said, I could see this coming back with something like <a href="https://medium.com/@RickByers/the-dawn-of-personal-biotech-cb0af0d52e4c">in-home PCR machines</a>.</p>

<h2>Upon the Dull Earth</h2>

<p>A uniquely creepy story featuring a young wife who finds an alien swarm of drones that call her siren song. Though her husband and family try to dissuade her, she succumbs to the force too soon by accident. In an attempt to bring her back, her husband makes a pact with the alien swarm, which turns her younger sister into her, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Masterfully crafted, this reads more like horror than science fiction. To the husband’s terror, each person he meets morbidly transforms into his beloved, first all of the members of her family, then their whole town and county, extending out to the whole world. The fear and terror of the despondent husband. Again, is this really happening, or is this an exploration into madness?</p>

<h2>Autofac</h2>

<p>In a post h-bomb destroyed world, humans subsist on essential goods that are forcibly delivered to their door. This automatic factory system was set in place as a contingency for when a nuclear war wipes out the world. But it's been a while and people are getting bored. The Autofac is programmed to keep delivering until people can self sustain, but there's one problem: the Autofac production pipeline is stripping earth bare.</p>

<p>Ultimately a super intelligence narrative, this story packs a punch, and is interesting in that it explores human-like competition in a super intelligent species.</p>

<h2>The Days of Perky Pat ★</h2>

<p>In a strange reversal, the surviving families of a nuclear war (called “flukies” because they survived due to luck) rely on their young children to get by. Meanwhile the parents spend all their time playing house with dolls. Perky Pat is a doll which is played by playing house in an elaborate game modelling the life that they used to have before the calamity. Their children, oblivious to the before the war, struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>A great concept and full of vitriol for consumerism, this story is a bit on the nose in its critique of consumerism, but definitely thought provoking. </p>

<h2>Precious Artifact ★</h2>

<p>During an existential battle between Terra and Proxima, a human terraforming engineer was sent to Mars to develop a colony there. For his years of labor, he was granted reunion with his family. But he wants to see what has come of earth. He insists on a trip, and is met there by a woman who shows him around. But he figures it out and forces Mary to reveal the truth. It quickly becomes clear that Terra lost the war, the woman is from Prox, and that everything he has been seeing is an illusion. His family is all dead, all human females too. All that survived are cats and dogs. </p>

<p>This story is all about layered deception. As a twist on an already tragic turn of events, it turns out that not even his newly gifted cat is real, merely a simulacrum. Everything is calculated by the Prox state, and there is a level of truth that is beyond anyone's grasp. </p>

<p>(As I sit here at home for days without seeing my parents and friends, I am starting to feel something unsettling creep in. What if all of these video calls are fake? This is another PKD story in the making.)</p>

<h2>A Game of Unchance</h2>

<p>Another Martian colony theme but wildly different from the others. A space-carnival arrives on Mars and the bored colonists end up losing a fortune in the carnival. Anticipating a return, they train up a psi wielding child to trick the carnival games and win big. This pans out but the spoils are tiny autonomous robots that the colonists accidentally activate, leading to mayhem. Interplan come and shut the village down. After a time the carnival returns. This time the winnings are a way to destroy the previous gift. It's as if the carnies had planned this all along. </p>

<h2>We can remember it for you wholesale</h2>

<p>A family man has an unfulfillable dream, an idea fix: to go to Mars. But he has no time and too many obligations. Luckily, there is a way out: he can hire a company to implant false memories about how he'd gone to Mars already, surely that will satisfy him? The company decides to implant the idea that he was a secret agent and sent to mars to kill a rebellion leader. As the man is placed under sedation to begin the memory grafting procedure, but then his real memories return to him: indeed he'd been to mars already as a secret agent and murdered a rebellion leader as instructed by his handlers. </p>

<p>As he realizes this, more and more memories return. Things get a bit silly, as every false memory that is about to be implanted turns out to be actually true. A clever reversal of the usual pattern of false memories which feel true but are false. </p>

<h2>Faith of our Fathers ★</h2>

<p>Great combination of religion, communism and science fiction. Set in an alternative future where China wins the Cold War, a young ambitious but cynical cadre is rising through the ranks of the CCP. A series of events lead him to take some drugs, and during a boring mandatory speech from the Great Leader, he sees a hallucination of the leader as a terrifying machine. But it turns out the drugs are actually sedatives that suppress his usually hallucinating state. It’s in the air and the water.</p>

<p>His boss presents him with a purity test comparing two essays. A new friend wants to understand more about the great leader and tells him how to tell the correct essay from the false one. (Incidentally they both feature good poems: one from 1001 tales, another a Song for St. Cecilias Day). As he gets promoted through the ranks, he is invited to a dinner party hosted by the great leader. Clandestinely, he takes that same anti-hallucinatory drug and sees the leader for who he truly is: God. He is both good and evil, and he doesn't give a fuck, mortally wounding the protagonist.</p>

<p>Cinematically, the cadre returns to his apartment feeling nihilistic, and, divulging news about the leader to his new girlfriend, dies from his injuries while loving her for the first time. </p>

<p>Powerfully written but somewhat incoherent. I bet PKD was super high writing this one. </p>

<h2>The Electric Ant</h2>

<p>A man has a workplace injury and loses his hand. The surgeon informs him that the hospital can do nothing to graft his hand back on, because he is a robot. Dick’s description of robotic technology is really quaint, involving lots of tape and visible circuits and whirring motors and such. </p>

<p>Anyway it's not so much about the fact that the man is a robot, but that he realizes that he can self-tinker and change his own perception by reprogramming various internal tapes and circuits. By punching a few extra holes in his tape he can see a park bench appear in his room, or a flock of ducks. Eventually he commits suicide by snipping his tape in a failed experiment. And as it turns out, in a somewhat juvenile “then he woke up” twist, his own subjectivity was intimately tied to everyone else's. A bit of a solipsistic mind-fuck, this one. </p>

<h2>A Little Something for Us Tempunauts</h2>

<p>One of the weaker stories in the collection, and thoroughly confusing because it's time travel related (never goes well). Set in an era of pioneer time travellers in the US, very much analogous to the Moon craze. A group of three time travellers suffer a fatal accident as they advance insufficiently far into the future and die. As they travel forward in time, they stop to see what their funeral processions are like.</p>

<p>The story takes a bizarre turn when it turns out that they want to be perpetually stuck in a time loop to relive their glory forever. And somehow they bring the rest of earth into this time loop with them. Shrug?</p>

<h2>The Exit Door Leads In</h2>

<p>In an Idiocracy-like future, a promising young Mr. Bibleman is noticed by the system, and wins a golden ticket to enrol in a military college. The sergeant administrator gives an introductory speech, indicating that students are not to be exposed to classified information. Bibleman is forced into a major focusing on pre-Socratic philosophy, which bores him. But on his very first day, he stumbles upon schematics for secret classified Panther Drive, which turns out to be general purpose technology for generating cheap energy. If released to the general public, such technology would be a boon to many suffering people. Should he leak it? What would the consequences be?</p>

<p>He is quickly caught by the sergeant, and forced to make a decision on an accelerated timeframe. Under pressure, he returns the printout out of a sense of loyalty, although it’s a tough decision for him. Disappointed, the sergeant boots him from the college. He should have made an independent judgement and leaked the memo instead. The whole College was a setup intended to filter out independent thinkers from conformists.</p>

<p>PKD makes a provocative claim: society self destructed because of complacency and rule following. Fuck loyalty and think for yourself. Surprisingly non-subtle and didactic, but an effective way to deliver the message.</p>

<h2>Rutavaara’s Case</h2>

<p>After resuscitating Rutavaara, one of the three person crew who died in an astronautics accident, the Proxians watch her mind’s eye replay her last living moments. But this time, Jesus Christ is also apparent. It's funny already, just because of the irreverent way in which Philip K. Dick uses Christ. In a bizarre twist, the Proxians decide to take advantage of the opportunity and introduce their own version of Christ into Rutavaara’s dream. Christ died for our sins, but the Proxian Christ (a sort of anti-Christ) kills for your sins, and so it was in Rutavaara’s terrifying mind. Instead of taking communion, you get eaten.</p>

<p>Interestingly written as a sort of apology from the Proxian perspective. The narrator appears to apologize to their deity. He concludes that the earthlings are thoroughly wrong about their umwelt. Meanwhile PKD is sitting and observing both bizarre theologies, and laughing.</p>

    <title>Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I liked this book, a succinct refutal of a bunch of tropes associated with innovation, littered with nice analogies and good quotes, and mercifully short.</p>

<p>At any point, innovation can only occur at the edge of possibility, at the <strong>adjacent possible</strong>. If you’re not bold enough, it’s already been done. Too bold and you’re ahead of your time. This model nicely explains why important discoveries are often arrived at simultaneously by multiple discovers in different places (called <strong>multiples</strong>).</p>

<p>Johnson describes environments conducive to innovation as <strong>liquid networks</strong>. In a gas, atoms are far apart and chaotic. They may collide, but they won’t stick. In a solid, atoms are too constrained and won’t have a chance to interact at all. A prehistoric human society is like a gas: ideas may form but the lifestyle is too chaotic for anything to stick. Religious autocracies of the European Dark Ages and post-Enlightenment Arab world are like a solid: society is too restrictive to even let ideas form in the first place.</p>

<p>In general, Johnson rejects the narrative of the Eureka moment, attributing success to <strong>slow hunches</strong>, which take a long time to brew in a person’s mind. In a liquid network, multiple slow hunches have a good chance of meeting, and an insightful person can combine the two into a coherent idea.</p>

<p>The author compares the web to cities and coral reefs, both as examples of productive, dense, liquid networks where entities flow freely. Citing <a href="/books/scale-by-geoffrey-west/">Scale by Geoff West</a>, he notes that big cities aren’t just proportionally more inventive than small ones, but super-linearly so, with higher per-capita output. Just like cities allow free mingling of people and their ideas, the web enables this for the whole world serving like a “dating service for promising hunches”, increasing <strong>serendipity</strong>.</p>

<p>The way to nurture a slow hunch is to take copious amounts of notes, as evidenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">Commonplace books</a> (new to me), which became popular during the European Renaissance, popularized by Locke. Charles Darwin’s commonplace book is mentioned quite a bit as an example.</p>

<p>The “missed connection” example he provides in a non-liquid network are two hunches that could have met to stop the 9/11 aircraft hijackings, but never did due to the solid-like FBI bureaucracy.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Memo">Phoenix Memo</a> advising about bin Laden’s coordinated effort to send students to US aviation schools.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacarias_Moussaoui">Moussaoui’s</a> arrest at a flight training school in Minnesota.</li>
</ol>

<p>Continuing the analogy of liquid networks and water, Johnson lauds <strong>desirable spillover</strong> from one group of humans to another, encouraging cross-pollination of ideas, and a multidisciplinary approach. Examples of this include Building 20 at MIT, the “womb of the institute”, a temporary building that was at the heart of hacker culture, discoveries like LIGO, and great companies like Bose. By having a place that breeds so much intellectual diversity, you can imagine ideas crossing boundaries. When one idea goes from one domain to another, it’s called <strong>exaptation</strong>. For example, Gutenberg’s printing press borrowed the screw press mechanism, which was used for pressing olives into oil and grapes into wine.</p>

<p>Naturally, as ideas form and evolve, many leads go nowhere. Edison said “I didn't fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” At this point, this is definitely a cliche.</p>

<p>The book concludes with a series of 2x2 tables showing four kinds of inventions (borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks">Wealth of Networks</a>):</p>

<pre><code>+------------+------------+---------+
|            | Individual | Network |
+------------+------------+---------+
| Market     | 1          | 2       |
+------------+------------+---------+
| Non-market | 3          | 4       |
+------------+------------+---------+
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Market / individual: solo entrepreneur or private corporation.</li>
<li>Market / network: marketplace with multiple individuals.</li>
<li>Non-market / individual: hobby or amateur scientist, sharing ideas freely.</li>
<li>Non-market / network: open source or academic env where ideas can be built on freely.</li>
</ol>

<p>Quadrant 1 occupies the popular imagination: instigated by solo inventor driven by profit like Edison, or in this case he picks on Carrier, inventor of the modern air conditioner. But in an analysis of inventions from 15th century until the present, Johnson concludes that most inventions fall into quadrant 4, the non-market network. </p>

<p>The author doesn’t do a convincing job of explaining why each invention falls into each quadrant, and in many cases I think the call is very subjective, but the framework is interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>Johnson ends in an interesting take on Darwin’s work. Darwin’s big idea is often popularized as <strong>survival of the fittest</strong>, but Darwin himself makes clear that the right environment is perhaps even more important. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef#Darwin's_paradox">In The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</a>, published in 1842, Darwin described how coral reefs were found in some tropical areas but not others, with no obvious cause. Tropical waters contain few nutrients yet a coral reef can flourish like an "oasis in the desert”, supporting over one-quarter of all marine species. His seminal work concludes with this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/lost-enlightenment-by-frederick-starr"/>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I first learned of this book after a quick conversation with Mark, whom I’ve only met once in-person. I was just finishing Debt, and found the book intriguing, especially the parts about the monetary systems in Islamic societies. Mark suggested this book, and indeed it covers a period of history that I know basically nothing about. With my interest piqued already, I decided to take the plunge.</p>

<p>This book was both broad and deep, covering an era from about 750 (a nominal end of the Arab conquest) through 1150 (roughly the time when intellectual fruits of the enlightenment were starting to wilt). It is well written, so in the moment you think you understand what’s happening, but afterwards it turns out that everything is really complicated.</p>

<p>My overall feeling after reading this book is that it serves well as a comprehensive introduction to the topic. But the topic is quite complex, and as a complete noob, I found myself struggling a little bit. As I write this summary, I constantly have to consult Wikipedia to understand the region and its civilizational chronology. Keeping track of the giant cast of ancient Arab, Turkish, and Mongol characters that the author presents is also a challenge. On the other hand, the introduction really hooked me and the first half of the book flowed very well. I did come close to abandoning the book about 3/4 through, especially since the Turkish empires just before the Mongol invasion seemed to be somewhat dull from both action and cultural perspectives. But it picks up again with Genghis Khan and Timur and their respective empires, and then the conclusion does a great job of tying it all together. I listened to the last chapter twice!</p>

<p>I don't know why, but these Soviet stamps of great Islamic scientists are really
appealing:</p>

<p><img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/al-kwarizmi.png"/>
<img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/al-biruni.png"/>
<img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/ibn-sina.png"/></p>

<h1>Where: cities and regions</h1>

<p>I left myself a TODO as I was summarizing: “understand all of the cities/regions? mentioned in this book, put them on a map. Who would have been living there at the time? And maybe one day visit them.” So far, I only have <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r3caNCqtH91TXpF2rug03XzKByZ1BkdL&amp;usp=sharing">a Google map</a>, but it’s a start! The trip may have to wait for global pandemics and regional instabilities to wane.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, it was never clear which name corresponded to a city, and which to a region. Trying to resolve this online isn’t that simple. One is confounded by inconsistent Latinization. Khwarazm has been known also as Chorasmia, Khaurism, Khwarezm, Khwarezmia, Khwarizm, Khwarazm, Khorezm, Khoresm, Khorasam, Kharazm, Harezm, Horezm, and Chorezm. </p>

<p>Here’s a crazy tidbit: by 1200, Merv (aka Marv, Merw, Mary, …) was the largest city in the world with possibly half a million souls. Thousands were employed just to maintain its irrigation systems. Yet I hadn’t even heard of the place. Much of central Asian architecture of the time was lost because buildings were not built out of stone but of more perishable materials. But the cities were huge and glorious for their time, according to eyewitnesses. </p>

<p>Later into the book, there were some familiar places mentioned which helped me anchor a bit. My dad’s business trips to Taskhent, Almaty in the heart of the region where some of my friends were born, as well as song references: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmfjt0DnfCs">Tian Shan mountains, lake Issik Kul</a>. I love it when I have multiple angles on the same concept. It feels like things snap into place!</p>

<h1>Why did the Islamic golden age happen?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Hardship and need for water meant complex irrigation systems required advances in science and technology.</li>
<li>Subsequent general prosperity (great harvests) meant intellectuals could devote time to science and art. </li>
<li>Social norms from pre-Islam: rulers needed to patronize the arts to show their greatness. </li>
<li>Religious pluralism: Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Zoroastrianism were common and coexisted. As Islamic scholars documented each prior culture, they adopted pieces of it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why did the golden age end?</h1>

<p>The author does a good job dismantling Sonia Brenkes’ argument that there was no decline, and that westerners are just culturally insensitive. I liked that. Starr illustrates a clear decline both quantitatively and qualitatively. He puts a lot of the blame on Sunni-Shia conflicts and restrictions in freedoms of expression. Universities languished while madrasas thrived. Printing took a very long time to be adopted. </p>

<p>The Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavids, Empires that followed Timur and the period covered in the book, were rich and powerful, but focused on aesthetics, art, and architecture over science. Many great books crumbled from neglect over this period. Europeans were the ones who launched efforts to preserve the ailing manuscripts. </p>

<p>The decline happened sometime around 1100. Starr enumerates many potential reasons for the decline, and rejects each in turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Climate change: the region’s climate hasn't changed much then to now. The efforts of the oasis irrigators were thwarted when the mongols came to power, but this was after the decline. </li>
<li>Innate tendencies of Mongols: mongols came well after the start of the decline so cannot be the cause. </li>
<li>Vasco de Gamma, because his sea route opened trade which impoverished the land routes: unlikely, since the sea route was encouraged by high tariffs and bandits along the land routes. Also intellectual decay came before economic decay. Great Caravanserai were built in 11 and 12th centuries.</li>
<li>Decline in patronage from rich nobles and split up of large empires into emirates: the same laws were in place during cultural vitality, same ability to donate to foundations. But at the point of decline, money went to madrasas and not individual creators. </li>
<li>The Turks sucked, but the Persians were awesome: There were definitely greats among the Turks though. </li>
<li>A decline of large empires: Timur’s was the last, but again this splintering happened well after the start of the decline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately the author decides the main reason for decline is a rift between Sunni and Shiite sects that led to a surge in intolerance. Rational thought and science was caught on the crossfire between the two. Great thinkers like Al-Ghazali gave firepower for restrictive legalistic interpretation of Sharia which led to tighter links between religion and statecraft. Also the rise of Sufism turned society to metaphysics and away from science.</p>

<h1>Great people and their ideas</h1>

<p>I didn’t get a great sense for the full impact of the intellectual output of Central Asia during this golden age. It still seems to me like the largest contributions were preserving Greek works, and popularizing Indian mathematics.</p>

<p>Great thinkers found themselves between three fundamental camps intuition, reason, and revelation. At first, reason reigned, math (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>) science (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a>) and medicine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna">Ibn Sina</a>) flourished, free thinkers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi">Al-Razi</a>) were given a platform, and strange Islamic-rationalist hybrids went to great extremes. Later, the mood changed and revelation became the last word (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali">Al-Ghazali</a>).</p>

<h2>Al-Kwarazmi’s mathematics</h2>

<p>Al-Khwarizmi (780 - 850) was a popularizer of mathematics and integrated the Indian invented decimal notation system into his works. He wrote practical books for tradesmen to apply mathematics to their craft, formalizing some algebraic manipulations. He and many others exemplified the sort of mathematical, physical, medical intellectual activity of the time.</p>

<h2>Extremely rational Islam!?</h2>

<p>For a time, reason was so revered in the Islamic world, that rationalist schools of Islamic theology emerged. The adherents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila">Muʿtazili</a> school are best known for rejecting the widely accepted doctrine of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, deducing that if the Quran is the word of God, he logically "must have preceded his own speech".</p>

<p>The movement reached its political height in 833 under Caliph al-Ma'mun, when Sunni and Shia scholars were punished, imprisoned, or even killed unless they conformed to Muʿtazila doctrine. The policy lasted for fifteen years, continuing through the reigns of al-Ma'mun's immediate successors.</p>

<h2>Ibn-Sina and Al-Biruni debate</h2>

<p>Ibn Sina (980 – 1037) and Al-Biruni (973 - 1050) were contemporaries and had a public debate which took place over many years and can be traced in their preserved letters. This feels very modern, western renaissance-y, and they dug deep into fundamental questions. If heat rises, how does the sun’s heat reach the earth? Was Aristotle right that planets have neither weight nor mass?</p>

<p>Biruni focused on physics and mathematics and reason. He was an empiricist at heart, and very practical. Biruni definitely has the author’s sympathies (and mine, of course), and seems like the winner on almost all counts. He seems ridiculously advanced in many ways, often having really good hunches for science that would be discovered 500 years later. Biruni suggested that maybe orbits could be elliptical, which was shocking given previous assumptions that movement can only be linear or circular. He somehow knew and wrote about fossils, which is very surprising given a recently <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/art-science-deep-time-conceiving-inconceivable-in-19th/id1246993791?i=1000464847732">Long Now talk</a>, which dates the first European fossil discoveries to the 19th century.</p>

<p>In many cases in the debate, Ibn Sina was right, like suggesting that light does not emanate from the eyes, as was the platonic ideal, but instead comes from the world. </p>

<h2>Al-Ghazali’s anti-rationalism</h2>

<p>Al-Ghazali (1058 - 1111) was a philosopher and theologian that studied with rationalists but adopted an anti-rationalist stance and sided with islamic mystics. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the sultanate became more extreme and intolerant, and Al-Ghazali gave them the theory on which to justify their politics, confidently suggesting that philosophers were apostates, and that even after a conversion to Islam, the subject may be a closeted unbeliever. Thus if a philosopher fell out of favor with authorities he could be labeled an apostate and effectively lynched.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali’s patron was killed, forcing him to change directions towards Sufism, a rising branch of Islamic mysticism. He justified his new path as the best possible life for all people with his characteristic zeal. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers">The Incoherence of the Philosophers</a>, Al-Ghazali solved many problems at once, explaining his popularity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Devastating weapons to use against philosophers.</li>
<li>Justified moving Sufism into central Muslim life.</li>
<li>Shifted political and intellectual atmosphere from philosophizing from first principles to sharia law.</li>
</ol>

<p>Al-Ghazali influences many theologians and philosophers, from Acquinas to Hume to Maimonides. </p>

<p>A wise modern science administrator once quipped, “an active scientist is always right, and the younger he is, the more right he is”. In contrast, Al-Ghazali wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important truths are already fully accessible in the Quran and Hadiths and are embodied in the Sharia. Faith, not science and rigorous thought, is the key to unlocking them. It it is most likely to appear among the elders (Aksakals) or Sufi masters whose lifelong pursuit of wisdom gives them the right and duty to teach the young. Let them impart wisdom, and let the young listen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Omar Khayyam</h2>

<p>Omar Khayyam was a great scientist and mathematician from Nishapur, active during the Seljuk era. It was only in his old age and exile from Merv, he turned to wine and poetry for which he is most known today. He watched in horror Al-Ghazali rose to prominence.</p>

<h1>Chronology</h1>

<p>Most of what follows is chronological-ish summary of what happened in the region before, during, and after the Islamic enlightenment.</p>

<h2>Before the Arab conquest (pre-622)</h2>

<p>This was the time of the first mounted horses, the first saddles in the first stirrups. This gave the Central Asians huge advantage over chariots. In addition it made them more mobile and nomadic. However these were not the stereotypical nomads that conflicted with city dwellers. These peoples needed goods that would come from cities, and the author paints a rather convivial picture of the two groups of people living in relative harmony. Central Asian cities were large and flexible in relation to Mediterranean cities which were quite fragile and small.
￼￼￼￼￼
Due to the harsh conditions of the region, engineers really needed to build solid irrigation systems. And the public understood this, and so technocrats were elevated in status. A lot of technical domains involved passing knowledge down from generation to generation, as a result of these professions were often practiced by groups of ethnically homogeneous people. For example glassblowing was predominantly Jewish practice. The pre-Islamic Central Asians were super literate. Sadly, little is left of that era because the Arabs burned a lot of their books in their invasion. ￼￼￼</p>

<p>The arid conditions were such that cities had to be built around oases which were pretty far spaced from one another. This meant that you couldn't really have large empires, as in Egypt for example all along the Nile.</p>

<p>Zoroastrianism was dominant in the area and had a huge impact on major world religions. I know nothing about it other than that “Thus Spake Zarathustra” song. Apparently Zoroaster invented the idea of heaven, hell, and redemption.</p>

<p>By 800, Roman roads were no longer needed and fell into disrepair. Instead, camels were very actively used for transport of goods but they couldn't carry as much weight as wheeled carts so trade skewed towards materials that were especially valuable and not particularly heavily. This is the “silk road”, although silk was just one of many goods, including lapis lazuli, emeralds, gold and other precious metals, ferried across this route. Dromedary or single humped camel's were phased out in favor of Bactrian (two hump) camels who are more hardy.</p>

<h3>Fate of old books</h3>

<p>Interesting trend of book burning by conquering civilizations. A Chinese dynasty referred to in Debt also burned all records kept before them. And the conquering Muslims burned huge swaths of history, impeding historians even today. But not all book destruction was so sudden, a lot of Islamic enlightenment books were simply allowed to decompose through neglect.</p>

<h2>Arab conquest (622-661)</h2>

<p>First the conquest in Central Asia proceeded slowly. Over centuries it rolled out, also stunted by internal conflict within the Islamic faith, the schism between followers of Mohameds direct line and the Ussayids.  Echoes of which continue to this day with the Sunni Shia rift. </p>

<h3>Islamic schism cheat sheet</h3>

<p>After Muhammad’s death, a schism emerged in Islam: who can lead the Muslim world? Two main factions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any Muslim can lead (Umayyad Caliphate, 661 - 750). Now known as Sunni (HQ: Saudi Arabia)</li>
<li>Only blood descendants of Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law and appointed heir, can lead (Abbasid Caliphate, 750 - 1258). Now known as Shia (HQ: Iran)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Umayyads (661 - 750)</h2>

<p>A particularly vicious conqueror <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutayba_ibn_Muslim">Qutayba ibn Muslim</a> (Umayyad) set out to finally quell central Asian forces. He was uncharacteristically brutal, likely out of a lack of self confidence. He was responsible for burning whole libraries of Zoroastrian works at Buchara, and killing and enslaving thousands brutally. Seeking certainty, Qutayba asked his forces to swear fealty to him, and was met with silence, only to be murdered days later. </p>

<p>Following Qutayba came a more moderate governor and general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasr_ibn_Sayyar">Nasr ibn Sayyar</a> who undid some of the more draconian policies, but only after a series of terrible mistakes which alienated the indigenous population, by first levying a tax on non Muslims, then having a mass conversion which undid the tax base, and then a law which forced men to prove their faith by undergoing circumcision.</p>

<h2>Abbasids (750 - 1258)</h2>

<p>Ultimately a general named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Muslim">Abu Muslim</a> consolidated a lot of power in Central Asia, was quite heterogenous in his faith and grew a large coalition army consisting mostly of central Asians. Ultimately these forces obliterated the remaining Umayyads in Damascus and quelled the Chinese forces to the East. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mansur">Al-Mansur</a> was selected to rule the Abbasids, who were at this point concerned about Abu Muslim’s faith and loyalty. Mansur was a hard liner and didn't trust Abu Muslim, ultimately having him killed in hopes of stamping out any form of Shiism and quelling Central Asian influence. He dumped Abu Muslim’s body in the Tigris. This effectively martyred the man, who was extremely popular, and led to many more rebellions against the already unpopular Abbasid rulers. Many of these claimed to be in Abu Muslim’s blood line, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Muqanna">Al-Muqanna</a>, famously wearing a green face mask, inspiring stories by Borges and Moore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much the way Greek culture eventually conquered a triumphant Rome, Central Asian culture was now in position to conquer the Abbasids and their new capital, Baghdad. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Baghdad modeled after Merv (762)</h3>

<p>The most culturally important city of the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_city_of_Baghdad">Baghdad</a> was essentially a planned circular city, likely modelled after Merv’s administrative centre, with Merv-imported architects and craftsmen central in the planning and construction. It was built my Al-Mansur, the same Abassids caliph that killed Abu Muslim. Parts of the city were named in honor of Merv too, including a street and a quarter. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>, Al-Mansur’s grandson eventually became caliph. His leadership coincided with a golden age in Baghdad, exemplified by the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>, the Grand Library of Baghdad. His rise to power was in part sponsored by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmakids">Barmakids</a>, a very rich family of central Asian heritage and with deep Buddhist roots. They were great sponsors of science, medicine, and philosophy. They are most famously known for having translated large numbers of classic Greek texts into Arabic.</p>

<p>Translations were selective. Only Greek texts, no Latin works were translated. Also no tragedies, history, or drama was translated, mostly focused on philosophy and medicine and science. </p>

<p>Baghdad has a glorious phase as described in 1001 nights, but descended into a regression that lasted several generations. Ultimately it's golden age was relatively short lived and the cultural and scientific centre shifted back to central Asian cities. </p>

<h3>Decline of Baghdad (808)</h3>

<p>Baghdad's golden age was short. The new caliph realized that Central Asia would need its autonomy and expanded the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan">Khorasan</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahir_ibn_Husayn">Tahir</a>, his appointed governor. Tahir promptly declared independence and Khorasan continued to be a client state, paying tribute to Baghdad but largely autonomous. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Khorasan comprised the present territories of northeastern Iran, parts of Afghanistan and much of Central Asia. The province was often subdivided into four quarters. Nishapur (present-day Iran), Marv (present-day Turkmenistan), Herat and Balkh (present-day Afghanistan) were the centers, respectively, of the westernmost, northernmost, southernmost, and easternmost quarters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tahir’s son took over after his deceased father and instituted broad minded educational reforms, insisting that even the poor farmers need to be educated. Simultaneously, there was some unrest among the patricians of the city. The rift was around a more or less literal interpretation of the Quran, but ultimately which of the two camps would wield power over the other. Ultimately the whole land owning class gently self destructed. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur">Nishapur</a> was the cultural capital in the 9th century, and on the backdrop described above, much philosophical activity ensured. From hardcore Islamist literalists to militant atheists, to Aristotelian rationalists that were still fervent Muslims. </p>

<p>A populist band of brothers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%27qub_ibn_al-Layth_al-Saffar">Ya'qub</a> and his younger led a rebellion against the Abbasid caliph, threatening Baghdad. Barely Islamic at all, this band restored even more autonomy to the central Asian area of Khorasan. Eventually defeated, he and his younger brother briefly formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffarid_dynasty">Saffarid dynasty</a>, autonomous large chunk of Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Samanid Empire (819 – 999)</h2>

<p>Samanid state was founded by four brothers; Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas. Each took control over a large city in the region. Ultimately one of them took over but did so bloodlessly, removing just brothers from power without killing them.</p>

<p>The Samanid allowed for a more diverse cultural base, keeping Arabic but also allowing indigenous languages: Persian, Turkic. This ultimately paved the way for more Turkish influence in the region.</p>

<h2>The Kara-Khanids (990 - 1040)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Khanid_Khanate">Kara-Khanids</a>, Turkish nomads began moving west. As the Samanid empire was declining, they made easy targets. They converted to Islam (from their native Tengrism) but weren't especially religious. Where they invaded Central Asia from the east and gained control over large chunks of it, they erected incredibly tall minarets known as victory towers, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyan_minaret">Kalyan minaret</a>. They were mostly militaristic and remained true to their steppe culture. </p>

<p>This is also a time of Turkish nationalism and a general popularization of the Turkic languages. Their capital was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasagun">Balasagun</a> (now destroyed), but the empire extended quite far west, into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand">Samarkand</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termez">Termez</a>.</p>

<h2>The Seljuk Empire (1037 – 1194)</h2>

<p>The Seljuks were a Turkish people that originated near the Aral Sea, but expanded westward, taking Khorasan, and eventually going as far west as to conquer most of Anatolia.</p>

<p>Sanjar, The last ruler of the Seljuks favored monumental architecture, which turned out to be quite influential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Ahmed_Sanjar">Sanjar’s tomb</a> inspired the Duomo in Florence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral">Isaakievskiy Sobor</a> in St. Petersburg, and the Capitol Building in Washington DC.</p>

<h2>Mongol Invasions (1219 - 1370)</h2>

<p>Genghis Khan had no initial plan to conquer Khwarezm. He sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor. Hoping to unify Turks and Mongols under one nomadic banner ("people in felt tents”), Genghis Khan successfully conquered other nomadic peoples with relatively little bloodshed. To establish trade ties, Genghis sent a 500-man caravan, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalchuq">governor of Otrar</a> had them arrested as spies and executed the entire party with the Shah’s support. </p>

<p>The mongols were swift and ruthless in their revenge. Genghis Khan besieged Otrar in 1219, which resisted for five months and then fell. In the ensuing war, lasting less than two years, the Khwarezmid Empire was destroyed. The Mongols ruled</p>

<h2>Timurid Empire (1370 - 1507)</h2>

<p>Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage, established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>By 1500, the Timurid empire was in decline due to infighting and pressure from Safavids and Ottomans. Babar, who claimed to be Genghis Khan’s descendant from father, and Timur’s descendant from mother, founded the Mughal empire which ruled over India. The three major Islamic empires split between them most of the Islamic world.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many open questions and lingering threads remain, as well as directions for further exploration.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’d never heard of the epic poem Shahnameh, but it seems to differ from its Greek predecessors by being more inward looking and existential in nature. Worth a looksee if there are good translations.</li>
<li>Read the Borges stories “The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv”, and “The Zahir”.</li>
<li>Read something by Omar Khayyam. Maybe “The Rubaiyat”?</li>
<li>The first poem in Lalla-Rookh (1817) by Thomas Moore is “The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan”.</li>
</ul>

    <title>Debt: The First 5000 Years</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>“Debt” has been on my reading list for a long time. I once attempted the hard copy, but abandoned it quickly. It was mentioned again on a podcast by Saul Griffith, just as I was starting to get interested in the role of financing advances in innovation and progress. So I decided to give it another shot. This is the second edition of the book, updated after the financial crisis and after the 99% protest movement, which the author helped organize.</p>

<p>My overall feeling is that I learned a lot. The author, Graeber, is an anthropologist, and clearly erudite in a lot of adjacent fields as well. On the flip side, especially toward the end, the author’s personal beliefs became too prominent, at times transforming informative book into angry screed. Understandably, this detracted from the credibility of the book.</p>

<h1>Moral confusion around debt</h1>

<p>Graeber starts many chapters of the book with awesome quotes. Here’s one: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you owe the bank one hundred thousand, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank one hundred million, you own the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Graeber describes how small-scale societies were based on mutual obligation, but as they grew and matured, debt became identified with money, became more transferrable from one person to another organization, to a yet larger one. Every step in that chain becomes less personal and more cruel. This may be the case, but it remains unclear to me that we can do better given the scale of our current societies.</p>

<p>Interestingly, many monetary systems are based on a small group of creditors giving out a large loan to the government that is then never repaid. This is true of Britain today, where the system nominally rests on a 1 million pound loan given by a few wealthy merchants many centuries ago. </p>

<h1>Myth of barter</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong. – H. L. Mencken</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the afterword, Graeber reflects on the book and suggests that this chapter was his strongest. I agree: it is least rambling, most concrete and informative.</p>

<p>Barter is often imagined as a prehistoric mode of exchange by economists, as a precursor to money. A point out that a society that employed barter would require a two sided marketplace for each transaction (eg. I want shoes but have pencils, so need to find a shoe vendor that wants pencils specifically). The way out is to create a multilateral deal, or invent a medium of exchange (money). </p>

<p>Except there are no known societies that employ barter internally. This is where Graeber’s anthropology background really comes in handily. Barter tends to be used between strangers, and typically as a single turn game, not a repeated one. </p>

<p>In fact, the system that predates bullion wasn’t barter, but one of lending and ledgers. This was the dominant system in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Coins came later and were relatively unimportant for a long time.</p>

<h1>Wizard of oz</h1>

<p>Apparently there is an economics reading of the Wizard of Oz: </p>

<p>The Wicked Witches of the East and West are the coastal banking elites. The scarecrow is the prototypical farmer that gets screwed over but doesn't have the brains to address the underlying issue. The tin man is the proletarian worker who doesn't have the heart to side with the farmer. The lion is the political elite that doesn't have the courage to step out of rank. And they all march to the White House. The Emerald City is full of greenbacks, and many other gems refer to the proposed silver standard. All of it is a parable for William Jennings Brian's attempt at presidency and the first marches on the White House.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">Turns out</a> this isn’t Graeber’s invention.</p>

<h1>Primordial debt</h1>

<p>Graeber explores the link between monetary debt and its predecessor, spiritual debt. Linguistically, the two concepts are deeply intertwined, most strikingly, German “gelt” and English “guilt” share a root (many other examples in book).</p>

<p>In a sense, you owe your existence to your parents, to society, and ultimately to God. But this is a debt you can never fully repay, although you must try anyway. Would you want to be square with your parents? If even possible, That implies you want nothing to do with them. Graeber’s take is that our relationship with cosmos is ultimately nothing like a commercial transaction. </p>

<p>Here, we tend towards a more philosophical exploration. I enjoyed it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are free from your debt to your ancestors when you become an ancestor; you are free from your debt to the sages when you become a sage, you are free from your debt to humanity when you act with humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Morality and economics</h1>

<p>Communism as defined by “for each according to their needs, from each according to ability” is often practiced in smaller units, most notably the family, but not successfully in large scale societies.</p>

<p>Giving gifts to low status folks is fraught. You risk putting them down because there’s no way for them to pay you back. Conversely, giving gifts to superiors is fraught too. What can you really give to a king? It often leads to an expectation of such gifts and ultimately a tradition of tribute. Even to peers, gift giving can often be competitive. A fancy meal is met with a fancier meal.</p>

<p>At the same time, being slightly indebted to peers is a great way to build social cohesion. It feels like in western society many don't often feel indebted to other individuals, only to institutions. </p>

<h1>History of honor</h1>

<p>I struggled a bit with this chapter. Graeber drives at this idea that commerce is inherently based on violence, and is deeply rooted in slavery. This is where Graeber’s personal opinions start muddying the waters and the going gets tough for the first time. But he recovers and there’s more meat to be had.</p>

<h1>Money vs debt</h1>

<p>Currency and more traditional debt and credit system arrangements came in and out of fashion over time. Money correlated to periods of war, because it was a time of mass mobilization, and having currency made it easier to pay soldiers. Credit systems flourished during periods of peace because they relied on trust networks to operate.</p>

<p>Many forms of currency existed before bullion (gold and silver). Cowrie shells were commonly used as money in China and other societies. Coins were first invented in Anatolia around 600 BCE by private citizens. Almost immediately they were adopted by the state. Same pattern repeats in other civilizations.</p>

<p>Coins and silver bars were mostly controlled by the rich, mostly stored in temples for religious purposes. But during times of conquest they were broken up and split up among warriors. Alexander the Great’s forces numbered 120,000 and had a daily wage of half a ton of silver! When he conquered, he coined new money from Assyrian reserves to pay his army. </p>

<p>In India, Ashoka began his rule by conquering a neighbor, one of the last independent Indian states. He won the war but at a huge cost of hundreds of thousands of deaths, and vowed never to fight again. Coinage began to dwindle and was replaced by system of credits. </p>

<p>Origins of interest are unknown but it was already happening by 2500 BCE in Mesopotamia! In the ancient world, a jubilee ritual of “breaking the tablets”, annulling all debts was done on a semi-regular basis. Jubilee was also demanded by peasant uprisings and granted by kings to mollify the people. </p>

<h1>Axial age</h1>

<p>(Interestingly, I am attempting to tackle a series of lectures on this topic. Haven’t made much progress yet, but this angle was specifically financial.)</p>

<p>Coined by Karl Jaspers, the Axial Age is a period around 800 BCE to 200 BCE marking a sudden beginning of reasoned inquiry. A wide range of positions in philosophy suddenly bloomed simultaneously in many places. Consider the lifespans of a few but diverse philosophers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pythagoras - 570-495 BC</li>
<li>Buddha - 563-483 BCE </li>
<li>Confucius - 551-479 BCE</li>
</ul>

<p>Graeber extends his timespan to 600 CE, also including the “spiritual age” when Jesus and Mohamed and the Rabbinical tradition came into being. These were times of war, and transactions needed to be anonymous. Luckily, cash enabled this, and radically simplified all of the complex dynamics of trust-based systems. This led to the cold, hard, rational calculations and a profusion of new concepts: profit and loss.</p>

<p>Interestingly, with the advent of both impersonal greed and philosophical thought, religious spheres emerged, promulgating the idea that giving is better than taking, common to all religions of the axial age including Buddhism, Christianity, Islam. This is when the concept of Charity first enters the picture.</p>

<h1>Middle Ages</h1>

<p>The Middle Ages have a bad rap, but this is in large part because of the way that they are often presented in stark opposition to the renaissance, oftentimes by people living in the renaissance. The terms themselves are illuminating: a dark age turned into an era of rebirth!</p>

<p>True, cities like London and Paris which blossomed during the renaissance, were just remote outposts of the Roman Empire. When the empire fell, these cities returned to their prior obscurity. And even in these frontier towns, records were continued to be kept in Roman currencies. Meanwhile Rome and Constantinople flourished. </p>

<p>Around the same time in India, Buddhism was flourishing and monasteries were funded by permanent trusts where the principal was lent out at a steep (15%) yearly interest rate. This was super surprising to me, since I’ve associated trusts like these with modernity.</p>

<p>In China, paper money emerged out of convenience in the 10th century. Rather than carrying strings of coins, which incidentally is why coins had a hole in the middle — to thread a string through for ease of carry, merchants traveling long distances preferred to carry less so developed a system of stamped paper notes. These were initially rejected by Chinese authorities, but being unable to control the practice adequately, they ultimately created a bureau to regulate the practice. A common pattern for China. </p>

<h2>The Arab world</h2>

<p>Graeber considers the Arab world at this time as basically western, an intellectual successor to the Greeks and Romans. Just like Middle Eastern Europe (then in shambles), the Arab world was attempting to synthesize the greek tradition with the prophets of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In stark contrast, the East was completely different. Super interesting 10,000 foot view.</p>

<p>Islam was super progressive for its time, addressing many of the injustices of the Axial Age. This included prohibitions against kidnapping into slavery, and also the hard stance against usury. But despite that, Islam had no issue with commerce in general, Mohamed himself at one point working as a merchant. Early Muslim states flourished economically and had banks that charged fees rather than compounding interest due to usury prohibitions. As a result, banking on its own wasn't a lucrative enough profession so many rich merchants doubled as banks for lesser brethren. Much of the economy was based on trust, and there was a real aversion to government interference in market mechanisms.</p>

<p>Apparently Adam Smith actually cites a lot of Persian economists. Smith’s pin factory is just a re-hashing of Al-Ghazali, who used the example of a needle factory to illustrate the same point. The pin doesn’t have a single maker, but twenty-five persons involved; these are all collaborating in the absence of a central planner. Adam Smith changed Al-Ghazali’s view that markets work because people like to co-operate to the view that market participants are only interested in selfish gain.  (Just how much of Smith was borrowed from Al-Ghazali and Al-Tusi is unclear from Graeber’s account, and he doesn’t make explicit claims here, but this is definitely one of those “this is why we can’t have nice things” with finger pointed at Americans.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Christendom, things were quite different. Markets came quite late and merchants as a profession were shunned by the church. All of Europe was a checkerboard of baronies and church holdings, with constant conflict reshaping the borders.</p>

<h1>The great capitalist empires</h1>

<p>After a long shift away from bullion, the age of exploration coincided with a reversion to money     Partly due to the influx of gold and silver from the new world. </p>

<p>During the enlightenment, an interesting trend: the dominance of bullion as a logical continuation of conservation laws coming from physics. “Newtonian economics” suggests that money cannot be created or destroyed, and that it needs an intrinsic anchor for its value. This wasn't really a consideration until the renaissance. </p>

<p>Locke himself advocated for this Gold Standard, which led to financial troubles. Hobbes meanwhile promulgated the natural selfishness of people and necessity for social contacts. </p>

<p>From this point onward, Graeber’s writing really becomes unbearable. His bias is too apparent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the secret scandal of capitalism that at no point was it organized primarily around free labor. The conquest of the Americas began with mass enslavement then gradually settled into debt peonage, African slavery and indentured service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does concede that the world is better today, but at a cost, making asinine comparisons between slavery and modern wage labor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no doubt that progress has produced an unprecedented improvement on the lives of billions over the last 250 years. But it's also unclear to me whether all of these improvements can be tied to capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The beginning of something to be determined…</h1>

<p>Nixon gets blamed for a lot of terrible things, including Vietnam. Is this fair, given that he inherited the war?</p>

<p>So many tropes! The US supposedly uses its military power to terrorize the world. US bonds are actually tribute, not loans. Many of his claims reek of edge-lordship, others come off sounding like conspiracy theories. China is apparently trying to turn the US into a client state. By giving tribute and lavish gifts to its clients, China has previously turned its nemeses into dependents. </p>

<p>Yeah, okay, maybe. I’m torn!</p>

    <title>Revenge of Analog</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <blockquote>
  <p>“Digital’s overwhelming superiority initially renders analog alternatives worthless, but over time the perception of value shifts and when the honeymoon with a particular technology ends we are more readily able to judge its true merits and shortcomings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very wordy, this is definitely a book to skim. The gist is that we’ve been overzealous about digitizing everything, and now analog is making a comeback in some areas. The book is a straightforward walkthrough of a few domains where this has been happening. The author does a good job of not sounding too crotchety, which is very easy to do in books like these. But this book has basically no insights. It’s more a summary of ideas that are all in the air.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The author presents a semi interesting study on Moleskine, colored by the character who helped cofound the company. There is indeed something that feels inherently good about taking paper notes. But not much insight beyond this. </p>

<p><strong>Board games</strong>: Turns out people are social! And the trend in video gaming is towards solo or online multiplayer, where you are fundamentally alone in a room. In contrast, with board games you're together with a bunch of friends and there's a lot more happening than just the game!</p>

<p><strong>Retail stores</strong> are still important. No surprises again, that Apple and other maintain store presence and support. And bookstores are a good example of tactile scanning and easy previews. Conspicuously absent are libraries. </p>

<p><strong>Work</strong>: As far as I can tell this is where the author complains about tech displacing blue collar jobs. Sadly, even vinyl pressers are going to be automated if the market grows. You'll need CNC experience not operators. </p>

<p><strong>Education</strong>: Attempts to reform education have all been made with advents in new technology. And so far the traditional school classroom approach seems to be giving best results. This is a good reminder for me to ensure that my daughter ends up in a tech-free classroom. I found this quote to be oddly satisfying, and felt sorry for Thrun</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thrun predicted that MOOCs would be so distributive that in 50 years only ten institutions in the world would provide higher education and his would be one of them. Apparently a lesson about Icarus’s journey to the sun wasn't included on the Udacity syllabus.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the idea that camp Walden doesn't allow any tech for its campers.</p>

<p>Overall, this book could easily be compressed into a 10 minute article. I found no new ideas in this book, just an occasional head nod: confirmation.</p>

        <p>As Newton wrote, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants”. But whose giant shoulders did Newton stand on? And did those giants stand on the shoulders of other giants? And how about Newton’s successors, or people working in other fields? As far as I can tell, it’s giants all the way down.</p>

<p>Last year, I got my hands on a remarkable book, <a href="/books/asimovs-chronology-of-science-and-discovery/">Asimov’s Chronology of Science and Discovery</a>. It inspired me to produce a visual summary of human ingenuity, to see what one giant saw from the shoulders of another. After some experimentation, I turned it into an interactive visualization. You can play with it <a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape#steel">here</a>:</p>

<p>One of the unnerving things about Isaac Asimov’s book was the visual table of contents for the first edition:</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/original-visualization.jpg" alt="Winding visualization of Asimov’s Chronology in the first edition." /></p>

<p>Following this winding path is tricky to say the least. With this in mind, I carefully read the first quarter of the book, spanning from the beginning of time until 1700 CE, which amounts to about 300 entries, or about a quarter of those contained in the book. I took notes in a spreadsheet, providing a 1-2 sentence summary of each entry and manually extracting some key metadata. For each of Asimov’s entries, I captured the title, a couple sentences of description, the associated person’s name, and where the invention was created or discovery found, usually the country or empire.</p>

<p>In addition, I provided two extra fields which are more subjective and frankly, made up by yours truly, to bring the visualization to life: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Field</strong>: which domain was this discovery made. (How granular should this be? Should Science be split up into Chemistry, Physics, and Biology?)</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: what older inventions and discoveries enabled this one. (This can be really tricky.)</li>
</ol>

<p>With this in place, Asimov’s linear chronology becomes a directed graph, and since we don’t know how to time travel, there are no time cycles. So what we have is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph (DAG)</a>. It is not a tree since I allow each node to have multiple parents. For instance, the field of Geometry is built up logically from axioms. At the same time, the founding text of the field, Euclid’s Elements, is mostly derived work from many mathematicians working before Euclid in the Academy and Lyceum. So the DAG shows <strong>Geometry</strong> rooted both in <strong>Advanced Schools</strong> and <strong>Logic</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape/#geometry"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-geometry.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Geometry." /></a></p>

<h2>Manual entry is tiring</h2>

<p>Sadly, the Chronology is not available as a text-based ebook, which complicates matters. As it turns out, optical character recognition (OCR) is not easy if your content is laid out like a newspaper:</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/book-flow-ocr.jpg" alt="Excerpt of the book showing tricky text flow" /></p>

<p>Google Cloud Vision and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a> don’t do well on complex text flows, often failing to recognize section boundaries. For the image above, tesseract wrongly assumes that that the text flows in three full height columns.</p>

<p>I also tried to do automatic entity extraction using python’s <code>nltk</code> and <code>ne_chunk</code> to automatically generate inventors and locations but a quick experiment yielded too many entities for each entry, meaning that I’d have to make a manual pass regardless, and this step would provide minimal time savings.</p>

<h2>Playing cards and tech trees</h2>

<p>Each invention and discovery needs its own view. I gravitated to a card metaphor, which is often used in historical strategy games like Civ, role playing games like Diablo, and in many playing card games like Magic the Gathering. Here are a <a href="https://www.are.na/boris-smus/tech-tree-cards">few examples</a> that inspired me.</p>

<p>One challenge that I found ultimately insurmountable was to find good images for each entry. While you can find reams of royalty free images, and even download them automatically using tools like <a href="https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download">googleimagesdownload</a>, finding a set that is visually consistent was tough. I did this manually for the first hundred inventions. Theoretically a style transfer model might be able to convert them all to a consistent look. But ultimately, they didn’t add much value to the visualization as a whole, so I ditched the idea.</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/card-images.jpg" alt="Attempt to use images in the cards" /></p>

<h2>Chronological visualization</h2>

<p>To visualize the entries, I started with a naive approach: render all of the entries at once in a giant horizontal scrolling view, kind of like how tech trees work in Civilization-like games. Doing such a thing linearly makes no sense at all, since the first entry in the book is Bipedalis, dating to 4 million years ago (ma), followed by Stone Tools at 2 ma, Fire at 0.5 ma, then 8 entries later, Agriculture at 0.01 ma (10,000 years ago). This sort of timeline is best represented on a log-scale, which makes entries more reasonably spaced out, although still not perfect. Actually there’s quite a lot of variation in density. For example, this is the chronology of the first millennium CE (1000 years):</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/chrono-first-millennium.jpg" alt="Chronology of first millennium" /></p>

<p>While this is just the 16th century (100 years, an order of magnitude shorter than above):</p>

<p><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/chrono-sixteenth-century.jpg" alt="Chronology of 16th century" /></p>

<p>Even with the log-scale, inventions are by no means well distributed in time, with the 16th century far more visually dense than the first millennium. In both examples, links are especially obscure, since they often stretch out for many screens, and are basically impossible to trace from source to destination. </p>

<p>I tried variants of this view as well, involving collapsing entries into more compact default representations, and allowing them to be expanded for more detail. One promising variant involved expanding a selected entry and all transitively linked ones, but the predecessors and successors are still typically positioned far off-screen, so a lot of scrolling is required.</p>

<h2>Entry-centric visualization</h2>

<p>One of the shortcomings of a purely chronological view is that connections between entries are lost. Yet this is the most important part of this whole project, so I kept searching.</p>

<p>I opted for a more structured approach, one that lets you focus on a particular entry and at a glance see what technology led to it, and what technology it enabled. At the same time, I wanted to show the invention in its chronological context, in the spirit of Asimov’s book. So the current design takes a Cartesian approach, with one card centered at the origin, serving as the focus. Technologies that enabled the focused card are shown to the left and technologies that the focus enabled are shown to the right, along the x axis. Chronologically previous and next entries are shown along the y axis. </p>

<h2>Technology transcending fields</h2>

<p>Once the dependency graph is in place and each entry is associated with a field, one starts seeing interesting patterns in the data. </p>

<p>The discovery of magnetism lead to the invention of the compass, giving navigators confidence to traverse the ocean, in turn leading to the discovery of the new world:</p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape#compass"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-compass.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Compass." /></a></p>

<p>Melting glass beads and glass blowing enabled lens crafting and microscopes which in turn let careful observers see microorganisms in pond water, ultimately leading to great advances in medicine. </p>

<p><a href="https://borismus.github.io/asimov/web/cross-shape#microscope"><img src="/visual-chronology-science-discovery/screenshot-microscope.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the visual chronology centered at Microscope." /></a></p>

<p>Cross field dependencies like the ones I described above are visualized as dashed red arrows.</p>

<h2>Please help complete this project</h2>

<p>This visualization is backed by a spreadsheet which is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDNXas7DzwglB95HV2_2u1utWAwBZR2hQHlMPz-fj5A/edit#gid=0">publicly viewable</a>, the result of a bunch of my own reading and summarizing. I’ve compiled a quarter of Asimov’s impressive tome by hand, but I’d love your help finishing the project.</p>

<p>If you’re game to help, here are the necessary pieces:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/190RDAxrUzu5m0d_zxQi98euIguBDb0qf/view?usp=sharing">PDF of the second edition of Asimov’s Chronology</a> I scanned in hopes of automating the whole process (see above).</li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDeBCfcaVUfZFEK-0WJIb43dT6cqHHq9o6Uxn6PihLY/edit#gid=158368026">publicly editable spreadsheet</a> containing stubs for all of the inventions listed in the chronology from 1700 to 1993.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please read a chunk of the latter quarter of the book (starting 1700) and contribute it to the public spreadsheet. I hope you will be as excited as I was to learn a whole lot about the history of science and compile it into this format. Once the project is complete, it will be glorious! </p>

<p>I’ll update this post as more of the spreadsheet is filled out. Meanwhile, thanks for reading and stay tuned – I have a few follow up posts in mind already.</p>

<p><strong>Update Feb 23</strong>: People seem to be interested in the project; excellent! I’ve <a href="https://github.com/borismus/asimov">open sourced</a> the visualization code.</p>

    <title>The Circle by Dave Eggers</title>

      <div>
        <p>The Circle is a thinly veiled parable for, well, Big Tech. At base this book suggests what can happen when high modernism goes too far in the 2010 version of tech. </p>

<p>In some ways, the book feels dated. Even the most cynical observer today will agree that even Facebook is concerned with privacy, even if mainly to mitigate bad PR. Meanwhile the Circle is unabashedly techno utopian, extremely brash. I bet in 2014 when the book came out, it was culturally truer than it feels today. </p>

<p>The Circle slogans are especially on the nose: “All that happens must be known”, “To heal we must know. To know we must share.” And PartiRank? Ha! “Secrets are lies, privacy is theft,  sharing is caring”. I think Eggers is going for the 1984 vibe, but it’s just a little over the top.</p>

<p>Mercer’s antler art commodification episode was pretty effective. The whole Instagram influencer business Mae fell into is prescient. I don't think influencers ousting celebrities was as much of a trend at the time of writing. </p>

<p>Completing the circle feels analogous to building Communism, and a stark reminder that any ideology that tramples over your family and friends is probably bad news. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed the twist in the end. It was so well done from the moment that “Mae knew what she had to do” to Mae’s supposed aversion of the apocalypse, to the ultimate reveal of whose side she ultimately landed on. Other than the twist, the plot was predictable but immensely addictive anyway. I breezed through this book, but it definitely felt like junk food. Big thanks Mr. P for sending it to me!</p>

        <p>I’ve never read Gaiman before, but his various works have frequented my to-read list. I wasn’t too thrilled by Sandman, but misattributed that feeling to the graphic novel medium. I abandoned this collection midway since the stories were often really boring or weirdly sexual. Even the best ones weren’t especially memorable or original. At first I optimistically found this unevenness appealing, like playing roulette. Half way through, I decided to cut my losses.</p>

<p>One of the better stories was hidden in the introduction, but was basically a riff on Picture of Dorian Gray. I also found “Troll”, “Chivalry”, “Queen of Knives” and “Shoggoth” to be entertaining but not memorable. Other stories were just bad, like “Goldfish Pool”, and “White Road”, and “Changes”.</p>

        <p>I’ve been reading and summarizing for five years now (cue Ratatat). I’m not sure that it’s helped much with retention, but at the very least, having an easily searchable corpus of my book-related notes is worthwhile.</p>

<p>A decent year for fiction, I finally read <a href="/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino/">Invisible Cities</a>, which I enjoyed not viscerally, but more as an art piece. I liked <a href="/books/the-fiddler-is-a-good-woman/">The Fiddler is a Good Woman</a> for the author’s ability to retell the same sordid tale from multiple perspectives. <a href="http://localhost:5500/books/diamond-age-by-stephenson-audio/">Diamond Age</a> was a collection of incredible ideas and surprisingly relevant for my job. I also enjoyed <a href="/books/hyperion-by-dan-simmons-audio/">Hyperion</a>, especially Sol Weintraub’s tale, which touched me deeply. <a href="/books/the-fifth-season-by-n-k-jemisin/">The Fifth Season</a> was interesting, but I have some identitarian reservations. I think my overall fiction highlight was <a href="/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio/">Homer’s Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson</a>.</p>

<p>I read two non-fiction books which were a little too extreme for my tastes: <a href="/books/deschooling-society-by-ivan-illich">Deschooling Society</a>, which just read like an angry and ill considered screed and <a href="/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl/">Radical Markets</a>, which had some really interesting ideas, but presented as a whole seemed ridiculous. I really enjoyed <a href="/books/timefulness-by-marcia-bjornerud-audio/">Timefulness</a>, a whirlwind overview of geology, and <a href="/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/">Range</a>, an ode to generalists. The standout non-fiction for me was <a href="/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott/">Seeing Like a State</a>, which will continue to turn over in my mind for years to come. I listened to fewer history lectures than usual, but can wholeheartedly recommend <a href="/books/the-story-of-medieval-england-audio/">The Story of Medieval England</a>. Instead, I focused on parenting books, which are pretty bad as a genre. That said, <a href="/books/the-new-father/">The New Father</a> served as a worthwhile companion to skim during the first year of Eliana’s life, and <a href="/books/yes-brain-by-siegel-and-bryson/">Yes Brain</a> had practical suggestions for digesting mindfulness into something that small children might be able to understand.</p>

<p>I also begun a new long-term book summarization project, which is to digest <a href="">Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery</a>, and visualize it as a Civ-style tech tree. Hopefully I’ll have something to report on that front in 2020!</p>

        <p>Cass suggested I check out The Right It by Alberto Savoia. This book is an ode to an idea: do as much as you can to vet an idea before committing a lot of time and energy on it. In other words, become as confident as possible in product-market fit before spending a lot of resources building even the first version. I strongly agree with the sentiment of the book, and have seen product and research teams fail for this exact reason. That said, it’s quite easy to condense into a substantially smaller format, and I might recommend that (if available) rather than reading the entire book.</p>

<p>Most new ventures fail. Savoia encourages founders to be brutally honest with themselves, make their hypotheses explicit and quantified, and then find clever ways to quickly and cheaply validate them. The steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Come up with an idea (eg. sell old sushi at a discount).</li>
<li>Develop a Market Engagement Hypothesis (eg. A lot of people who want to eat healthy and who like sushi can’t afford to eat it regularly, because sushi tends to be quite expensive. If we can find a way to make sushi as affordable as other fast food, a lot of fast-food patrons will choose sushi over less healthy alternatives.)</li>
<li>Quantify (2) with an X% of Y will do Z. (eg. At least 20% of packaged-sushi eaters will try Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)</li>
<li>Instantiate (3) with a specific, easily testable idea that gets people to put down money (eg. At least 20% of students buying packaged sushi at Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)</li>
<li>Actually run the experiment in (4) using a variety of techniques.</li>
<li>Collect your own data from the experiment in (5).</li>
<li>Compare the data with your hypothesis. If the results are close to the hypothesis, you are on the right track. If they are way off, might be time to throw in the towel.</li>
<li>If things look promising, do a few more runs of (4) - (7).</li>
<li>Ultimately make the decision whether to build it, drop it, or make changes to your plan based on what you learned.</li>
</ol>

<p>Savoia describes a bunch of techniques that may be interesting to apply and riff on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fake door technique: placing a facade of a product and seeing how people engage in it. Will they engage? (eg. A landing page for a website that asks for an email address)</li>
<li>Pinnochio technique: pretending that a dummy object is actually real (eg. The Palm founder who pretended a block of wood was a PDA)</li>
<li>Infiltrator technique: negotiate with a store to show your prototype on their shelves for a limited time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve seen focus groups and traditional user research fail in the exact way that Savoia describes: lack of skin in the game on the part of research participants.</p>

    <title>WebUSB, Arduino, and Nunchucks!</title>

        <p>WebUSB bridges two amazing universes: the open web and the maker movement. Web pages can now talk directly to external hardware over USB, and it works on both mobile and desktop (at least in Chrome). There are a <a href="https://github.com/webusb/arduino">few basic samples</a> out there, but for my own edification, I wanted to get my hands dirty. I hooked up a Wii Nunchuck to an Arduino, and built a webpage to plot sensor readings in real-time. Here’s the resulting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqmtltjk66w">video</a> and <a href="/webusb-arduino/#" title="https://github.com/borismus/sensor-streamer">code</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I used this handy <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/345">breakout board</a> to hook up the Nunchuck to an Arduino Leonardo without having to cut cables and solder. The Arduino runs a sketch which reads sensor values over I2C and sends them to the host webpage over WebUSB. In this case, the host plots the sensor data as it streams in.</p>

<h1>The UX is a mixed bag</h1>

<p>Conveniently, any WebUSB device can be configured to broadcast a specific URL. As soon as you plug it in, Chrome displays a notification telling you that a new device was detected. Clicking the notification will take you directly to the advertised URL. Great!</p>

<p><img src="/webusb-arduino/notification.png" alt="Notification to go to a URL" /></p>

<p>To actually connect to the device, you need a user gesture (button press) to open up a native “Connect to USB device” dialog. You then pick the device from a list, and press the Connect button. Far from frictionless, but it makes sense given the web’s security model.</p>

<p><img src="/webusb-arduino/dialog.png" alt="Webpage wants to connect to device" /></p>

<p>Despite the inconvenience, this is still super interesting, especially for doing one-time setup for a new hardware device. Certainly preferable to requiring the user to install a junky app on their phone!</p>

<h1>Some minor caveats</h1>

<p>WebUSB won’t work with all Arduinos, only those that support a low level USB profile (eg. Emulating a mouse or keyboard). Specifically, the Leonardo is supported, but the Uno is not.</p>

<p>Arduino setup requires installing the <a href="https://github.com/webusb/arduino">WebUSB library</a> manually, and even changing some Arduino header files. This could definitely be streamlined. Also, beware the large number of Wii Nunchuck-related Arduino libraries, all of which seem subtly broken.</p>

<p>Looking forward to using WebUSB in upcoming hardware projects! Stay tuned, and hopefully I’ll have something to share soon.</p>

        <p>I’ll admit, I only got about 20% through this book when I decided to abandon it.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the world building somewhat, but it felt like a really cut-and-dry Tolkien-esque fantasy book without much originality. I’m not sure why it seems to have such great critical acclaim. The character development is what I found weakest. The protagonist Kvothe (perhaps from Kavod?) seems to just be perfect at everything, and the complete center of attention. None of the other characters feel at all developed. </p>

<p><a href="https://chimaeraspeaks.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/kvothe-a-mary-sue-case-study/">This review</a> seems to mirror my sentiments directly. Enough said.</p>

        <p>I think it was A that originally turned me on to Geoff Berner’s existence. At the very least, he gave me the book (thanks!) Berner exists at the tenuous intersection of musician, comedian, and apparently author! I went to a klezmer show in Seattle for which he was one of the openers, and can vouch for him as a pretty good accordionist, and a pretty funny guy (although I still can’t quite tell if he’s serious about his politics). After reading, I can also confirm that Geoff Berner is a pretty good author.</p>

<p>This book is unlike anything I’ve ever read. It reminds me of looking at a subject through a kaleidoscope, or through a series of funhouse mirrors, or maybe that parable about the blind men and the elephant. Except with less arguing.</p>

<p>At its core, this book paints a portrait of a complex protagonist, so-called “DD” from Berner’s bohemian musician crew. He does an excellent job of convincingly channeling his various friends and acquaintances in his quest. Are these people real? I don’t know, but I’ve venture to guess heavily based on existing people and not conjured from thin air. Anyway, the way Berner writes them in is done convincingly, giving each one of them a distinct style and a manner of speaking. Sometimes these characters speak directly at him as if in an interview setting, other times they take turns to paint a vignette.</p>

<p>In some ways, I was reminded of Foobar, the Canadian Cult Classic film. Maybe because many of the characters are in some undeniable sense lowlifes, but in another, profoundly vulnerable and human.</p>

    <title>Range by David Epstein (audio)</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I learned of David Epstein through his interview with <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02019/jul/22/timefulness/">NonProphets</a>, a podcast I enjoy listening to. He had featured one of the generalist podcast hosts in the segment about super forecasters, and came off as super interesting. I had just committed to sorting my reading list by least recent publish date, biasing it towards works that have stood the test of time. But looking over my options in Audible, I kept coming back to Range.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was worth it, although it took me longer to get through than I expected. Partly I’m reading too many books at once, and partly it got a little slow towards the middle and I lost interest when it covered some familiar territory (eg. Superforecasting).</p>

<p>It’s hard to summarize the book in a sentence, since it tries to integrate learnings from many people from many disparate fields into a coherent narrative. </p>

<p>Savants and other specialists do really well in areas with well defined rules: <strong>“kind”</strong> domains. Examples include games like Go and Chess, and answering trivia questions answer to which is well known. Kind problems have robust statistical regularities. But most real world problems are <strong>“wicked”</strong>: many complex considerations, many variables, and no scenario is quite like the next.</p>

<p><strong>Dark horses</strong>: Making an impact in a novel field is inherently inefficient. You can’t just wake up one day and decide “I’m going to change this field”, and follow a narrow path to do that. Hundreds of people have already tried doing this. A more circuitous route is more likely to yield something novel. Rather than obsessively focusing on a narrow topic, creative achievers tend to have broad interests. In a study, vast majority of successful people followed a circuitous path to get to where they got, but believed that “most people don't do it this way”. Dark horses don't worry about falling behind or comparing themselves to peers. Instead they optimize for match quality. Examples of successful people that take winding paths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frances Hesselbein, Girl Scouts</li>
<li>Vincent Van Gogh</li>
<li>Knight, founder of Nike</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gunpei Yokoi</strong> is my new hero. He started Nintendo's electronics division and instilled the company with “Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology”. Yokoi held that toys and games do not necessarily require cutting edge technology; novel and fun gameplay are more important. He suggested that expensive cutting edge technology can get in the way of developing a new product.</p>

<p><strong>Animals are cool</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is stupid to claim that birds are better than frogs because they see farther, or that frogs are better than birds because they see deeper. The world of mathematics is both broad and deep, and we need birds and frogs working together to explore it.” — Freeman Dyson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A finer hierarchy than the binary (foxes, birds, generalists) vs (hedgehogs, frogs, specialists) dichotomy is the hybridization of the two into “polymaths“ or t-shaped people. Not sure about the use of the polymath term though.</p>

<p>It gets even better when you combine the animals you like into one super animal: a flying, actively open minded t-shaped fox with dragonfly eyes. Creepy!</p>

<p><strong>Desirable difficulties</strong>: the idea that learning requires effort. No pain no gain. And as a teacher, you should be creating situations where students are subjected to struggle. This means avoiding excessive hint giving. With too many hints and shortcuts you risk trading deep understanding for expedient monkey business. Speaking of which, really impressive study about macaques memorizing a pattern under various hint giving conditions. Super relevant to some of my current work. </p>

<p><strong>Generation effect</strong>: merely attempting to produce an answer to a question before getting a hint or the correct answer has been shown to result in better recall results. </p>

<p><strong>Child care pro tip</strong>: don't sweat skills that all children will learn, like reading or walking. To impart lasting academic benefits, teach open  skills scaffolding later knowledge. Eg. Hunt for and connect contextual clues to understand what they read. </p>

<p><strong>Cross-disciplinary sleeping beauties</strong>: Papers that include references from two journals that have never been cited from the same paper before (indicating a high degree of cross-disciplinarily)</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially duds</li>
<li>Published in less prestigious journals</li>
<li>Are more likely to become smash hits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Analogies are super powerful</strong>. Apparently Johannes Kepler relied really heavily on analogies for developing his laws of planetary motion. Kepler’s train of thought fancifully reproduced by the author is super enlightening.  The benefit of analogy is that you can more easily take the outside view (Kahneman). “Evaluating an array of options before letting intuition reign is a trick for the Wicked world.”</p>

<p><strong>Carter racing case study</strong> shows that people often to make decisions based on incomplete information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_geology_software">https://www.academia.edu/20358932/Carter_racing_case</a>. In a brilliant twist, the case is modelled after the <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle">Challenger Disaster</a>.</p>

<p>One critique: it’s easy to create a compelling narrative by cherry picking facts. Certainly there are successful hedgehogs, and some child prodigies do change their field. Mozart, for example.</p>

    <title>Timefulness by Marcia Bjornerud (audio)</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I heard the author’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_generation_sustainability">Long Now talk</a> and thought she did an excellent job. The book did not disappoint.</p>

<p>Most people, myself included, lack a scientific foundation for understanding complex issues like climate change. As a result, discourse around the issue is split into either denial (right) and panic (left). Both are negative, paralyzing emotions.  I’d rather find a constructive middle path. </p>

<p>Backpacking together through the canyons of the Pariah, I watched the landscape with a sense of heightened curiosity. Dad and I had front row seats to observe nature’s processes at work: rivers carving deeper and deeper into slot canyons, erosion’s cleaver splitting gigantic sandstone faces in twain. In a place like the Vermillion Cliffs, you can really feel the Earth’s sovereignty. We are ants. </p>

<p>How might we bring this feeling of scientific curiosity and majestic awe to more people?</p>

<p>Here’s an interesting analogy to kick the book off:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microscope to see small things</li>
<li>Telescope to see far away things</li>
<li>Geology to “see” long ago things</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all the book is short and merely serves to whet the appetite. The author starts with a historical background, goes on to explain some of the science and provide a quick chronology of the Earth (a condensation of her already condensed course), and ends with a discussion about climate change and the future. It’s quite dense in many sections. In general, the author packs a ton of content into a short book, and I learned a huge amount.</p>

<p>Geology is a new science. Our fundamental understanding of plate tectonics can be traced to just 1965. It’s also a cross-disciplinary science featuring "whole brain thinking" and leaning heavily on visualization. Indeed, there’s a whole world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyrd">geology visualization software</a> which I have yet to explore. </p>

<p>High level overview of earth's life as we know today. </p>

<ul>
<li>Cenozoic: 66 - 0 Ma (<strong>M</strong>illion years <strong>a</strong>go)</li>
<li>Mesozoic: 252 - 66 Ma</li>
<li>Paleozoic: 541 - 252 Ma</li>
<li>Precambrian: 4600 - 541 Ma</li>
</ul>

<p>Right off the bat, Marcia injects some pessimism. We used to be citizens, she laments, now are mere consumers. We used to support long term projects like national parks. Now we view them as a tax burden. Do we?</p>

<p>Tons of interesting people I know very little about: <strong>James Hutton</strong>, father of modern geology, first coined the term “deep time” in the 18th century. <strong>Charles Lyell</strong>, building on Hutton’s work eventually inspired Charles Darwin. </p>

<p>There’s a debate between two schools of thought, one represented by the 3 great men above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gradualism (Uniformitarianism) - slow incremental changes, such as erosion, created all the Earth's geological features.</li>
<li>Catastrophism - the Earth has largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Age of the earth</strong>: In 1897, Lord Kelvin, refuting Darwin’s estimate of 300 million years, ultimately settled on an estimate that the Earth was 20–40 million years old. This was based on heat equations that didn’t take into account radiation. Substantially later, Arthur Holmes, father of modern geochronology, developed carbon dating techniques. The oldest Archean rocks he found were 1.6 billion years old. The latest estimate is that earth is 4.5 billion years old.</p>

<p>Interesting balance between erosion and accretion. The Himalayas accrete quickly, but also erode quickly, and the two processes mostly cancel each other out (growing very slowly). The total mass of earth crust in river basins around Himalayas is greater than that of the mountain range itself. </p>

<p><strong>Volcano formation</strong>: Also interesting is the role of water in the formation of volcanoes. Water gets into the earth’s crust underneath oceans. As the porous waterlogged basalt cools and descends into the magma, the water causes the melting point to decrease. As the rock melts and escapes upward from the pressure, it forms volcanoes. This is how New Zealand formed and many other atolls. </p>

<p><strong>Seafloor spreading</strong>: When volcanos erupt, molten iron comes up to the surface. These iron crystals are pulled into alignment by the Earth’s magnetic field, just like a compass needle is pulled towards magnetic north. Once the basalt cools completely into solid rock, the alignment of the iron minerals is fixed. Thus, patterns on the sea floor preserve a permanent record of the strength and direction of Earth’s magnetic field at the time the rocks were formed. (This is so cool!)</p>

<p>Natural CO2 capture mechanism (part of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_impacts_of_climate_change">carbon cycle</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li>Volcanic exhalation causes CO2 emissions</li>
<li>Mixing with water vapour, it forms H2CO3</li>
<li>This dissolves crust rocks over time.</li>
<li>These form CaCO3 which is carried by rivers into the oceans.</li>
<li>Organisms use this for building shells.</li>
<li>When they die, their remains form limestone in the sea floor, sequestering the carbon in (1).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Slowing rotation</strong>: Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation.</p>

<p>A large section of the book is dedicated to history and chronology of the Earth. Here are some fascinating milestones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Oxidation Event (GOE), 2400 million years ago (Ma). formerly water was oxygen free which meant all sorts of ions could float in it freely including iron. After GOE, this changed and oxygen infusion bonded with Fe+ causing rust to sink down into the ocean floor.</li>
<li>Boring Billion, 1.8 Ga - 0.8 Ga. Not many changes to life, earth, etc. Single celled organisms only.</li>
<li>Snowball Earth (theorized), 0.7 Ga. Earth's surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen. Likely due in part to the albedo effect: the cooler it gets the more ice and snow there is on the Earth’s surface. So more sun is reflected and it gets even cooler.</li>
<li>Fascinating to think about: 1.5 billion years in the future the earth won't be habitable to any life since the sun will have warmed enough to boil the oceans.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background rate of extinction</strong>: Surprising way to think about extinctions in aggregate. This is generally slow and continuous but accelerated during periods of mass extinctions. The dinosaur asteroid wiped out 85% of life living on land. Apparently today we're seeing 1000x the base extinction rate. </p>

<p><strong>Anthropocene</strong>: Coined in 2002 (I thought much later) as a new epoch dating from when humans have had large impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems. </p>

<p>I think we in the PNW are lucky and won’t be directly affected by climate change. But what I think will matter is its secondary effect on political stability and human migration. It's going to deepen existing conflicts and create new pressure. Including what I think is most likely cause of human extinction still: global nuclear war. </p>

<p><strong>Why do ice ages occur</strong>: Known as Milankovitch cycles, a few variables change in a periodic manner:
1. Orbital shape (from nearly circular to slightly elliptical), primarily due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn)
2. Axial tilt (21-24 deg with period of 41000 years) and variations in Earth’s orbit around the sun.
3. Axial precession (I don’t fully understand this yet).</p>

<p><strong>Human emissions</strong>: 500 gigatons (GT) of carbon emitted by humans. 25% of that was since 2000. And the rate of our emissions is still increasing. Currently it’s at about 10 GT per year. </p>

<p>I like that Ygrassil made an appearance here too, most recently encountered in Hyperion. Not sure how it fits really, but the author went on a bit of a tangent towards the end, floating some  possibly <a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org/">inauthentic Iroquois legends</a>, and the Norse concept of <a href="https://www.peps.org/">Wyrd</a>.</p>

<p>This book had a lot of facts packed into a small package (short listen). Two main directions I’d like to go into:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A bit more into geological visualizations and making things more accessible to the layperson
\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt; HEAD</p>

    <title>Toddler’s First Music Box</title>

    <updated>2019-09-26T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/toddler-music-box</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Toddler toys are stacked with blinking lights, loud attention seeking noises, and earworm songs. They are often made of plastic and sadly, feel cheap. My daughter deserves better! </p>

<p>So I set out to design her a perfect music box: an old concept infused with modern technology, without subjecting her to the hazards of screens. I wanted the box to play her favorite songs, be durable and portable, have long battery life, all while being a beautiful object. This is the result:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS879aGP6O0"><img src="/toddler-music-box/final-box.jpg" alt="My daughter’s music box" /></a></p>

<!--more-->

<h1>Building a portable music player</h1>

<p>My first instinct was to try to build this using a Raspberry Pi,  but turns out running Linux has a few major downsides:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eeking out reasonable battery life is really difficult.</li>
<li>Boot times are very slow, in the 10s of seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>An alternative to running embedded Linux is programming a prototyping board directly. So I dusted off an old Arduino Uno and discovered the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/94">Adafruit Wave Shield</a>, which does exactly what I needed. It reads audio from an SD card, and plays it back through a speaker. When the Wave Shield kit arrived, I was somewhat shocked to see a bare PCB and all of the components in a little baggie. </p>

<p>Luckily, there’s an incredible Makerspace at work, so I dropped by after my actual work was done, picked up a soldering iron, and got to work. I’ve soldered before, but not much since my favorite class of all time: Making Things Interact at CMU, taught by Mark Gross. Initially daunting, I knocked it out in no time thanks to some really detailed instructions. The results were amazing. Fuse a bunch of metal and silicon together, attach a battery and 1.5 seconds later (that’s the boot time), a song is playing through the speaker! Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

<p><img src="/toddler-music-box/solder.jpg" alt="Soldering the Adafruit Wave Hat" /></p>

<h1>Randomly playing songs</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-wave-shield-audio-shield-for-arduino/play6-hc">sample software</a> for the Wave Shield plays all of the .wav files on the SD card in lexical order. I wanted something a bit more delightful than playing the same playlist in the same order. So I wrote a program that plays a random song instead. Easy peasy, here we go.</p>

<p>I enumerated all of the wavs on the card and stored all of their filenames in a <code>char**</code> dynamically allocated on the heap. Oops! There’s barely enough space there to allocate a dozen file names, and I’d selected 60 songs. It appears that years of front-end UI engineering have dulled my low level embedded software development instincts. After fighting the C++ compiler about static 2D array allocation, I took a simpler and more memory efficient approach, first counting all of the songs, then picking a random song number to play. </p>

<p>Even generating random numbers is non-trivial, since there’s no reliable absolute clock to use as a seed - the device cold-starts every time. Instead, I’m using a technique which reads in analog inputs for a pseudo random input. This may or may not be a good idea, but seems to provide some variation. Anyway, the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/toddler-music-box">Arduino sketch</a> is in the GitHub repo.</p>

<h1>Prototyping in plastic</h1>

<p>One of the great perks of my work’s Makerspace is access to all sorts of awesome prototype manufacturing equipment, including a <a href="https://www.inventables.com/technologies/carvey">Carvey</a>. So I went to Rockler and bought a 5”x5” maple block, thinking I’d hollow it out into a box with the CNC machine. Not so fast! It’d take a mere 15 hours of drilling. </p>

<p>Rather than wait, I opted for a faster route: prototyping with 3D printing. So I began designing music boxes on paper, then in OnShape, then printing them using the <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/">Prusa</a> printers. Seeing a design evolve from figment of imagination to tangible physical object is incredibly satisfying. However, once that satisfaction wore off, I can honestly say that the results were functional, but not at all aesthetically pleasing:</p>

<p><img src="/toddler-music-box/plastic-box.jpg" alt="Early 3D printed plastic box" /></p>

<h1>That old time wooden aesthetic</h1>

<p>So I went for a different strategy: buy a nice off-the-shelf box to house everything and just design its insides. This way, the 3D print is mostly hidden, and can be capped off with a laser cut or CNC milled wooden lid. I can learn about CNC joinery later.</p>

<p>I found a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WFSRBD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">nice hexagonal box</a> on Amazon and bought two, discarding both lids. The bottom half of the clam would house the Arduino, Shield and battery, while the top would house the speaker. They’d be connected with a speaker wire and joined by wood hinges.</p>

<p>Designing the innards was a delight. <a href="https://www.onshape.com">OnShape’s</a> UI is excellent and responsive. The constraint system makes a lot of sense, sketching on arbitrary surfaces and then extruding them is amazingly powerful. The Assembly View and Edit-in-Context feature made aligning elements between upper and lower clamshells a cinch. This included the speaker wire port and holes for the microswitch. I experimented with a variety of designs for fastening lid to container. Initially, I opted for ambitious <a href="https://markforged.com/blog/embedding-nuts-3d-printing/">embedded nut</a> designs, but ultimately went with a self-tapping (into plastic) approach using <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Hardware-Fasteners-Screws/Internal-Hex/Flat/N-5yc1vZc2b0Z1z0sfp4Z1z0sgtn">flat head screws</a>. For fastening electronics to the plastic, I printed offsets and used nuts.</p>

<p>After a few iterations of fastener tweaking, design adjustments, and measurement corrections, I had a top insert for housing the speaker, and a speaker grille to protect the speaker’s membrane, a bottom insert for housing the electronic core, and a cover to hide them. The <a href="https://github.com/borismus/toddler-music-box">STL files</a> are all in the GitHub repo. Here’s the result:</p>

<p>If you’re curious, the <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/786c5f0b153cdd48f9b0f2f8/w/b4275650dc7aac134e30275f/e/4a850077e5ce208659a14aab">OnShape project is public</a>, you just need to make an OnShape account.</p>

<h1>Toddler user testing</h1>

<p>Once everything was in place, it was time for toddler testing! Luckily I have a very cute and curious user on retainer for the next 18 years. I asked her to open the box, and when she did, she began wiggling along to Cat Stevens’ “la-la-la”s. I’ve since corrected the poor initial music choice – the music box now plays a healthy milieu of classics from Soviet cartoons.</p>

<p>A few other things became immediately clear as a result of user testing:</p>

<ol>
<li>My daughter was completely fascinated by the small speaker wire running between the top and bottom lid. She kept pulling at it, and eventually the wire came out enough to prevent the lid from closing fully.</li>
<li>Predictably, she loves abusing the box in creative ways. At one point she was dancing on top of the box. Then she used it as a step stool to climb onto the couch. Later, she smashed the box so hard the microswitch toggled and restarted the music.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the current version, I’ve concealed the speaker wire in nylon casing and affixed it on both ends using zipties. This solves the first issue where the wire would prevent the box from closing. I’ve also padded the battery pack so that the contents of the box rattles less, hopefully making it less satisfying to shake and smash.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how much battery life I’ll get from this construction, but it’s been running off the same triple AAA pack for about a week of sporadic play with maybe a couple of hours of being actually on. The fact that the device is fully off when the lid is closed (and not secretly draining batteries) makes me happy.</p>

<p>Finally, massive thanks to Matthew Wilson and Jon Ward for their sage advice and friendly encouragement with this project. How might we imbue other beautiful everyday objects with magical abilities?</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

    <title>Yes Brain by Siegel and Bryson</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Yes Brain is a parenting book. This immediately means several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s extremely repetitive.</li>
<li>It sports branding. “Yes Brain™ – good. No Brain – bad”. </li>
<li>This is strictly necessary because parents are chronically sleep deprived and can’t focus for more than five minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the overall framework within which the book operates:</p>

<p>Children are born with a fully developed “downstairs brain” (roughly aka limbic system, lizard brain, system one), which controls involuntary response. As they grow, they are developing their “upstairs brain” (cortex, system two), in charge of higher level thought. So as children develop, many of their reactions are driven by system one. The parent’s role is to help develop system two. This means going from a predominantly reactive stimulus-response mode to “response flexibility”: being able to choose how to respond to a stimulus.</p>

<p>I find this to be a useful framework in general. All but the most enlightened meditators could use a bit more response flexibility. The most useful parts of this book describe strategies for explaining what this might look like to young children. Unfortunately for me, most examples in the book focus on 5, 8, 13 year olds. One of the most approachable frameworks is based on colors, which my toddler has yet to learn. So I think we have a prerequisite to fill first!</p>

<p>The green zone is a state where response flexibility is maximized. The red zone is a tantrum or lack of control. The blue zone is withdrawal after a pattern of bad feedback. The parental role is to expand the green zone, make children spent more time there, and make returning to green faster. The authors suggest teaching the model to the kids as well to be able to talk about it, and spend some time discussing what that would look like through fairly insightful comics.</p>

<p>Other things I liked included some Stoically inspired advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>There’s an explicit discussion of walking children through tough times without coddling them. In the dismal language of the authors, it’s about finding the “goldilocks balance” between “pushin’” and “cushin’”.</li>
<li>Reframing when kids misbehave. It may be useful to treat this as a form of communication. See it as a call for help rather than them acting out and making things hard for you.</li>
<li>Present difficult situations as “which struggle do you prefer?”. Seems handy to reframe pain as a learning experience.</li>
<li>Try on the outside view to learn to get some emotional distance from the problem at hand. They have a great analogy  of being a player player vs. being a spectator.</li>
<li>For empathy, it’s useful to practice in children’s books: What is the person feeling right now?</li>
</ul>

<p>Random things I disliked:</p>

<ul>
<li>The authors reject any external measuring sticks. A lot of the book emphasized process over results to such an extreme that it conflates extrinsic plenty with intrinsic poverty. In my mind, you should aim for both.</li>
<li>Let’s sprinkle in <strong>neuroscience</strong> to make the book sound more scientistic! Name-dropping the connectome adds nothing, but makes me more annoyed.</li>
<li>Conveniently, the authors provide a “Yes Brain Refrigerator Sheet”, a built-in summary of the book. Sadly it is very bad and doesn’t include the actual good parts of the book.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good parts of this book provide some interesting strategies for teaching stoicism and mindfulness to young children. Perhaps in a few years, I’ll revisit one of its many clones.</p>

        <p>A parismonious use of pixels (160 x 114) and color (four-color greenscale) lends
itself super well to reproduction as a LEGO mosaic! LEGO has this amazing
service called
<a href="https://www.lego.com/page/static/pick-a-brick#shopxlink">Pick-a-Brick</a> where
you can buy spare parts that accidentally ended up in your vacuum cleaner's
dustbin. Or you can buy tiles and flats and make an awesome mosaic based on your
favorite 2-bit sprite. But how many tiles of each color do you need? Not to
worry, I've got you covered with this <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lego-mosaic/blob/master/count_colors.py">color counting
script</a>.
Fully assembled, two-bit LEGO Link makes an excellent coaster for the office
mug.</p>

<p>I'm not much of a gamer, but Zelda is the one series that continues to occupy a
special place in my heart. Link's Awakening was my first, and remains my
favorite. Twenty five years later, the most memorable part of the game was of
course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NccSaUwoibM">the music</a>. But the
graphics were amazing in their own right. This to me is concentrated nostalgia:</p>

<p><img src="/zelda-lego/links-awakening.png" alt="Screenshot Link's awakening" /></p>

<p>The mosaic is based directly on the most iconic sprite from the game: Link and
his shield strolling sideways through Koholint Island. Here's the colorized
version from the DX version:</p>

<p><img src="/zelda-lego/awakening-link-side-16x16-scaled.png" alt="Link sprite" /></p>

<p>I tried making a Link mosaic from my second favorite, Zelda: Link to the Past.
Unfortunately, a 16-bit color palette is way harder to replicate with LEGO's
limited set of colors, and the result isn't worth sharing.</p>

    <title>Diamond Age by Stephenson (audio)</title>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/diamond-age-by-stephenson-audio</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>It's official: I'm on a science fiction kick! It's been a while since I
read Stephenson. It's not that I don't like reading long books, I do. It's just
a question of bang for the buck. Diamond Age stood out because of the
Illustrated Primer, which is relevant to my interests in education, and
Young Ladies, one of which I have the pleasure to be raising. And it wasn't too
long.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed it. The world building was especially compelling: a few
hundred years into the future, an earthbound humanity has balkanized into
tribes. These are not geographically bound but global, with enclaves in every
major city. This strikes me as both interesting as a concept, and plausible as a
way for our already fragile multiculturalism to unravel more fully. </p>

<p>As Diamond Age is a Stephenson book, there are many concrete tech-related ideas
that are worth mentioning.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Matter Compiler - a way to synthesize matter of any kind. At seemingly
arbitrarily large scales if you have the funds. (Incidentally, I excitedly
mentioned Matter Compilers in a recent tweet, comparing 3D printing to Matter
Compilers and got roasted for it by a UW professor!)</p></li>
<li><p>Mites - nano-technological robots that can do almost anything. Very much
indistinguishable from magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Neo-Victorians - a tribe living with Victorian ideals loyal to some vestigual
British monarchy headed by Queen Victoria II: hierarchy, order, aristocracy.
They have a social structure and dukes most of which graduate from careers as
successful entrepreneurs.</p></li>
<li><p>The Illustrated Primer - an interactive book designed for a Neo-Victorian
princess to have an “interesting” childhood so that she grows up to make a
dent on the world. The Primer is both adaptive and personalized, and is at the
core of Diamond Age.</p></li>
<li><p>Ractors - Remote Actors that are instrumented in a way that allows them to do
a very advanced form of voice and motion capture.</p></li>
<li><p>Cheveleens: electromechanical horse-robots often used by Neo-Victorians as
transportation. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a nearly 30 year old book, I'm surprised at how well it's aged. Written in
1996, most aspects come off as very modern, alluding to a distributed web and
distributed ledgers. Brain-computer interfaces are pervasive in the story, and
continue to remain a speculative and illusive area of research.  Some of the
tech has aged poorly, but this is more endearing than annoying. Data is stored
on tape drives, large amounts of it is expressed in gigabytes.</p>

<p>If I was to edit Diamond Age, I'd skip the computer science education parts.
Nell's Illustrated Primer adventures in Castle Turing rely on thinly veiled
analogies that aren't especially insightful.  Wordy passages compare zeros and
ones to two sorts of links in a chain. Stephenson literally explains ASCII
codes. To someone that knows these concepts well, it's boring. To someone that
doesn't, I think it would be boring too. I was distracted by the endless
metaphors between orgies and distributed computing -- typical Stephenson.
Group sex is considerably more entertaining to read and write about than
networking.</p>

<p>Overall, the book felt stronger viewed as a world building exercise rather
than a coherent work of fiction. This despite the some really colorful
characters and an engaging story overall. Some of my favorites were Lord
Finkel-McGraw, Carl Hollywood, Judge Fang, and Dr. X, and the narrator's
entertaining delivery helped. Other major characters start off interesting, but
transform into nagging loose ends: what happened to Nell's guardian Constable
Moore? And to her friends Elizabeth and Fiona?</p>

<p>The plot jumps in ways that force the reader to fill in the gaps, and the
traverse between Nell's reality and the world of the Illustrated Primer can be
disorienting. But if memory serves, this is not unlike Stephenson's other books.
Snow Crash comes to mind. The Drummers, the First Distributed
Republic and other crypto-adjacent tribes were the most mysterious and difficult
to understand elements of the story. Not unlike real life, I might add! </p>

<p>The ending is ambiguous but still satisfying. I can't help but wonder: was the
primer comissioned deliberately to subvert the world order by Finkel-McGraw?</p>

    <title>Hyperion by Dan Simmons (audio)</title>

      <div>
        <p>I attempted Hyperion a decade or so ago, but couldn't get into it. If I recall,
I found the introduction obscure and difficult to follow and gave up.
However, after many of my friends raved about it, I gave it another shot, and
really loved it.</p>

<p>Set in a far, post-Earth, space-faring future, the Hyperion universe is really
compelling. A core group of planets is run by a giant corporation with
relatively little opposition from rebellious factions. Interstellar FTL travel
is commonplace. Everyone seems to be basically human, but there are really fun
variations. I especially enjoyed the templars and their treeships, giant living,
space-traveling trees like Yggdrasil, which initially housed the party bound for
Hyperion.</p>

<p>The book itself unfolds as a thrilling mystery set in this wonderful universe.
Narratively, it's modeled after the Canterbury Tales. A rag-tag group of
pilgrims each tells his story en-route to their destination. The stories are the
best part. Each one stands on its own, and the fact that they are all set in the
same universe, and are all about one planet make it feel like you're hearing
each blind man's description of the elephant in turn.</p>

<p>All of the stories are about Hyperion and the Shrike, but more importantly, are
very emotionally moving. I found the Catholic priest storyline to be totally
gut-wrenching, but that was just the beginning. My favorite by far was Saul
Weintraub's daughter Rachel, aging backwards. This might be my personal bias: I
too am the Jewish father of a young daughter. But more likely, it's incredibly
well written. Sauls struggles with God and the problem of theodicy in a way that
is far more heartfelt than any theoretical treatise on the subject. The final
story told by the Consul about his grandfather Merin's is also great, and the
conversation with dolphins "scene" is incredible. There is so much more there,
though: romantic implications of time dilation, the chronological complexity in
the narrative, flashbacks and flashes forward are masterfully written. Kassad's
and Silenius' stories are also excellent and stand on their own, although less
compelling than the aforementioned in my opinion. Lamia's tale was emotionally
weaker and leaned too heavily on AI mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>Each sub-story is so diverse, and spawns so many questions, it feels nearly
impossible to integrate into a final product. I shouldn't be surprised at the
cliffhanger ending. I did find that the book lost some steam towards the
very end, but this is excusable given that Hyperion is the first of four highly
acclaimed books. Whether or not the series itself wraps up coherently, the way
to read this book is to enjoy the Hyperion universe and each of the pilgrim's
tales for their brilliance in their own right.</p>

    <title>Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <blockquote>
  <p>I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. – Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of this book agrees emphatically with this Twain quote. Fundamentally,
Illich believes that "universal education through schooling is not feasible". 
Did you know that "schole", the origin of the word "school" and "школа", is the
greek word for leisure? The book is written as a collection of essays. Overall,
Illich is an Anarchist, and the essays are too radical for me temperament.</p>

<h2>Why We Must Disestablish School</h2>

<p>A scathing, radical critique of modernity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medical treatment is mistaken for healthcare, social work for the improvement
  of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national
  security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity,
  independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the
  performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illich also seems to think that schools are flawed because they won't lead to
equal outcomes for rich and poor. But he seems to discount the fact that a poor
but schooled person would presumably be better off than a poor unschooled one. A
rising tide lifts all boats.</p>

<p>One area where I agree is to "detach competence from curriculum", and make it
taboo to ask people where they studied and how they came to have their skills.
Another interesting argument is that "most learning happens casually", in the
way that children learn a language, or even adults do it situationally (rarely
in language class).</p>

<p>Illich strongly advocates for apprenticeship models, arguing that "all education
was complex, lifelong, and unplanned". He gives examples of making schooling
more effective by taking into account personalized context: "Paolo Freire [...]
discovered that any adult can begin to read in a matter of fourty hours if
the first words he deciphers are charged with political meaning."</p>

<p>He suggests opening the market to for students to find appropriate teachers for
them. Even more intriguingly, here's a startup idea. I've redacted some
antiquated parts (the essay is written in 1970):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each man [...] could identify himself to a computer, indicating the book,
  article, film, or recording on which he seeks a partner for discussion [...] and
  arrange for a meeting with others who recently had taken the same initiative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine doing this today, restoring coffee shops as <a href="/books/palaces-for-the-people">social
infrastructure</a> for <a href="/books/the-coffee-house-a-cultural-history/">intellectual
conversation</a>.</p>

<p>School, Illich argues, is divisive, splintering society into the schooled (white
collar) and unschooled (blue collar). Education becomes unworldly and the world
becomes noneducation.</p>

<h2>Phenomenology of School</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The school system is a modern phenomenon, as is the childhood it produces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinatingly, until the Second Vatican Council in 1962, each child was
instructed that a Christian reaches moral discernment and freedom at the age of
seven.</p>

<p>I think Illich unfairly claims that adults tend to romanticize their schooling,
attributing their learning to a beloved teacher, not giving enough credit to
teachers that really inspire their pupils, spot talent, provide encouragement.
Surely many pupils end up pursuing higher ed in a field because of a high school
teacher.</p>

<p>But he fairly critiques the institution of school for giving a single teacher
too many roles: "custodian, preacher/moralist, and therapist".</p>

<p>Overall I find his take super idealistic. I wonder if he had kids? The fact that
school provides childcare is like a super important aspect of it for most
families, and increasingly so as more women are in the workforce.</p>

<p>I got through the third essay, but it was a slog. Overall, there are interesting
tidbits but the overall tone is so anarchic, marxist and idealistic, I found it
a draining read.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Asimov attempts to create a real-world technology chronology. This reminds me of
the tech trees found in strategy games like Civilization. This encyclopedic tome
is not a book you would normally read cover to cover, and I'll be honest: I'm
only less than a quarter of the way through. I read from the beginning of time
to 1519 (500a), just to get a feeling for the book, and really learned a lot.
Some surprising things about early human history:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dizzying array of horse-related inventions: metal stirrups giving more
stability to the rider, iron horseshoes to let horses travel further,
horse collars to increase pulling capacity by 5x.</li>
<li>The perfect plow, called the Moldboard or Turnplow had a vertical knife-blade
that cut deep into the earth. Useful for damp, moist ground, led to increase
in carrying capacity.</li>
<li>Telling time, from water clocks to more accurate weight-powered
mechanical clocks, to spring powered watches that could be much smaller.</li>
</ul>

<p>But also, let me nitpick a bit. In addition to inventions, the author spends an
inordinate amount of time on geographic discoveries, which feels disconnected
from the rest of the narrative.  Some other "discoveries" are hard to square
with the rest of the content, such as "the rational interpretation of dreams",
first discovered? invented? in 480 BC.</p>

<p>Although an attempt is made to be international, some entries are extremely
Euro-centric. For example, the entry on fermentation is dated 1800 BCE, but
according to Wikipedia, fermentation was actually first done in 6000 BCE in
china. Many other inventions also chronicle explicitly the arrival of the
technology to Europe, such as Gunpowder which is dated 1249 CE but as the entry
admits, was first used to scare Chinese enemies in 1044 CE. The listed date was
when the technology arrived in Europe and was perfected to make serious
weaponry. My last critique is that some of the writing felt stilted and
inconsistent. I imagine that Asimov worked more on the skeleton, and perhaps let
a ghostwriter fill in the details.</p>

<p>Despite some shortcomings, Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery is a
really impressive tome, and a reference book I'll keep close by. I've started on
a summary of the chronology in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lBahJh5UEYEPgamNpyWAaxAQOLO6088nLiBjQW9zr2U/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet
form</a>.
Please help me by filling in the remainder of the spreadsheet for the remaining
500 years (1519 - 2019). My goal is to ultimately generate a visual,
Civilization-style technology tree for this whole book.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The phrase "palaces for the people" comes from Andrew Carnegie. A prolific
philanthropist, Carnegie helped to fund more than 2,500 libraries around the
world.</p>

<p>Initially excited by a systematic, long form look into an issue I care deeply
about, I picked up this book after hearing Eric Klinenberg talk on 99%
Invisible. Reading the book, I found the library-related discussions to be most
coherent, and also found many disparate nuggets that piqued my curiosity,
including many social-minded projects I hadn't heard of before. But overall,
the book's scope is so huge that I think the author failed to conjure a coherent
narrative. In addition, I often found the tone overly didactic and pandering to
a particular audience.</p>

<p>The author draws on a wide variety of authors I've recently become familiar with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robert Putnam (Bowling Alone): social capital has been declining since the
1960s.</li>
<li>Charles Murray (Coming Apart)</li>
<li>Jane Jacobs (The Death and Life of Great American Cities)</li>
<li>James Scott (Seeing Like a State): high modernism and optimization is at odds
with social infrastructure.</li>
<li>Sherry Turkle (Alone Together): we don't talk to each other anymore because of
digital devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprising facts about libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Usage is increasing in the US.</li>
<li>Circulation is led by Seattle in annual book circulation per capita.</li>
<li>Along with Military and First Responders, the most respected institutions.</li>
<li>Used in a wide variety of ways, far more than just lending books
(eg. virtual senior bowling leagues -- take that Robert Putnam)</li>
</ul>

<p>My favorite part included examples of hard infrastructure (eg. electric grid,
sewer system, transit networks, levies) doubling as social infrastructure.  A
levy can double as a walking path. An example is a new project in Manhattan
called the <a href="http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/our-work/all-proposals/winning-projects/big-u">Big
U</a>,
where flood walls will double as gallery and public space.  This is just like
the Richmond Dyke, an embankment which prevents the suburb where I grew up from
flooding. Richmond is below sea level, and situated in a river delta. Also, old
physical infrastructure can be repurposed to be more social. This often happens
with waterfront renovation projects. For example, when the Embarcadero highway
fell in the 1989 SF quake, it was converted into a much better waterfront. In
Seattle and Vancouver, viaducts along the water are being replaced with much
more human-friendly infrastructure. Tons of examples of former rail lines being
turned into vibrant public spaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Orleans: Lafitte Greenway</li>
<li>Atlanta: Green Belt</li>
<li>Seattle: Burke Gilman Trail</li>
<li>Portland: Springwater Corridor</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of public spaces, Frederick Law Olmsted and his sons were also
mentioned. This gave me an excuse to look a bit deeper. Like Carnegie, who left
a legacy in libraries, the Olmsteads left their legacy in America's parks.
Olmstead Sr. is considered the father of landscape architecture, and his son FLO
Jr. designed Olmstead Point in Yosemite, one of my favorite places. As it turns
out, the Olmstead brothers <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olmsted_parks_in_Seattle">planned most of Seattle's
parks</a>.</p>

<p>Also interesting discussion about public baths and their role as social
infrastructure. In Finland the public pools help build social cohesion.
Swimming in the same place means you accept other bodies. They are used to meet
neighbors, and even complain to elected representatives. Of course, Finland is
quite demographically homogenous. In contrast, the US had many pool related
battles between blacks and whites during the Civil Rights era. </p>

<p>Among the painful parts of the book hand wringing about the veracity of the
Broken Window Theory. But the conclusion is what really put a nail in the
coffin. Suddenly all of the memes are in full force: Trump is Evil Incarnate.
Tech is to blame for all of the Bay Area's problems. Facebook is The Absolute
Worst. It's not that I disagree with these sentiments, but stop flogging a dead
horse. (Meta: one of the reasons I love books is that they are timeless, and
less about knee-jerk reactions to current events. This is less true for new
releases that have not passed the test of time.)</p>

<p>The author defines Social Infrastructure as "the physical conditions that
determine if social capital can flourish". Immediately my mind went to the
digital equivalent: Social <strong>Digital</strong> Infrastructure. "the <strong>physical</strong>
conditions that determine if social capital can flourish".</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this book cements an idea I've been wrangling with. Over the last
little while, I've attempted a number of projects that try to improve social
discourse online. That they have all failed does not necessarily mean that there
is no hope for systems that try to foster social infrastructure digitally, but I
now believe that my efforts were somewhat misguided. I strongly agree with this
sentiment expressed by the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local face to face interactions are the building blocks of all public life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would have liked to read more about examples of digital infrastructure
intended to impact the real world. Also, why does Meetup have such awful
attrition? I propose a law:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Law of Meetup Attrition</strong>: the number of people that show up to an event is
  1/3 the number of people that sign up for it. The number of people that sign up
  to an event is 1/30 the number of people in the meetup group.</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>The Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson (audio)</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio"/>
    
    <updated>2019-06-14T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>As a kid, I read The Odyssey in some canonical translation. That is to say, I
knew it was a classic, and wanted to check the box. I read it quickly and
retained nothing from the experience. When I learned about this new, accessible
translation from Tyler Cowen's interview with the translator, my interest was
piqued.</p>

<p>In an extended intro, Wilson justified the constraints of her translation. I
agreed with her that constraints are fun to work within, and found the specifics
of translating from dactylic hexameter the meter of all homeric epic poems, to
iambic pentameter the usual meter of English classics to be super
interesting. Impressively, she also constrained herself to the same number of
lines as the original. All this while keeping to modern language that isn't
overly flowery or archaic. In her own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But of course, the English of the nineteenth or early twentieth century is no
  closer to Homeric Greek than the language of today. The use of a noncolloquial
  or archaizing linguistic register can blind readers to the real, inevitable, and
  vast gap between the Greek original and any modern translation. My use of
  contemporary language—rather than the English of a generation or two ago—is
  meant to remind readers that this text can engage us in a direct way, and also
  that it is genuinely ancient. My Homer does not speak in your grandparents'
  English, since that language is no closer to the wine-dark sea than your own. I
  have tried to keep to a register that is recognizably speakable and readable,
  while skirting between the Charybdis of artifice and the Scylla of slang.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I loved Claire Danes' reading of the translated poem, and Audible's production,
especially that little blooming musical flourish in the end. I wonder how hard
it was for the producers to be so parsimonious with effects.</p>

<h2>Recurring themes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hospitality</strong>: There's a steady emphasis on hospitality as a way to appease
gods, especially Zeus. There is an element of it being encouraged in general,
and an element of fear: any old beggar may in fact be a god in disguise. It
plays out in the narrative too when the suitors' evil is illustrated in their
disdain for Odysseus disguised as a beggar.</li>
<li><strong>Weaving women</strong>: Every great woman spins cloth, including all noble wives
and most notably Penelope.</li>
<li><strong>Gods concealing as humans</strong>: Athena is often disguised as Mentor,
Telemachus' ally and advisor. The pattern of Gods disguised as familiar people
is super compelling as a narrative device. There are moments in life
when it feels that way, no?</li>
<li><strong>Constant bitching</strong>: Odysseus is constant bitching about how hard his life
is, while his crew is dying left and right. This is odd -- under such dire
circumstances, should he not be glad to be alive?</li>
<li><strong>Metaphors for Dawn</strong>: I really liked all of the descriptions of Dawn. Rosy
fingered, braided, Dawn on her golden throne, bright-throned Dawn.</li>
<li><strong>Awesome monsters</strong>: Polyphemus the cyclops eats Odysseus' crew, Circe the
nymph turns them into swine, The Sirens lure his men to thier doom, Scylla, a
giant six headed sea hydra decimates his ships and Charybdis, a whirlpool
monster, threatens to be his end.</li>
<li><strong>Bards rock</strong>: bards, poets and singers are universally great. They bring the
people to tears, and generally speaking, survive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Answered questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>After sneezing, Russians sometimes say "truth". There is a passage related to
this, and I got curious. Does the Russian tradition come from the Greek?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Apparently</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vickrey">yes</a>.</li>
<li>Athena continually disguises as Mentor, a man in Odysseus entourage. Mentor is
also extremely wise and a great advisor to Telemachus. Is this the origin of
the word? <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Apparently yes</a></li>
<li>Are Phaeacian Phoenicians? There are similarities beyond their names, like
great skill in navigation. I answered this myself since eventually both
appeared in The Odyssey as distinct peoples. However there is some interesting
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/7299720/Homer_s_Phaeacians_and_Phoenician_Bi-lingual_Onomastica.docx">academic
writing</a>
on this: "The onomastic qualities of Phaeacian personal names in book 6-8 of
the Odyssey further indicate that the bard envisioned the Phaeacians as a
fantastical clone of the real-world Phoenicians." </li>
</ul>

<h2>Narrative observations</h2>

<p>The story itself was pretty clear, but I was super confused about Odysseus' side
trip to Hades. I had to read about it separately. The trip was just to talk to a
prophet in order to find out what to do next? Such a needless tangent.</p>

<p>There is some complex structure in the narrative. Big chunks of the story are
narrated by the actors themselves. Odysseus retells part of his story to King
Alcinous (Father of Nausicaa). Telemecus reveals a sparknotes version of The
Iliad when he visits Nestor.</p>

<p>One of the greatest scenes must have been Odysseus confronting the suitors as a
beggar in his own house. It's so vividly written, with great details including
Argos' death. This is apparently the only time the dog is ever mentioned, but it
makes the listener feel as if there's so much more to the story.</p>

<p>Although the narrator is clearly on Odysseus side, his decision to kill all of
the suitors was clearly disproportionate to their crimes. It's easy to imagine
Odysseus as a villan, triply so with the mass strangulation of slave girls that slept
with the suitors, and his vicious torture of Melanthius. </p>

<p>Is this really the end of Odysseus' adventures? As soon as he returns, he must
venture off again to appease Posideon. Sounds like another arduous journey, and
another decade of disappointment for Penelope. Her patience and the ambiguity
with which they reunite is palpable.</p>

    <title>The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/the-fifth-season-by-n-k-jemisin"/>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/the-fifth-season-by-n-k-jemisin</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The Fifth Season is a well crafted fantasy book, the first of the Broken Earth
trilogy. Each book in the trilogy won a Hugo Award in subsequent years, which is an
unprecedented achievement. But even more importantly, my wife discovered it and
recommended it to me! Overall, I found the book to be very original, but
had a few gripes too. The best parts were the slow reveal and the world
building, but I found the beginning to be boring, and struggled a bit with
identity politics.</p>

<p>Jemisin's world building is very compelling. She created an interesting,
completely original universe based on tectonic plates, the earth itself, and
seismic activity. The earth-like setting is incredibly seismically active, and
some humans have some ability to control this activity, either suppressing
shakes or creating their own. There are also humanoids that appear to be made of
rock, and other interesting fauna. I really liked kirkhusas for some reason. One of the
great things about the way the book is written is that all aspects of the world
reveal themselves very slowly. Two thirds of the way in, I was still confused
about the mechanics of earth manipulation, the politics of the realm, who the
characters really were. I also loved the way that that three distinct story
lines merged into two, then one. </p>

<p>Two aspects that I didn't like are as follows. Firstly, I found the sex towards
the end of the book to be surprising. The first encounter with Inon devolved
into a really a weird scene, and I felt that the whole book risked devolving
into smarmy rom. </p>

<p>Secondly, it is an underdog story that feels a bit too black and white. Those
that control the earth form an underclass, despite their great innate power.
They are subjugated by non-magical people that control them through their
evil, hierarchical bureaucracy. The author does a great job conveying emotions,
especially of the female characters. Their frequent frustration is palpable.</p>

<p>I really wish I didn’t know the identity of the author before reading. This was
inevitable, as her picture prominently features on the inside cover. As a
result, I was distracted by the emphasis on female protagonists and racial
analogies. Even the word "rogga" connotes very directly another racially
derogatory term that has no place on this page. In that political light, I was
somewhat surprised at the revolutionary tone the author sets, especially towards
the end of the book, and particularily in the cryptic ending. I suppose it's a
powerful hook to read the next book in the trilogy.</p>

    <title>Radical Markets by Posner and Weyl</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl"/>
    
    <updated>2019-04-18T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The book Radical Markets is centered on one central premise: **Competitive, free
markets are awesome, but most in reality are either not perfectly competitive,
or insufficiently free**.</p>

<p>Overall, the book covers a lot of ground, proposing solutions to many of
modernity's major questions, from immigration to monopolies to property rights.
I found the tone to be overly enthusiastic, and annoyingly focused on the word
"radical". Although the authors try to provide nuance sometimes, for example
emphasizing that they would like to see their ideas applied gradually and after
small scale testing, it still reads more like a manifesto or a series of
pamphlets than like a coherent book.</p>

<p>That said, I found that the "everything is a market" lens to be pretty
interesting. I disagree with most of the specific implementations that
the authors suggest, partly because they are so specific, partly because they
are so extreme. At the same time, I appreciate that they propose specific policy
rather than general platitudes. We live in interesting times, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton
window</a> is wider today than ever
in my lifetime. It is a good time to try to unbundle the author's ideas and find
the worthy nuggets.</p>

<h2>Auctions for everything, ever</h2>

<p>By the mid 20th century, Henry George was "by far the most famous American
economic writer", having written Progress and Poverty (1879), which sold
millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before
that time. The central idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">Georgism</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>while people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value
  derived from land (often including natural resources and natural opportunities)
  should belong equally to all members of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors take some Georgist ideas and try to apply them with the goal of
reducing inequality. For example, they claim that real estate is not a
competitive market. A particular property may be unique, and thus a sort of
micro-monopoly, despite other supply being available. The authors often cite
holdouts as common roadblocks for developing large infrastructural projects.
While the government could use its power of eminent domain, a private venture to
build a high speed rail line from Seattle to Vancouver would be impossible.</p>

<p>The authors propose a wealth tax on all property, in a form of
<a href="https://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/">Vickrey auctions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every citizen and especially corporation would self-assess the value of assets
  they possess, pay a roughly 7% tax on these values and be required to sell the
  assets to anyone willing to purchase them at this self-assessed price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A wealth tax is a <a href="/simulating-wealth-inequality/">great way to reduce
inequality</a>, but the authors bundle it together
with the above self-evaluation scheme. If you self-evaluate too low in order to
pay less in taxes, you may lose your property to a buyer that has found a great
deal. Conversely, if you self-evaluate too high in order to ensure that you
won't be bought out, you will pay more in taxes.</p>

<p>While this is pareto optimal, the obvious objection in practice is that it may
be rather annoying for residents of North Seattle to suddenly be bought up by
Jeff Bezos for his new private spaceport. I think I'd rather see a world in
which the government is more empowered to take on large public works, and more
agressively uses its power of eminent domain for the common good.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/beneficial-possible-profitable.png" alt="Possible/Profitable/Beneficial venn diagram" /></p>

<h2>A market for voting</h2>

<p>What if we treated voting like a market too? Imagine saving up your votes for an
issue you really care about. Why is it that we are so attached to the idea of
one person, one vote?</p>

<p>The authors criticize Likert scales for producing results that tend towards
extremes. This is interesting to me, since a lot of political surveys use likert
scales, as do many HCI studies. I'm a bit confused about this claim, since there
is evidence that likert responders have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-017-1344-2">central
tendency</a>.</p>

<p>Here again, the authors take multiple ideas and bundle them together into a
large package. They introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">Quadratic
Voting</a>, a collective decision
making procedure where participants can indicate how strongly they feel about an
issue.  Logistically, you are given a number of credits that you can allocate to
a set of issues. You can allocate multiple credits per issue if you care more
about it, but <code>votes = sqrt(credits)</code>. The authors found that this leads to a
more realistic breakdown of people's preferences, following what we'd expect: a
normal distribution.</p>

<p>The idea that you have a finite number of credits to allocate to some set of
issues entails trade-offs. To me this artificial scarcity is the main appeal of
the QV idea, since it mirrors finite resources of the real world. However, the
author's insistence that the dropoff should specifically quadratic seemed a bit
odd. Why not exponential? Why not a power other than two?  Maybe this is
discussed in more technical detail in another paper.</p>

<p>I'd love to see some sort of bounded credit allocation scheme used in more
surveys. Partly because this gives people a chance to do an initial allocation,
then think more about trade-offs. This reflects reality in a way to unbounded
surveys do not. The down side is that it's also a lot more annoying to do.</p>

<h2>Everybody gets an immigrant</h2>

<p>Large volumes of migration between countries is a relatively recent phenomenon.
That's because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modernity makes it easier to travel. Even if conditions in a country were
terrible (persecution or economically), it was very hard to leave.</li>
<li>There is a lot more economic inequality between countries. This started to
happen in the colonial era, and continues today.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of this increased movement, and the controversy that immigration has
caused in recent years, the authors propose a truly insane idea. What if
citizens could sponsor migrants from other countries in the same way that they
can sponsor family members? The authors flesh out what this might look like, and
even their own description paints an extremely precarious picture. Sponsor and
invitee would be matched through some kind of agency and meet over a series of
video chats. The sponsor would then be on the hook for finding housing, a job,
and guaranteeing the good behavior of their guest. In exchange, the sponsor
benefits from partaking in cultural exchange, and potential profit by
capitalizing on the guest's low salary. If the guest misbehaves, they are
expelled back to their home country, and their sponsor is reprimanded.</p>

<p>At the end of the discussion, the authors estimate that 1/3 of all Americans
would sponsor an immigrant through this program, based on the insane assumption
that every working age adult would want to participate. This is hilariously
optimistic. Just because something works for the Au Pair program which is very
small scale, specific, and in which the guest lives and works in your own home,
does not mean it will scale to full generality.</p>

<h2>Break up all the corporations</h2>

<p>Institutional investors like Vanguard and Blackrock have huge capital and can
invest in a whole sector, reducing competition within it. Specifically, authors
cite examples of multiple airlines serving the same route with funding from the
same investors causing inflated prices because of cartel-like behaviors.</p>

<p>The authors suggest to only allow institutional investors to invest in one
corporation per industry. but it's kind of unclear as to how to enforce this.
Defining which form is in which industry can be a real challenge. What is a tech
company even, and is "tech" a meaningful industry, or is Google just an ads
company?</p>

<p>I'm sympathetic to one idea that the authors write about, echoing Senator
Warren's recent demands for more government control over startups being acuired
by tech giants. These acquisitions lead to a concentration of power in large
companies, and ultimatley a tendency towards monopoly. The social empire that is
concentrated in Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram just gives too much data to one
corporation. In addition to providing consumers less choice, especially if the
acquired company's product is sunset, these acquisitions reduce competitive
pressure on the behemoth.</p>

<h2>Release the chains of data serfdom</h2>

<p>Advances in modern AI require mounds of human-created data. ML engineers at tech
companies transform this data into really impressive machine learning models. A
handful of research scientists develop new ML techniques. Only the engineers and
scientists get paid in the process.</p>

<p>In the chapter/pamphlet, the authors, citing Jaron Lanier heavily, argue that
the people that provide data should be adequately compensated. Traditional
statistics would argue that each data point has only a small marginal value. For
any given problem (eg. Face identification), each new labeled face provides
diminishing returns. The authors compellingly argue that many new ML problems
can be trained with the same labeled data, which makes the data itself more
valuable.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good argument, but the main challenge here seems to be
logistical: how do you decide how much to pay people for their data, and how do
you actually pay them? One problem with the idea of paying for all "data work"
is that a lot of user data is organically collected by people using a product,
not explicitly for the demands of a specific Machine Learning problem. If users
were to be asked for explicit data, that would be off-putting. As mentioned in
the book, having a paid contract emphasizes the idea that what you were already
doing for fun is actually work that deserves renumeration.</p>

<p>One thing skimped in the book is that it really depends on what the actual data
is. Google Translate is trained on human translations, which require substantial
translation skill by professional translators, who are very likely underpaid
today. It would make perfect sense for translators to receive commission from
tech companies for using their output to train translation models. In contrast,
face identification is trained on photographs of faces with labels around the
face, which anyone with a pulse can produce.</p>

<p>As an aside: I found the constant analogy between "women’s work", slavery and
serfdom to “data work” to be annoying and misleading. The authors love to
brandish loud colloquialisms like "techno feudalism" and "siren servers". I wish
they would stop! Unlike feudalism, Facebook is not a mandatory, all encompassing
system that controls your work and life. Unlike slavery, data work does not
capitalize at the expense of a specific identity group. Unlike "siren servers",
the lure of social networks can be resisted.</p>

    <title>Seeing Like a State by James Scott</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott"/>
    
    <updated>2019-03-28T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The most succinct version summary of Seeing Like a State this is what has been
called The Authoritarian High-Modernist <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Recipe for Failure</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at a complex and confusing reality</li>
<li>Fail to understand all the subtleties of how the complex reality works</li>
<li>Attribute that failure to the irrationality of what you are looking at,
rather than your own limitations</li>
<li>Come up with an idealized blank-slate vision of what that reality ought to
look like</li>
<li>Argue that the relative simplicity and platonic orderliness of the vision
represents rationality</li>
<li>Use authoritarian power to impose that vision, by demolishing the old reality
if necessary</li>
<li>Watch your rational Utopia fail horribly</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, humanity has clearly benefitted from modern institutions that
scale. Scale requires optimization. Optimization requires simplification.
But overly simplified schemes dehumanify people, converting humans into drones
lacking agency and autonomy. My main question going into this book: how to
strike the right balance?</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the book: Scott goes through many different examples of the
above scheme in practice.</p>

<h2>Scientific Forestry</h2>

<p>Pioneers of modern forestry viewed forests as factories for growing trees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"One should manage the forest so as to guarantee the highest sustained
  financial revenue, when all usable products are calculated in money." –
  Friedrich Wilhelm Pfeil, the first director of the Eberswald Academy of Forestry
  (1856)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led to the unintended consequence of forest dieback. A century later, an
observer wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of the pure stands [of spruce] grew excellently in the first generation
  but already showed an amazing retrogression [decline in yields] in the second
  generation.” – Richard Plochmann, District Chief of the Bavarian Forest Service
  (1968)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>City Planning</h2>

<p>Modern planners believed that city planning can be done abstractly, without any
regard for the specifics of the city's residents.  Le Corbusier's vantage point
is entirely external to the city, completely devoid of cultural context of the
people he was building for. The resulting city was perfect for an average human
that didn't exist. His plans were best seen from an airplane, and his sketches
entering the port on or ship. Le Corbusier's concerns are visual. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Houses are machines for living in." – Le Corbusier (1923)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led to planned cities like Brasilia and Chandigarh. These cities were
visually appealing from abstract vantage points, but not functionally livable.
They worked for people only because of an inevitable departure from the
architect's master plan, molding it to their actual needs.</p>

<p>One anecdote was particularly striking to me. Le Corbusier went so far as to
design plans for Moscow that were judged too radical by the Soviets. Unfazed, he
took the same plans and recycled them to use for central Paris!  In contrast,
Jane Jacobs in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, championed
function over form, and walked in the shoes of a resident of the city.</p>

<h2>Russian Revolution</h2>

<p>Lenin believed that communism must be brought in through violent revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the
  purpose of crushing the oppressors." - Lenin (1917)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He viewed the Vanguard Party as a machine for bringing on communism. Needless to
say, the revolution led to a huge loss of life, and then even more in the
repressions that followed. Conflicts with the Kulaks over collectivisation led
to a terrible decline in quality of life for farmers and workers that Lenin was
trying to help.</p>

<p>Rosa Luxemburg, a Marxist theorist and anti-war activist, and her spiritual
successor Alexandra Kollontai, a Russian Menshevik, had a very different take on
communism. Theirs was a nature-inspired view of social uprisings, strife, and
revolution. This bottom-up view was diametrically opposed to Lenin's top-down
view.</p>

<p>There are striking parallels with Jane Jacobs' critique of Le Corbusier.
Is it a coincidence that in both cases, it is a woman's humanistic, nuanced, and
intuitive tendencies criticizing the iron fisted absolution of a man?</p>

<h2>Agriculture</h2>

<p>Modern farming views the farm as a factory for producing food. The bigger and
more specialized, the better. This trend was present both in the west and in the
east in the early twentieth century, but it is illuminating to see the
differences in approach. This illustrates a point Scott hedges on repeatedly,
that high modernism by itself is not the problem, but requires authoritarianism
to lead to disastrous results.</p>

<p>In America, large industrial farms led to bad outcomes, but these did not lead
to massive famines or millions of deaths. In the east, the sheer scale of the
operation led to disaster. Early Kolhoz were created by dividing whole swaths of
Russia into a grid of 2500 hectare plots, and requiring quotas from each "farm"
without much regard for whether the land was arable or not. Collectivization in
the Soviet Union and China led to large scale famines and millions of deaths.</p>

<p>On the topic of agriculture, Scott explicitly mentioned one feedback loop I
found interesting. Crops were modified to make them more amenable to mechanized
picking. This led to a monoculture and a more fragile crop, and thus to
increased pesticide use.</p>

<h2>Applications to corporations</h2>

<p>One of the major ideas in the book is legibility, the process by which modern
states, over a long period of time, attempt to understand society, simplify it,
and make it more managable. In Scott's own words, to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of
  taxation, conscription, and prevention of rebellion.  Having begun to think in
  these terms, I began to see legibility as a central problem in statecraft. The
  pre-modern state was, in many crucial respects, particularly blind; it knew
  precious little about its subjects, their wealth, their landholdings and yields,
  their location, their very identity. It lacked anything like a detailed “map” of
  its terrain and its people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It struck me that a lot of Scott's critiques apply to corporations just as much
as they do to governments. In many cases, tech companies are in the business of
taking an existing practice and digitizing it.  Companies like Convoy and Cloud
Kitchens, in an attempt to digitize the physical, are implicitly increasing
legibility and imposing the same sorts of potential pitfalls that will be
described in this book.</p>

<p>In particular, this involves the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the physical world</li>
<li>Predict the future state of the physical world</li>
<li>Control the future state of the physical world</li>
</ol>

<p>This is exactly the same sequence of steps that most of the high modernist
examples in this book undertake.</p>

<h2>Recipes for success</h2>

<p>Scott has a few suggestions which I succinctly summarize "be humble". He
explicitly writes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take small steps, observe results, repeat.</li>
<li>Make sure the steps are reversible. The first rule of intelligent tinkering is
to save all the parts. (Aldo Leopold)</li>
<li>Plan for surprises.</li>
<li>Plan on human inventiveness. </li>
</ul>

<p>Scott uses "metis", a Greek word for know-how, or cunning, or chutzpah, to
describe a lot of what's missing in high modernist ideology. Metis refers to the
sorts of things that cannot be taught, but must be practiced, like riding a
bike, playing an instrument. Scott argues this understanding of the practical is
critical for any high modernist scheme, as the scheme is inevitably overly
simplifying, so gaps emerge that need to be filled.</p>

<p>Metis has led to folk discoveries that were done by non-scientific method were
often rediscovered by science in some form and formalized. Scott makes a sort of
prediction that this traditionally derived wisdom is still far ahead of
scientific discovery in some domains, such as poly-cropping for example.</p>

<p>One common theme across all of the high modernist failures is mechamorphism:
everything is a machine. For Le Corbusier, the house was a machine for living
in. For Lenin, the vanguard party was a machine for bringing forth communism.
For practitioners of Forstwissenschaft, forests were factories for making trees,
and farms are factories for making food. It's easy to make fun of, but maybe today's metaphors will be similarly flawed?</p>

<h2>Seeing Like a State and AI</h2>

<p>Speaking of today's metaphors...</p>

<p>In the spirit of Chesterton's Fence, it's worth taking a closer look at
simplifying schemes that we take for granted. They may actually have adverse
side effects. Can we undo them through a better understanding of the things
that came before them?</p>

<p>High modernism often fails because it is overly reductive. I keep wondering: can
we better understand complex, natural domains with modern technology? We've made
really great progress in some areas like speech recognition. Can we apply
AI to better understand complex domains without being overly reductive and
prescriptive? For example, what if we built a gardening AI to take meticulous
care of an organic polyculture farm?</p>

<p>Imagine a future in which a series of complex, domain-specialized AIs have been
created in such domains as gardening and driving. We may well end
up with systems that work super well, but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">far less legible</a>. What
would the ensuing world look like? I'm imagining self driving cars with emergent
swarming behaviors that look completely terrifying from the sky, but would be
very functional and completely safe (as long as no humans were involved in
driving decisions). I feel that we are very far from such a world, but it's fun
to think about.</p>

    <title>Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino"/>
    
    <updated>2019-02-22T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Calvino writes in some of the most poetic prose in my recent memory. At times it
borders on obscurity, but often it is beautiful almost beyond words.</p>

<p>Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan stories of the cities he's been to. A handful of
cities are each vividly described in a few paragraphs, and then we return to the
court, where Polo, diplomatic like a dragoman, tends to Khan's whims. </p>

<p>Are all of these cities metaphors for facets of a single city? Are the cities
real? Has Polo even been to them? Are Khan and Polo really communicating
non-verbally, in gestures and dances? Everything has an ethereal feel, and all
of the aforementioned questions are raised by the author himself, and all turn
out to be irrelevant. </p>

<p>At the same time, Calvino captures truths and conveys ideas with the emotional
valence that only good fiction writers can. All the while, the descriptions of
his cities are masterfully written, and incredibly imaginative. Some of my
highlights follow.</p>

<p>A familiar feeling when traveling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant
  that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in
  time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he
  had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the
  place of that man in that square.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another familiar feeling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to
  resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless
  dust cloud invades the continents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So imaginative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night,
  by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out
  on piles of carpets, at each word that one man says—such as “wolf,” “sister,”
  “hidden treasure,” “battle,” “scabies,” “lovers”—the others tell, each one, his
  tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that
  in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camel’s swaying
  or the junk’s rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your
  wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle
  other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at
  every solstice and at every equinox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And vivid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus the city repeats its life, identical, shifting up and down on its empty
  chessboard. The inhabitants repeat the same scenes, with the acton changed; they
  repeat the same speeches with variously combined accents; they open alternate
  mouths in identical yawns. Alone, among all the cities of the empire, Eutropia
  remains always the same. Mercury, god of the fickle, to whom the city is sacred,
  worked this ambiguous miracle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>High modernist failure mode (after a generation, residents of the planned city
Perinthia gradually turn into by monsters):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must
  admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to
  describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is
  reflected exactly in the city of monsters.</p>
</blockquote>

      <div>
        <p>In the grand scheme of things, the western world today is pretty great. To what
do we owe its prosperity? I got curious about this and realized that the answer
probably lies in the broader traditions of the anglosphere. I'd heard of the
Magna Carta, and even seen it, but what was the big deal? Anyway, in my quest to
understand, I came across this great series of lectures covering English history
from around the 9th to the 15th century. Paxton does a great job of bringing
life to what I've felt to be an often dry and confusing time and place. The
narrative is mostly chronological, but once in a while, she pauses and explores
an area in depth to great effect. I enjoyed the many cross-references the
lecturer made throughout the lecture, her etymological diversions, and lively
depictions of heroes and villans, and also references to popular culture (movies
mostly).</p>

<h2>English chronology, roughly speaking 900 - 1500</h2>

<p>(Imagine reading these in the style of Drunk History, I think it works best)</p>

<p>In the 8th century, England was split into seven kingdoms, each with its own
local lords. These kingdoms were loosely organized into counties called Shires,
each overseen by a Sheriff. This structure was originally military in nature,
each shire producing some quota of soldiers to fight on behalf of the local
lord. During this period, England was plagued by Danish invaders. Eventually,
all but Wessex came under Danish control, until the ruler of Wessex, Alfred the
Great, pushed back against the Danes and reconquered all of England. This didn't
last long though, and eventually the Danish and previous residents of England
melded into one people. However this was a troubled time, full of chaos and
internal strife and a lack of central control over the country. (TV show to
watch: The Last Kingdom)</p>

<p><strong>William the Conqueror</strong> was a Norman (ie. descended from Norwegians who had
conquered and settled in the north of France). After a series of failed kings,
England's succession was unclear. William crossed the channel and burned farms,
cutting off the food supply to London, and sieging it. Eventually William
controlled both Normandy and England. He effectively suppressed rebellion and
got the nobles on his side. English society eventually subsumed Norman culture.</p>

<p>William's succession story is very colorful. Upon his gruesome death, his eldest
son took England, while his middle son took Normandy. The eldest went on the
first crusade, leaving England on lease to his brother. Meanwhile, Henry, the
youngest of the three, got nothing. After his middle brother died in a hunting
accident, Henry came to control both Normandy and England. Upon his return from
crusade, Henry imprisoned his oldest brother for the rest of his life (30
years?!). As king, <strong>Henry I</strong> made many changes, instituted the exchequer post
and appointed officials based on merit rather than birth.</p>

<p>Henry I's only son drowned in a drunken boat party. In his stead, Henry I
favored his daughter Matilda who was married off to the Holy Roman Emperor. But
queens weren't exactly a thing yet, so a succession dispute led to **King
Steven** coming to power. Steven was and not a very kingly man, and not a very
effective king. Anarchy and a civil war in erupted in England over Steven's
legitimacy, with Matilda's vying to get Henry, her son from her second
marriage onto the throne. </p>

<p>Eventually she succeeded, and <strong>Henry II</strong>'s reign was focused on mending the
damage done by the civil war, reuniting England and Normandy, and restoring it
to grandpa William's glory. Henry II married Eleanor of Acquitaine, further
expanding his empire into France. Sadly his reign was undone by a conflict with
Thomas Beckett, formerly his right hand man, but now the archbishop of
Canterbury. When he had Beckett killed for disobedience, he became deeply
unpopular and Becket was canonized as a saint. (Movie: Beckett)</p>

<p>Henry II was succeeded by his son Richard I, know as <strong>Richard the Lionheart</strong>.
He was extremely popular for his military prowess, as well as patronage of arts
and literature, especially the new genre of Legends of King Arthur, and Courtly
Love. He went on the third pilgrimage, by which point Saladin had already
reconquered Jerusalem. But Richard succeeded in defeating Saladin at Acco, which
remained European controlled for a century. </p>

<p>Upon Richard's death, he was succeeded by brother John. <strong>King John</strong> was not a
good king, cruel, and petulant. John managed to lose all of England's holdings
in France. He alienated his barons to such a degree that many of them banded
together to impose a great charter (Magna Carta) on John, designed to curtail
his power. This included trial by a jury of peers, and also no extraordinary
taxation without cause. John got Pope Innocent to repudiate the Magna Carta. and
eventually many English lords sided with the French, backing prince Louis as the
English king. John's son Henry succeeded him, and managed to best Louis and
win support of the English nobles with the help of William Marshall. </p>

<p>Under <strong>Henry III</strong>, the baronial conflicts continued. The Magna Carta was
reinstated, but still Henry III and his barons had many disagreements.
Especially on the foreign policy front, Henry III had many strange and foolish
ideas, attempting to reconquer Poitu in France, to place his brother on the
Sicilian throne, and to prevent lords from going on crusade. Every time the king
asked for a concession, the barons would trade it for more political power.
Eventually this led to the Treaty of Oxford, which extended the Magna Carta,
giving barons more power to appoint councils and administrators to effectively
run the country. Henry accepts the treaty but then reneged with the support of
an invited arbitrator St. Louis, King of France. The barons rebelled and forced
his hand. Simon de Montfort, leader of the baronial revolt also formalized the
structure of the parliament (from parle) which was formerly entirely informally
called by the king when he wanted to raise money. Now the parliament would meet
regularly, and be composed of 2 knights from each shire, and 2 members from
specific boroughs, elected locally. This structure clearly precedes that of The
House.</p>

<p><strong>Edward I</strong>, Henry III's son, succeeded him, to a collective baronial relief.
He was much more level headed than his father. Edward went on crusade, just like
the legendary and much loved Richard I. Edward passed many reforms to the common
law. In my books, he is ultimately a villan. He passed an Edict which banned
Jews from England, which lasted for the next 350 years, until Cromwell allowed
their return in the 17th century. In the grand scheme, this may be a greater
travesty than the Spanish Inquisition!</p>

<p><strong>Edward II</strong> succeeded his well loved father, and had an unpopular reign. He
was accused of homosexuality because of his closeness with his nearest advisor,
Galston. The barons hated this so much, they successfully expelled Galston to
France five times, and eventually murdered him. The barons attempted to rise up
against the king, but their efforts were quashed. The rebellion's leader was
murdered as retribution without a trial, which didn't help Ed's popularity. Also
Edward II suffered humiliating defeat at the hands of Robert the Bruce in
Scotland. Ultimately he was deposed by his barons and placed in prison, where he
died, possibly by being disemboweled as punishment for his lifestyle choices.
His wife allied herself with the Barons, and succeeded in getting their son Ed
III to the throne.</p>

<p><strong>Edward III</strong> started his career as king under the thumb of his mother and her
lover. When he grew old enough, Ed III took over in a coup and took the reigns.
For a while he was also a legitimate heir to the French throne through his
mother's line. Ultimately he conquered a bunch of French lands, including Calais
in the north which was strategically important because it was the opposing port
to Dover and constituted the shortest crossing of the channel. Rodin's famous
sculpture of the six nobleman of Calais depicts a an event that actually
happened where Edward III picked out six noblemen of Calais to be hung for their
subordination, but conceded when his pregnant wife begged for mercy. Generally a
very successful Ed III is remembered fondly in contrast to his father.</p>

<p>To finance the Hundred Years War against France, Edward III introduced a tax
that affected everyone, even the poorest. Previously taxes only applied to
people that owned goods, effectively a wealth tax. This new head tax also rose
over time. Also, papal patronage meant the pope instated high ranking clergy
from Rome, barring local clergy. This is also the period of the Avignon
"Babylonian captivity", when popes moved from Rome to southern France. During
this Great Schism, there were sometimes 3 popes. I'd never heard of John
Wycliffe and his followers (known as Lollards) but he was a sort of proto-Martin
Luther, advocating similar reforms to Christian orthodoxy such as a direct
relationship with God and redistribution of church-owned land. He even produced
the Bible translated into vernacular English. This economic and clerical
dissatisfaction led to the Peasant Revolt of 1381, which was the first popular
(as opposed to Baronial) rebellion. It was eventually quelled but did
demonstrate that the king increasingly had to listen to the people. The head tax
was abolished. </p>

<p><strong>Richard II</strong> was the grandson of Edward III. Richard's reign was completely
dominated by what is called the Merciless Parliament, which strove to further
curtail the power of the king. In retaliation Richard the second banished many
of its members and denied inheritance to several opposing Lords. Eventually he
was deposed by a new parliament and died in a prison cell in 1400. He was
succeeded by Henry Bolingbrook, who came to reign as <strong>Henry IV</strong>.  He was the first
Lancaster of a long dynasty, eventually leading to the Tudors. His reign was
short, succeeded by his son <strong>Henry V</strong>. </p>

<p>Henry V's reign was highlighted by successful conquest in France during the
Hundred Years War, most notably, in the battle of Agincourt. This was largely
due to internal divisions in France, but it made Henry V a popular king. His son
and successor <strong>Henry VI</strong> managed to lose all of the English territories in
France.  By then, France was united again, and Henry VI had little interest in
ruling was mentally unstable. The only English territory in France that remained
was Calais, and England held it for the next century. </p>

<p>Henry VI's death led to a succession dispute between two houses: Lancaster (red
rose) and York (white rose), called the War of the Roses. At first York had the
upper hand. Its leader Ed IV held the reigns until his death, and was succeeded
by his son Edward V, a 12-year-old boy at the time. But his reign did not last
long. Vying for power, Ed V's uncle Richard, invented a lie saying that Ed was a
bastard. This led to a successful propaganda campaign in which Richard III
successfully usurped the throne. But it backfired as most people could see
through the lie. Richard III likely executed his young rivals in the Tower of
London, and he was reviled by the people, often depicted as a hunchback and of
short statue in retrospect. </p>

<p><strong>Henry Tudor</strong> was part of the Lancaster faction, and had a claim to the
throne.  His first attempt to take over was thwarted by King Richard III, and he
escaped to Bretagne in France. From there, he eventually amassed an army and met
Richard III in battle. Due to his unpopularity, Richard's armies did not obey
him at a critical moment. Henry Tudor was victorious, the War of the roses was
Won by the Lancasters, and thus begins the Tudor lineage, a long period of
English stability. To cement his position and end the civil war definitively,
Henry VII married Elizabeth of York. He and his son Henry VIII then
systematically eliminated all of the pretenders to the throne, and paved the way
for English supremacy during the Renaissance. </p>

<h2>Crazy etymological stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>The name Easter comes from the pagan holiday Eostre. The apple does not fall
far from the tree. </li>
<li>To liquidate comes from melting of coins and other metallic valuables. Obvious
in retrospect, never thought of it.</li>
<li>Tolkien's Shire and modern police Sheriffs both trace back to medieval
England.</li>
<li>A farthing comes from the word "fourth", because it's value is 1/4 of a penny.</li>
<li>The title Earl comes from Ealdorman, rooted in "elder". Crazy!</li>
<li>Chivalry comes from the French word for horse, cheval. Another obvious in
retrospect case.</li>
<li>Heraldry is the study of coats of arms. The connection to newspapers named The
Herald is present but convoluted.</li>
<li>The notion of bearing arms used to mean that you had a coat of arms, as an
indication of status. This sure has morphed over time for sure!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interesting thoughts and insights</h2>

<p>It remains unclear to me what role Thanes played in 9th century England. Did
they have several shires in their control?</p>

<p>The Domesday book is an impressively early systematic attempt to survey all of
England. It was conducted by William the Conqueror in 1080s. Damn impressive for
the time. </p>

<p>Apparently the switch from oxen to horses for agriculture happened from the 11th
to 13th centuries, with a surge in commerce. Farmers were no longer subsisting,
but producing extra, which would be sold at markets and fairs. Oxen are stronger
than horses, but do not make very good riding animals. A second order effect of
this switch was a change in the shape of farming fields. Previously, plots were
long and narrow since oxen were very hard to turn. Now plots were much more
variable in shape.</p>

<p>Paxton has a really great discussion on chivalry. This horse culture apparently
was the delineating line between yeomen and elites. Tournaments began as multi
person melee brawls and eventually morphed into formal affairs that we think of
today, with jousting. This tracks the evolution of knights, which were
originally hired mercenaries but ultimately became an upper class, sharing the
table with earls and kings. This upward mobility of knights was greatly enabled
by the church, when it condoned violence in the name of the crusades. Finally,
the culture of heroism and going on crusades had much cache. Vividly, Paxton
retells the story of a blind king of Bohemia charging into battle flanked by his
two companions. He wanted glory in death and found it in Calais. </p>

<p>Written English temporarily died after the Norman conquest, and was supplanted
by French. This lasted for a while, as the civic elite favored French and the
religious elite favored Latin. Eventually written English made a big return with
prominent works written in it including the Canterbury Tales, which interesting
are about a group of pilgrims making their way to see the Tomb of Thomas
Beckett. (Interestingly, French remained the Lingua Franca of Europe for a
while, with Russia and other latecomers clearly falling under French influence
as late as the 19th century.)</p>

<p>I think roughly speaking, society was ordered like this: serf (indentured
servant), then yeoman (small landowner), then gentry (artisans, merchants), then
knight, lord, and king. Rankings among the clergy still elude me, but an
interesting topic for future reading.</p>

<p>I was struck that many historical "events" lasted much longer than I would have
guessed. The three crusades spanned 3 centuries. The Black Plague ebbed and
flowed also over 3 centuries. This is of course easy to see in retrospect, but
it made me wonder what sorts of 3-century long historical events people of 2500
will remember about us?</p>

    <title>Real Estate and Cash Flow</title>

        <p>"What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow... And 36 Other
Key Financial Measures, Updated Edition"... What a title!</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm kind of embarrassed to post this here, especially so soon
after The New Father. But, I'll admit, I'm a bit spooked by the markets lately.
While indexing has worked well so far, it feels risky, and I'd probably be wise
to diversify. Hence this book.</p>

<p>The book makes two things crystal clear: </p>

<ol>
<li>"Investors don’t decide to buy properties; they decide to buy the income
streams of the properties."</li>
<li>The importance of discount rate in doing these various calculations, or as
the author usually descibes it, "the time value of money". A meta thought
about discount rate. It seems to be a proxy for selfishness. In the
self-interested case (maximize profit through real estate), you really want a
high discount rate, but in the long view, say thinking about climate change,
you think of future generations, and have a pretty low discount rate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, I liked the up-front breakdown of all of the ways in which being a
landlord may be profitable:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cash flow: "You expect to collect money, mainly in the form of rent."</li>
<li>Amortization: "You expect to spend money to pay for the operating expenses
and the loans against the property."</li>
<li>Tax shelter: "When you’re done for the year, you hope to have a surplus and
to keep as much of it as you can in your own pocket and out of the hands of
the tax collector."</li>
<li>Appreciation: "Perhaps someday you can also sell the property at a handsome
profit."</li>
</ol>

<p>If I end up attempting to purchase a real estate investment, the book will serve
as a good reference for calculating various terms of the industry (eg. APOD, Cap
rate, CFAT, etc). Honestly, this is really boring stuff, and pretty
straightforward from a calculation perspective. During the case studies
especially, the author meticulously grinds through the numbers, and I could feel
my eyes glazing over.</p>

<p>Oh, before I end this topic, here is an anti-recommendation to a similarly
titled, but much dumber "Rental Property Investing: how to invest in profitable
properties to rent and derive maximum profit from them". Complete drivel. Skip
it.</p>

        <p>My daughter Elichka is a year old! She's the best, let me show you a picture?
Actually no. Not on the internet.</p>

<p>This book was a trusty reference for me when things got a bit dicey. Rather
than reading daddy or mommy blogs (urgh), a quick look at the relevant age was
sometimes helpful in calming the nerves. I'd recommend it to a new father.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Junger disparages modern western life, and has a very fond attitude towards
traditional hunter-gatherer civilization.</p>

<p>"How do you become an adult in a society that doesn’t ask for sacrifice?" he
asks. "Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel
necessary," he asserts. Modernity provides affluence and safety, but it's
incompatible with freedom and equality. It's easy to spend a day in a modern
society while "surrounded by others and yet feel deeply, dangerously alone."
"As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide
tend to go up rather than down," Junger says. Modernity is fucked, Junger says,
without citing Rousseau. It just ain't natural. Without hardship, you don't
really <strong>need</strong> friends.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Tribal society, while not perfect, was, and let's be honest,
pretty fucking awesome! So awesome, in fact, that "a surprising number of
Americans—mostly men—wound up joining Indian society rather than staying in
their own." I found this surprising, and sadly, there was no citation. You don't
really need to be a hunter gatherer, though. You can just be from Soviet Russia
(this resonated): "Adversity often leads people to depend more on one another,
and that closeness can produce a kind of nostalgia for the hard times that even
civilians are susceptible to." Junger makes the distinction between family and
tribe explicitly: "Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same
as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything
collectively." I thought of the compania.</p>

<p>But even in shitty modernity, if the circumstances are dire enough, people can
still come together and act tribally:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Male Youth: "They drive too fast, get into fights, haze each other, play
sports, join fraternities, drink too much, and gamble with their lives in a
million idiotic ways."</p></li>
<li><p>War: "Emile Durkheim found that when European countries went to war, suicide
rates dropped."</p></li>
<li><p>Disaster: "social bonds were reinforced during disasters, and that people
overwhelmingly devoted their energies toward the good of the community rather
than just themselves."</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the US, soldiers risk a 20 percent chance of PTSD. "they return from wars
that are safer than those their fathers and grandfathers fought, and yet far
greater numbers of them wind up alienated and depressed. This is true even for
people who didn’t experience combat." Remarkably, in Israel, "Despite decades
of intermittent war, the Israel Defense Forces have by some measures a PTSD rate
as low as 1 percent."</p>

<p>Junger thinks that re-entry into American is so difficult because the military
is so close-knit, while modern life is so individualistic. "Soldiers experience
this tribal way of thinking at war, but when they come home they realize that
the tribe they were actually fighting for wasn’t their country, it was their
unit." Compounding the problem is the public's "thank you for your service,"
which rings hollow and reflects a distance from the war itself. Indeed, it's
an ocean away. Further, ever since Vietnam, much of the public has had a
principled disagreement with America's wars.</p>

<p>Junger wants to bring veterans and civilians closer together, to ease
re-integration. "More dignified might be to offer veterans all over the country
the use of their town hall every Veterans Day to speak freely about their
experience at war." Interesting start.</p>

<p>This struck a chord:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but
  frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral
  extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing,
  infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are
  mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nodding, I wondered: how disconnected am I? Why don't we go build a <a href="https://www.opensourceecology.org/">house or a
tractor</a>, or maybe learn the answers to some
of <a href="https://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/">these questions?</a></p>

    <title>12 Rules for Life</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>One of my rules for life is: listicles are always clickbait, even in book form.
There is a balance to be found between order and chaos. These rules are
Petersons take on where that balance should be. I come at this with a dislike
for Peterson. I first heard him on a Sam Harris podcast and he came off as a
deliberate obscutantist. Also, the pronouns debate seems like a foolish hill to
die on. But when I. told me that he respected Peterson's ideas, I decided to
give the book ago. Spoiler alert: I got through about a third.</p>

<p>Tidbits I found interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classical music is a good illustration of fat head distributions / Matthew's
law / Price's law / Zipf's law. There are not many prominent composers and few
of their pieces are performed on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The Yin-yang symbol is actually about chaos and order, masculinity and
femininity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of Peterson's book is super annoying. Why the emphasis on the dominance
hierarchy? Sure it exists but is it the most fundamental thing about human
existence? After they're also other aspects to life that may be more important?
Peterson's is a classic zero sum framing of life, explicitly so in some places.
Petersons take on the snake as a primordial enemy that coevolved with humans is
a classic just so story. He ties it into Mary and Christ too, for good measure.
It's not credible, but his ability to spin a story is impressive. </p>

<p>Peterson seems to be writing for an audience of very low self-esteem men. This
is a recipe book for escaping this rut, at worst by becoming a narcissistic
psychopath. By rule four, I'd had my fill and decided to cut my losses.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Neil Postman has strong opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 18th century was awesome. </li>
<li>Postmodernism is always, unequivocally bad. </li>
<li>You don't need typewriters or computers, paper and pen is good enough. </li>
<li>People are getting stupider and stupider. </li>
<li>Defeating straw man arguments is super fun. </li>
</ul>

<p>Postman cites many great thinkers in a way that is clearly erudite. However the
book is rather short and covers a lot of ground, making his name dropping quite
annoying. Rather than delivering deep points, Postman remains on the surface,
hinting at the existence of various philosophical ideas that he is intimately
familiar with. All this while struggling to structure a coherent narrative. </p>

<p>I found the book mostly useless. It's a shallow summary of some stuff I already
knew, and set forth an exaggerated technological pessimism that I, to some
extent, share. In my most charitable view, Postman's over exaggerated positions
were intended to provoke thought for some hypothetical starry eyed silicon
valley entrepreneurial techno-optimist. Unfortunately, Postman's position is so
extreme and arguments so cliched, I found myself rooting for the other side. </p>

        <p>I read and listened to a few <a href="/books">books</a> in 2018. My highlights include
speculative fiction stories from Chinese authors: <a href="/books/the-truth-of-fact-the-truth-of-feeling-by-ted-chiang/">Ted

enjoyed <a href="/books/player-of-games-by-iain-m-banks/">Player of Games</a> and <a href="/books/darkness-at-noon-by-arthur-koestler-audio/">Darkness

China</a>, another on the <a href="/books/living-the-french-revolution-audio/">French

<li>The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and

        <p>I've only just touched the tip of the Chinese Sci-Fi iceberg by reading <a href="/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/">Three
Body Problem</a>. So I picked up Infinite Planets, also translated by the same guy, Ken Liu.</p>

<p>Many of the stories were just too out there for me to fully enjoy. I'm not sure
if this is what's meant by "wuxia", but some had a sort of Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon feeling to them: extremely ephemeral, very unpredictable, hard to
understand. I really enjoyed many of the stories, though. Here are my favorites:</p>

<p><strong>The Fish of Lijiang</strong>: an endearing vignette of fast paced life placed on
pause. Opposites attract in a science fiction cliche kind of way. </p>

<p><strong>A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight</strong>: where does reality end and really good
simulation begin?  Emotionally driven, powerful storytelling. Interesting blend
of Chinese folklore with speculative far future robotics/AI. </p>

<p><strong>Night Journey of the Dragon Horse</strong>: Memorable sketch of a post apocalypse in
which a sentient robotic dragon horse awakens from a long slumber. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Time flows like a river, halting for no one. There is nothing in the world
  that can outlast time itself." </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Folding Beijing</strong>: Great concept, compelling story. Interesting take on
automation. Also, this served as my introduction to the cynical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve">Philips
Curve</a>. If I was to be picky, the
story felt a bit too directly critical of class divisions in modern China for my
taste.</p>

<p><strong>Taking Care of God</strong>: a parable for aging, intergenerational
misunderstandings, but on a civilizational level. Memorable and bittersweet.
Loved the special relativity explanation for the religious vs. scientific
understanding of Earth's age. Has this been done before?</p>

    <title>Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/bowling-alone-by-robert-putnam"/>
    
    <updated>2018-11-29T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/bowling-alone-by-robert-putnam</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This one's a doozie. I don't recommend it unless you are a naturally optimistic
and mentally stable person. I read Bowling Alone as part of my quest to understand
social capital. I'd heard of it before, but it came to my immediate attention
because it was referenced in <a href="/books/war-and-peace-and-war-by-peter-turchin/">War and Peace and War</a>.</p>

<p>Putnam's thesis is that by many measures, social capital in America increased
after World War II to its zenith in about 1960, and has been falling ever since.
(The book was written in 1999, but my suspicion is that downward slide has
continued into the oughts. It would be interesting to see an update.) Putnam
looks at a variety of indicators from a variety of surveys, mostly the General
Social Survey (GSS) and the DDB Needham Life Style archive. </p>

<p>Bowling Alone is long, dry, and somewhat repetitive. It's broken up into several
sections: 1) what's going on, 2) why is it happening, 3) why is it a bad thing,
and 4) as Lenin says, "what is to be done?". I skipped large chunks of (3) since
I'm already convinced that social capital is important and correlates strongly
to a bunch of important things that I'd like to keep having, as well as <a href="/books/war-and-peace-and-war-by-peter-turchin/">the
fall of empires</a>.</p>

<p>A bunch of charts and graphs that Putnam cites are <a href="http://download.audible.com/product_related_docs/BK_SANS_007716.pdf">worth perusing and available
here</a>.</p>

<h2>Social capital has been falling since 1960</h2>

<p>The following indicators followed the general pattern: peak in 1960, followed by
decline through at least 1999:</p>

<ul>
<li>Percentage of voters (PV) who worked for attended a political meeting.</li>
<li>PV who attended a public meeting for school or town affairs.</li>
<li>PV who served as an organizer for a local club/organization in the past year.</li>
<li>Number of club meetings attended per year.</li>
<li>Average weekly church attendenance.</li>
<li>Percent of labor force that is unionized.</li>
<li>Membership in professional organizations.</li>
<li>Frequency of whole family dinners.</li>
<li>Frequency of card playing.</li>
<li>Total giving by living individuals as a percentage of national income.</li>
<li>Percent who say "most people can be trusted".</li>
</ul>

<p>As Putnam diagnoses the problem, some striking trends stuck with me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trend towards social engagement under an umbrella of a church, and
increasingly, an employer.</li>
<li>Trend towards "privatized religion": belief without a specific congregation.
Non-organized religion gives personal meaning but no social capital.</li>
<li>Passive consumption up, active participation down. In sports, there are fewer
players but more viewers. In music, fewer players, more listeners.</li>
<li>Membership in organizations increasingly is a cheap way to indicate political
preference without dedicating substantial time or money to the cause. It's
also not social: most don't engage in person or discuss it with friends. </li>
<li>Depressing generational shift in what constitutes a good life and what
community means to people. More people want more money, and fewer care about
having a job that contributes to society. Patriotism wanes, materialism waxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as some concepts that were new to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bonding vs. bridging social capital: Bonding social capital is within a group
or community whereas bridging social capital is between social groups, social
class, race, religion, etc. According to Putnam, bonding social capital is
good for “getting by” and bridging is crucial for “getting ahead”.</li>
<li>Generalized reciprocity: gift giving without the expectation of an
immediate return, but with the vague understanding that someone will someday
return the favor.</li>
<li>Thick vs. thin social trust: very related to the above. Thick trust means you
trust a specific person for past deeds you know of personally, while thin
trust is akin to generalized social reciprocity where everyone in a community
is trusted by virtue of being a member.</li>
<li>Mahers vs. schmoozers (from Yiddish): Mahers invest time in social
organization, schmoozers: those who spend time in informal conversation.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of the section, Putnam's carefully hedges any predictions about the
internet, after a discussion about how wrong predictions about the telephone's
effect on social fabric were. This also serves as a sobering reminder that
social capital was well on the downswing by the advent of the internet. Thus,
Facebook or other oft-maligned internet-related entities cannot be the sole
cause.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A society characterized by generalized reciprocity is more efficient than a
  distrustful society, for the same reason that money is more efficient than
  barter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Because of TV, urban sprawl, working women, etc</h2>

<p>Putnam is explicit that he thinks many mostly weak factors have led to the
trends he's observed. But he outlines a few that seem to be the strongest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Women that are forced to work for financial reasons. This population seems to
have had the biggest drop in social capital. In contrast, women that work
part time by choice seem to be pulling social capital up. (~10% of cause.)</li>
<li>Suburbs, more car dependence, more time in cars, more cars per household.
Instead of living near work, restaurants, and shops, each facet of life is in
a different suburb. At the time of writing, the average american spent 72
minutes a day in cars, 70% of trips done alone. </li>
<li>Much of America's increasing free time has been channeled into watching TV.
Average American watches 3 hours a day. TV watching correlates strongly with
civic disengagement, especially non news watching, and channel surfing. (~25%
of cause.)</li>
<li>World War II was unique. The fact that it followed the great depression meant
that it had a leveling effect on most of society. In contrast, Korea and
Vietnam were both highlighted by social inequality in troop selection and
recruitment.</li>
<li>Controversial discussion about race as a cause of disengagement. Black % of
population has increased, but blacks actually are involved in more
organizations than whites, due to religious and race-based groups. But they
tend to be less trusting than whites (for good reason.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Putnam destroys the deterministic capitalism argument posed by Marxists, that
capitalism inherently is incompatible with social cohesion. Capitalism has been
a feature of American society for centuries while social capital has ebbed and
flowed. That said, increased globalization means there are fewer small
corporations with strong local ties.</p>

<p>Putnam makes many references to Alexis to Tocqueville, referring to him
colloquially as the patron saint of social capital. I was surprised to learn
that relative social capital levels throughout the states haven’t really changed
much since Tocqueville's travels in America in the 1830s. Generally speaking,
the more virulent slavery was, the lower the social capital. Areas high in
Scandinavian immigration, correlated strongly with high social capital. These
trends remain today.</p>

<h2>What to do? Look to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era</h2>

<p>Putnam draws analogies from today to the Gilded Age (1870s to about 1900). One
parallel is the way in which a surge of new technology disrupts social capital.
The advent of electricity, new mass media: the radio, a train network which
allowed much faster access to cities. The latter was especially important since
automation of strength was wreaking havoc in traditional rural life. More and
more jobs were to be found in urban factories. A centralization of companies
were named after their illustrious founders. And this all led to an increasing
gap in inequality. The analogies to today are clear: ubiquitous affordable air
travel, automation of menial intelligence threatening some jobs, the advent of
the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then as now, waves of immigration threaten the unum in our pluribus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Progressive Era (1890s to the 1920s) that followed, huge amount of
reforms were undertaken. The Progressive Movement was a big tent, considered the
only movement in the US that captured the whole population. It came as a
response to a huge amount of technological change during the Gilded Age.
Confusingly, there is no direct connection between the current Progressive
movement and its origins in the late 20th century. Here are some developments
that came around then: birth of unions, eight hour work week, birth of child
oriented groups, boy scouts, kindergardens, playgrounds, high schools.</p>

<p>(Clearly I should read more about the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era.)</p>

<p>(I should also look into Amitai Etzioni's work on communitarianism. Sounds like
he has some practical suggestions.)</p>

<p>(Bowling alone seeds an update. It would be nice to see the figures updated for
the last 25 years. A lot had changed: decline in real income, millennial
maturation, Gen Z emergence.)</p>

        <p>I picked up Shape of Tomorrow, its 35 cent price imbued proudly on the front
cover, on a foray to Powell’s books in Portland.</p>

<p>In 1958, the birth control pill wasn’t yet past clinical trials and TV watching
hadn’t yet become the dominant American hobby. What a time to be alive!</p>

<p>Soule takes care not to speculate too wildly, hedging often, but many
predictions are still downright comical. America’s increase in productivity is
going to reduce inequality. The work week is on the brink of shortening to
twenty four hours. Cool stories abound.</p>

<p>This was not a great read by any stretch. However, it is mercifully short. 
Safely skip the first half of the book, which excitedly enumerates unexciting
innovations of the day. That said, if you’re looking for a time capsule into the
technocratic mind of the 1950s, George Soule might just be the retro-futurist
you are looking for.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I've forgotten how this book appeared on my radar, but I think it was on
someone's list of most influential books ever. I am more ambivalent.</p>

<p>The book's subtitle is "Some Instructions on Writing and Life", and honestly I
was hoping for more of the latter. Unfortunately it was more of the former,
specifically how to write fiction, which is interesting in theory, but is not
something that is very high on my current list of things I would like to spend
my time doing.</p>

<p>In general, the author has some good tips for the fledgeling writer. These are
pretty intuitive, but do serve as good reminders:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with "shitty first drafts", revise later.</li>
<li>Write in small chunks as inspiration comes, as if looking through a tiny
picture frame.</li>
<li>Be wasteful with paper: don't worry about throwing out large chunks of what
you write.</li>
<li>Carry a notebook or index cards everywhere you go for when inspiration
strikes!</li>
</ul>

<p>More strategic and insightful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Observe the world and people for who they really are. Cultivate a sense of
"compassionate detachment" towards your characters.</li>
<li>Treat characters as if they have a mind of their own: “you probably won’t know
your characters until weeks or months after you’ve started working with them.
[...] Stay open to them. [...] Listen.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The book evoked a range of reactions in me. In the spirit of an open faced
compliment sandwich, I will start with the bad. A lot of Lamott's tips are
overly prescriptive, like that there is no need for hopeless novels, and no room
for an unreliable or unlikable narrator. I wonder how she and Dostoyevsky would
get along...</p>

<p>The author's tone is very California trustifarian. Attempts at black humor
are therefore diluted into a somewhat weaker grey humor. I think it makes the
book more accessible to a wider audience, but cheapened it in my eyes. In a
related vein, Lamott's progressive leftiness really shines through. There's this
hand wringing about western society being so broken and terrible. In a sense,
this is reassuring. The "we're in the dark ages and the president is Stalin"
sentiment is not a 2016 phenomenon, but had already emerged in 1994 when the
book was written.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I must say that a good chunk of the book put a smile on my
face. That chapter on Calling Around was really vivid and funny and
heartwarming. And she does produce some great visual metaphors, like these:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save;
they just stand there shining.”</li>
<li>Sometimes it feels... "as if writing a novel is like trying to level Mount
McKinley with a dentist's drill."</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I liked her stoic tendency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"My deepest belief is that to live as if we're dying can set us free. Dying
  people teach you to pay attention and to forgive and to not sweat the small
  things."</p>
  
  <p>"I heard a tape once in which an actor talked about finding God in the modern
  world and how, left to our own decides, we seek instead all the worldly things
  -- possessions, money, looks, and power -- because we think they will bring us
  fulfillment. But this turns out to be a joke because they are just props, and
  when we check out of this life, we have to give them all back to the great
  propmaster in the sky. "They're just on loan," he said,"they're not ours."</p>

    <title>The Fall and Rise of China (audio)</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Inspired by the Three Body Problem's best part, that is, the beginning of the
book set in Cultural Revolution China, I realized that I know nothing about
Chinese history. Perhaps, I thought, something like this might help? It's about
24 hours worth of material, and I took detailed notes in an attempt to retain it
better. The lectures are excellent, and I highly recommend listening. One
complaint was that I felt like the lecture lost a bit of steam and became
increasingly speculative as we approached the present day, but perhaps this is
inherent in any attempt to subject the recent past to a historical treatment.</p>

<h2>Before Communism</h2>

<p>Before the mid 19th century, China was largely isolated from the west. Chinese
society was modelled on Confucian ideals. The highest officials were selected
based on their ability to memorize profound lines from great teachings of
Confucius and his disciples. The entrance exam was known as the 8 legged essay
and super arcane. China called itself the Middle Kingdom, and was surrounded by
weaker states that paid it tribute. China had no equals, and submitted to
nobody.</p>

<p>The Manchu dynasty began its decline in the early 19th century, as a result of
population explosion, bad harvests, an opioid epidemic, and a trade deficit with
the west. Its exports of porcelain started to pale compared to cheap European
textiles flooding its market. (This is in some ways, an interesting reversal
from today's situation.)</p>

<p>China tried to curtail opium imports, and this led to the two Opium Wars with
Britain, who refused to stop the trade. China was badly outgunned by the west,
and stood no chance militarily. The Manchu dynasty continued to decline and made
successions to Britain, giving it a "small island" (Hong Kong) as part of the
military tribute. It wasn’t until the late 19th century that China had decided
to institute a foreign affairs department. Before that they only had a minister
of barbarians, whose occupants had notoriously short lived careers, lasting no
more than a year before being removed and punished for ineptitude.</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, China tried to modernize itself by sending its best
and brightest to study abroad in the west. The emphasis was on acquiring
military technology alone, while keeping Chinese traditions alive. This proved
futile, the lecturer suggesting that technology is a symptom of deeper
structures of European civilization like their government, economy, humanism,
and legal systems. This tension between European tech and Chinese tradition was
never fully resolved, and many powerful Chinese elite were opposed to anything
from the west (Mathematics? Ha!) despite their clear instrumental benefit. This
is in stark contrast with Japan that seemed to be able to reconcile its
traditions with modern technology.</p>

<p>The boxer rebellion in 1899 was a reactionary move against a loss of tradition
in China and increasing European influence. They were sponsored by the
xenophobic <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Empress Cixi</a> who took power in a coup. The boxers targeted a
German controlled area in China threatened 4000 europeans stationed there. In
retaliation a joint force of Japanese Russians and Europeans quashed the boxers
and killed many thousands, and led to nasty anti Chinese sentiment from the
German kaiser. Reparations were also imposed by the western victors. And China
returned to a conservative status quo.</p>

<h2>Seeds of revolution (Sun Yat-sen)</h2>

<p><a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Sun Yat-sen</a> was the first to integrate the need for Chinese self
determination without western intervention and the overthrow of the Manchu
dynasty. He came up with a three pronged platform: nationalism, democracy and
people's livelihood (land to the tiller). Later this became official policy of
Republic of China (Taiwan) and still remain credo of Nationalist party in
Taiwan. His reputation skyrocketed after a failed Chinese assassination attempt
in Europe. Gained many followers in the Chinese diaspora in America, France and
the rest of Europe. He organized multiple revolutionary uprisings in south
China. This encouraged over 200 peasant uprisings against the Manchu.</p>

<p>By 1910, Sun Yat-sen's relative was inaugurated as prime minister of the republic
(Kuomintang/KMT aka Guómíndǎng/GMD). He shared power with Yuan Shikai, a
conservative monarchist who declared himself Emperor. Yuan decided to
assassinate the PM and bribed the rest of the GMD to quit. Sun Yat-sen was
exiled to Japan, where he married again (interestingly, without divorcing his
existing wife). Meanwhile Yuan Sha Kai attempted to return China to 
traditional, Confucian values. He extended presidential terms to 10 years and
allowed him to name successors.</p>

<p>By WW1, the European powers were distracted by the war in Europe and
Japan decided to take advantage of the situation. Japan demanded extremely
unfavorable terms (21 demands) of China and Yuan Shikai had no ability to oppose
it. These demands were leaked to the public and a patriotic backlash ensued.
This eventually lead to Multiple Chinese provinces declaring secession. The
leader himself died unexpectedly, suspected poisoning. This led to a power
vacuum and an age of warlords ruling different parts of China. (The Good Earth
is a famous book about this period.)</p>

<p>After WW1 ended, European powers sided with Japan as thanks for its involvement
in the war against Germany. As a reward, parts of China were doled out to Japan.
This led to student and intellectual protests and ultimately sparked a golden
age in Chinese literature: colloquial and far more accessible books led to
increased literacy and spread of ideas. This included the works of Marx Engel
and Lenin.</p>

<h2>Early Chinese Communism and Mao vs. Chiang</h2>

<p>Communist reading groups started to show up, which is how <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Mao Zedong</a>
arrived to the scene. The Soviet Cominterm wanted to influence China and found
Sun Yat-sen willing to embrace their ideology and abandon his western facing
position (wow). In return he received soviet training and a bunch of
radicalized followers. <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Chiang Kai-shek</a> emerged from one of these
training camps as Sun Yat-sen's lieutenant. Sun died from liver cancer but the
party survived, with the right wing taking power.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek successfully united multiple Chinese contingents from the
communist party under a right wing platform and successfully took care of the
warlord problem with the help of the Soviets. Soon a left wing faction emerged
to oppose CKS's autocratic tendencies. CKS made pacts with European and mafia
leaders and ultimately abandoned communism as a key tenet of their platform,
thus departeing from Sun Yat-sen's anti imperialism. Chiang's forces conquered
Shanghai with their allies but the Communist left was not happy. This also
alienated the Soviet cominterm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mao and other communist leftists that splintered from CKS took control
of rural parts of China. Left wing communist rebellions known as Autumn Harvest
Uprisings were quashed by CKS nationalists. Mao wrote an essay that promoted
communism not through workers revolution but through an agrarian revolution.
This was frowned upon by the Soviets who expected industry to lead. Mao
established rules for Chinese Red Army soldiers that made them blend in with
villagers and farmers. By late 1928 Mao's forces were being forced to retreat
further but his political platform was maturing.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, Japan reformed, implemented western policies and retracted it's 21
demands. Still it's military thrived and Japan remained a threat to China, with
significant resource interests in Manchuria. The longer they waited the more
time CKS had to consolidate power and resist more effectively, and by 1931 Japan
controlled all of Manchuria in the NE and placed the son of Cixi as ruler of
that region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the south west, Maoists were another threat for Chiang Kai-shek.
Not willing to fight on two fronts, he decided to tackle the communists first,
letting Japan continue its expansions. Eventually Maoists were cornered
and had to retreat, starting the [Long March][lm], a retreat over 5,000 mi,
ending up in Yenan. In 1936 CKS wanted to pursue the Maoists again but the
general assigned to the task was a communist sympathizer and refused to comply,
since he wanted revenge on Japan. CKS confronted him near Yenan but was
kidnapped and coerced into alying with the communists to form a united front
against Japan, just in time for WW2.</p>

<p>(Interestingly the Chinese Communist Party came into its own as a result of the
Japanese invasion in WW2. This is somewhat analogous to the Soviet Communist
come to power after WW1.)</p>

<p>(Also interesting is that Stalin was forced to stop helping the Chinese and
withdraw because of the non-aggression pact with Hitler, and thus Japan.)</p>

<p>CKS was still busy chasing communists when Japan attacked, starting WW2. First
Japanese forces took Shanghai at huge GMD losses. Next was the massacre of
Nanjing which came at a huge civilian cost. Japanese commands pursued a scorched
earth policy against the civilians. This led to a deep popular resentment
against Japan. As the Chinese continue to struggle, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor
and forced US neutrality to end. Still the nationalists suffered huge losses at
the hands of the Japanese, their attention also divided by internal strife
against Maoists. Ultimately the CCP gained territory and influence while CKS
flirted with the US.</p>

<p>After Japan's defeat in 1945, America had hoped for a united Chinese government
and so tried to get Mao and Chiang and now to form a coalition. Diplomacy failed
out and instead they clashed in Manchuria. Just as Chiang Kai-shek planned to
take over Yenan again for the third time, Mao Zedong's PLA was amassing guerilla
forces to confront the nationalists in Manchuria, who were busy pushing back the
defeated Japanese and salvaging scrap metal from their former bases. Gaining
victory against ill prepared former warlords in the nationalist army, the PLA
proceeded to take Manchuria and marched west to capture Beijing, cross the
Yanzhee with the help of local ferrymen, and on to Shanghai. By 1949, Mao had
won, and Chiang fled to Taiwan. (I need a map of maos advance here, but the
article on the <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Chinese Civil War</a> probably covers most of the material
in more detail.)</p>

<h2>Mao's China</h2>

<p>The Chinese Communists made it very clear that they would side with Soviets not
the west, having been burned over the last decade by western influence. Mao has
a great quote about how there is only the two options and no middle ground.
(I failed to find it.) Meanwhile the policy of the CCP was to forgive those that
admitted to their mistakes but brutally punish those who did not. What followed
was a purge of nationalist and other non-believers characteristic of most
revolutions. Intellectuals were forced to go through an official process of
Thought Reform which included written confession. This may have been revised
multiple times until deemed sufficiently ernest.</p>

<p>When Mao visited Stalin in Moscow, Stalin showed his disdain for Mao and lack of
faith in Mao's ability to succeed. Stalin took a week to meet with him in
person. He gave Mao some loans earmarked for Russian military equipment, but
relatively small amounts compared to what he gave Eastern European allies. In
addition, the loans had to be repaid with 1% yearly interest. Stalin set up
joint stock companies in North China giving Russia partial control in industry.</p>

<p>In 1950 Joseph Stalin's and Chairman Mao's friendship was tested. The Korea’s
were at war. Initially Stalin backed Chairman Kim's North Korea against South
Korea. But when Truman decided to back South Korea he withdrew, seeking to avoid
direct confrontation. Eventually Mao assembled a volunteer army and pushed the
American troops back into South Korea. This back-and-forth lasted three years
and a total of 1 million Chinese died.</p>

<p>Domestically since 1950 China was destined to follow the Soviets, Also adopting
five-year plans, and forcing its peasantry into collective farming.
Collectivization basically failed due to the free rider problem, across the
board in all Soviet bloc countries. China was no exception. Mao also acquired
all private enterprises making them state owned. These reforms were celebrated
by senior communists at the 8th CCP congress in 1959, but Mao wasn't satisfied.</p>

<p>By then, Mao had been consolidating power in the party. He was now a larger
than life hero. At the same time, Khruschev dismantled Stalin's cult of
personality, and opened the Soviets up to the Chinese. The Soviets helped China open
aircraft factories and even shared plans for a nuclear weapon. Initially
friendly with Khruschev, relations went south when Mao was unsatisfied with
Khruschev's "revisionist" tendencies, especially enraged when Khrustchev
suggested that it was possible to achieve socialism through parliamentary means,
directly contradicting Lenin.</p>

<h3>Let one thousand flowers bloom (jk)</h3>

<p>To try to address shortcomings in the Chinese communist system, Mao decided to
"let one thousand flowers bloom". What this meant was that intellectuals we are
now free to express themselves however they wanted. Mao quickly changed his mind when
increasingly hostile letters started to be published against the Communist
system in China and against them chairman himself. In response, he began
systematic purges for dissenting intellectuals. It remains unclear whether this
was deliberate provocation. As a result, Mao revised his initial invitation to
intellectuals: your art writing and work in general should serve the
proletariat. Mao wanted to distinguish good thinking "flowers" from bad thinking
sabotage he called "weeds".</p>

<h3>Great Leap Forward (jk)</h3>

<p>To accelerate the advent of communism in 1959 Mao instituted the "Great Leap
Forward", which included many different reforms, Most of which had no experts
overseeing them. By 1962 it was clear that most had failed spectacularly, and
with tragic consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>To out compete great Britain in steel production, peasants built backyard
furnaces to melt down their metal. "Металлолом". The resulting iron and was of
low-quality and so useless.</li>
<li>A war against nature was declared. Large water management projects were
attempted but many ultimately failed. [One dam][banqiao] that was constructed
in this period, collapsed during rainy season and 200,000 people died (!).</li>
<li>Misguided attempts to control pests were instituted. Millions of Sparrows were
killed by peasants. But this led to an overpopulation of mosquitoes and other
harmful bugs.</li>
<li>New policies forced farms to collectivize much quicker than initially planned
and into much larger collectives of 20000 each. The larger the collective the
less incentive for each individual to work. Production dropped but ideological
fervor skyrocketed. Mid-level managers reported record food growth and
increased quotas, as well as grain exports to the Soviets. 30 million farmers
died in the famine that ensued.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile Mao himself was oblivious to any problem. He was getting busy with
young peasant girls during his village visits. But his party took note of the
problems. One party member, Peng Dehuai, was purged for his direct disagreement
with Mao's Great Leap Forward. Two senior party members, [Liu Shaoqi][liu] and
[Deng Xiaoping][deng] took the reigns for a time and took to a more calculated
strategy, quietly undoing the Great Leap Forward. Needless to say Mao was not
happy and began labeling everyone opposing him "mini-Khruschevs" and
revisionists.</p>

<h3>Cultural Revolution</h3>

<p>(Find the subversive painting with three red flags and silhouettes of Mao and
Stalin in the background. Also more about the three family village writing
group.)</p>

<p>Mao now had to deal with more backlash against his policies during the Great
Leap Forward. He retreated to his villa in Guangzhou and set his propagandists
to work. Impressionable students prone to extreme thought were an easy target.
Mao's new sycophantic defense mister compiled a book of Mao quotes. Known as the
famous Little Red Book, it became the basis for a new socialist education
program. Leftist ideologues spurred on students calling themselves Red Guards,
wearing green military uniforms, armed with the Little Red Book to commit
violence against dissenting professors and fellow students in the name of
ideological purity and conformity with Mao’s thought. Liu and Deng issued
bureaucratic investigations into the worst offenders, but when Mao returned,
he allowed the students to rebel against those "in power" whenever they wanted
as long as they were aligned with his ideology. This cart Blanche also
prevented the army from intervening in any way, to such an extent that brazen
students raided PLA warehouses and pilfered weapons. Student groups competed
with one another for purity, with those descended from intellectuals trying to
prove that they too can be good ideologues despite their “low” birth. Now armed
with modern weapons, they clashed violently with other factions. Mao fanned the
flames by closing down schools and universities for months, meeting with heads
of Red Guard factions, and becoming an honorary member. This student led fervor
began expanding into the general population, and soon the workplace was
similarly violent, unproductive, dysfunctional.</p>

<p>(The far left's tendency to fight and demonize and generalize against those in
positions of power is unchanged.)</p>

<p><a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Jiang Qing</a> was Mao’s fourth wife and also known as Madame Mao. She was
formerly a B movie actress, but now had political ambitions of her own. One of
the terms of their marriage was that she could not hold political office.
Instead, she began a concerted effort to heavily censor all media behind the
scenes. Everything was banned by default. The only content available to the
Chinese people had to be in service of the leftist communist ideal. Only 8
operas were allowed to run, all new and revolutionary. Women were forbidden to
wear jewelry, a strict plain-military dress code was effectively forced on all.
Madame Mao herself resided in her villa, banned works hanging on her walls,
decorated in jewlery, enjoying luxuries from the west.</p>

<p>As violence of the Cultural Revolution escalated, even the Chairman himself could
not curtail it through his direct pleas. Finally, he lifted the army’s ban on
intervention and the PLA quickly and violently quashed the student rebels. To
solve the student problem, Mao invented the <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Countryside Movement</a> which
conveniently involved shipping 17 million students to learn the way of the
village as an antidote to bourgeoisie thought. Tho rusticated and "educated"
students became known as the Lost Generation since they never received a modern
education and were unable to move back to cities until much later.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union and US relations</h3>

<p>In 1969, tensions between China and the Soviet Union were peaking. China had
recently demonstrated her nuclear capabilities in a small scale test. Meanwhile,
Brezhnev had outlined a new, more aggressive Soviet foreign policy, the Brezhnev
doctrine, which stated that the when a socialist country becomes more
capitalistic, other socialist countries should intervene. This happened in
Czechoslovakia, which set a dangerous precedent for Soviet intervention in
China. In addition to the two countries were vying for leadership of the eastern
bloc. China was completely outclassed in this regard having had several orders
of magnitude less money to spend on the cause.</p>

<p>Nervous about China's access to nuclear weapons, the Soviets were amassing
troops along the Sino-Soviet border. Meanwhile Mao decided to take advantage of
the opportunity and began playing off the Soviets against the Americans. Nixon
and Kissinger were interested in having disunity among the Communist bloc, so
allying with China, the weaker of the two potential leaders made sense as a way
to counteract Soviet power and aggression. To kick off detente, the American
national ping-pong team visited China. Although they were crushed by the
Chinese, the players built up a friendly rapport. This was publicized on TV,
which led to a warming of relations. Ultimately the culmination of this phase
was Nixon’s own visit to China. This was not without tension on both sides. Some
hard-core leftists are opposed to Mao's sudden change of heart. In America many
were still loyal to Taiwan and Chiang Kai-shek as the only China that’s valid
and were opposed to warming relations with any communist country. Interestingly,
China only joined the UN and became a member of the security council in 1971.
Previously the only China in the UN was Taiwan.</p>

<p>US China relations got stuck for a while and actually were set back by Nixon’s
Watergate scandal. His successor President Ford was largely ineffectual in
general. It wasn’t until President Carter when in 1978 US China relations began
to normalize in earnest. Many reasons why this happened, one is was the return
of Deng Xiaoping, who was unequivocally a reformer and not bound by Mel’s shadow.
Another was the growing hostility between the US and Soviet and a change of
heart in there a balance of power between the two superpowers. It is now clear
that the US sided with China as the underdog in order to weaken the Soviet bloc.</p>

<h3>Mao's successor and the Gang of Four</h3>

<p>By 1970 Mao is getting old and frail, and the CCP needed a successor. He
originally designated <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Lee Biao</a>, a fervent leftist. But he was opposed to
thawing relations with the American imperialists and was removed in an airplane
"accident". Mao also had designs for Ding Xiaoping, by now a very experienced
and proven administrator. But Madame Mao and her "Shanghai Clique" was opposed
and undermined his rise because he was too pragmatic and not ideological enough,
and was well known for pulling back some of the reforms during the great leap
forward. Another candidate, the premier [Zhou Enlai][zhou] was credited with
thawing US-China relations and received great press around the world. This
triggered Mao's jealousy. Zhou was subjected to struggle sessions courtesy of
Madame Mao. He died in 1976 from a cancer that Mao refused to treat with western
medicine. Chinese citizens were prohibited from paying him regards by Madame
Mao, but thousands did anyway, some writing angry notes comparing her to the
Dowager Cixi. Madame Mao had the protesters removed with force, and then used
the opportunity to blame Ding Xiaoping for the protests. She made an appointment
to see her ailing husband, who signed off on a request to remove him from his
political and military posts.</p>

<p>Finally, Mao had a specific heir apparent selected in his will “with you in
power I rest easy”, an unknown CCP member [Hua Guofeng][hua]. Madame Mao
attempted to alter Mao's will to write herself in instead. Upon Mao's death, a
coalition of moderate CCP members discovered this and put Madame Mao and her
henchmen under arrest.  They were called the Gang of Four. Meanwhile Hua
Guoattempted to ride on Mao's coattails and milk Mao's high praise for
everything it could offer. Still, he quietly began undoing leftist trends and
modernizing the country: </p>

<ul>
<li>Admissions into college were no longer political but based on
standardized tests. </li>
<li>Once called revisionist by Mao, he introduced incentive-based wage systems to
reward performance.</li>
<li>He opened up to china's intellectuals. Called for spirited discussions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As various leftist policies were being undone, all prior ills were blamed on the
Gang of Four. This became the scapegoat for the Chinese people as they dealt
with the cognitive dissonance of such a quick shift in thinking.</p>

<p>Deng Xiaoping managed to get back to power patiently and strategically. It
helped that his predecessor was not charismatic, deferring too much to Mao. He
was ridiculed for his unquestioning attitude: "whatever Mao said we will say and
whatever Mao did we will do" became derisively known as the <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Two
Whatevers</a>. Deng slowly took over, eventually holding high ranks
across the party's bureaucracy, as well as the informal but influential position
of Paramount Leader.</p>

<h3>Deng's reforms</h3>

<p>Deng continued in the same vein as Hua, but his reforms were even more
progressive and western facing. Suddenly the Chinese people gained a lot more
economic freedom. Small businesses were allowed to thrive and compete with
government entities. Special economic zones were designated. Personal rewards
were granted to reward high performing employees, the result of which was an
increase in productivity across-the-board.</p>

<p>Some attempts were also made to reform the political system and institute some
western policies. This led to an increase in dissent and opposing voices.
Ultimately Deng decided to roll back many political changes he originally
proposed. (I found it interesting to learn about the Paramount Leader being so
open to clearly changing his mind, without much protestation from the public.)
In his own words, he "crossed the river by feeling the stones", trying new
ideas, and sticking to them only if they work.</p>

<p>Although he departed significantly from Mao's doctrine, Deng was very
careful to not fully blame Mao for all of the shortcomings of the previous
decades. </p>

<h3>The late 80s</h3>

<p>By the late 80s, the success of various policies began to yield diminishing
returns. Many of the formerly prosperous village dwellers suddenly found that
their salaries were declining and were forced to migrate back in the cities.
This was also a time of huge corruption within the party, and inequality
skyrocketed. This led to student unrest and ultimately the demonstration in
Tiananmen Square.</p>

<p>Many reformist ideas were floating around but no new ones really got
implemented. Deng Xiaoping was deterred from giving in to too many liberal
demands, citing the events of Poland as an example to avoid. Poland was inching
towards capitalism as a result of a weak government that was giving in to too
many popular demands. And so, Deng Xiaoping walked a fine line. He wanted his
reforms to stick but also wanted to ensure that there was order.  During Deng's
tenure as Paramount Leader, he appointed various high level positions who were
officially in charge, yet Deng retained higher level control throughout.  This
also enabled him to retain a balance of power between western oriented reformers
and Mao oriented conservatives.</p>

<p>It was a turbulent time for international communism. East Germany fell quickly
follower by the Soviet Union. By 1989 the conservative left was starting to
gather steam and attempted to turn back Deng's western facing reforms. At 84,
and fighting for his life, Deng embarked on a southern tour, visiting special
economic zones and offering congratulations to a booming economy as well as
warnings about a leftist threat that might undo it all. In a tense few weeks, as
his health was ailing and the bureaucrats were vying for power, the tour wasn't
even publicized by the state run media. Eventually Deng emerged victorious and
the politburo officially declared that the left posed a higher threat to
China than did the right. </p>

<p>Deng successfully divorced markets from capitalism, and encouraged economic
reform while slowing political reform, in a gamble where he bet that Chinese
people cared more about their material wealth than their political freedom. </p>

<p>Meanwhile during the "roaring 90s", GDP doubled, foreign investment increased
7x, coastal cities and stock market exchanges flourished. Meanwhile the farmers
and country dwellers suffered. Eventually the uncontrolled market blew up and
consumer goods increased in price 15x. As many as 100 million peasants moved to
cities. Corruption soared: party members and cadres were immune to prosecution,
as was the army which managed to get half its revenue from market investments. A
spiritual crisis loomed for the youth and an economic crisis for the elderly.
This was the origin of "Free Tibet" and the Falun Gong as well. <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Jiang
Zemin</a> was appointed to be the General Secretary and promptly made many
moderating changes, introducing economic regulations and also joining the WTO
which is widely lauded as a big reason for China's Economic Miracle. Deng
Xiaoping died in 1996, aged 92 from Parkinson's.</p>

<p>With the economic changes came an increase in Chinese nationalism. Things seem
to escalate with the US but the two countries were able to maintain good
relations. In terms of greater China, Hong Kong transitioned peacefully 
in 1997 as per the British contract dating back to the Opium wars. 
Taiwan is a different, more complicated story. Chiang Kai-shek's son took over
for him when he died, and continued center-right politics. More recently, a rift
has formed between ethnic Chinese who fled the communists from the mainland and
ethnic Taiwanese. An ethnic Taiwanese president succeeded the GMD and pushed for
independence but the US, fearing war with Chana succeeded in reigning in his
idealism. The issue remains unresolved.</p>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>

<p>Holy moly, this is quite a long summary. I sure hope that writing it helps
me remember better...  Anyways, where was I? Ah yes, during the last few
segments, the lecturer continues on to discuss some specific issues in modern
China: the Internet, the Beijing Olympics of 2008. He highlights a spotty human
rights record, as well as Chinese monetary support for a wide variety of odious
regimes including Zimbabwe and Syria.</p>

<p>Overall a great introduction to modern China. Check it out.</p>
