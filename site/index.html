      <p>This site is statically generated with <a href="https://github.com/borismus/lightning">Lightning</a>, a
blogging engine I wrote. The basic idea is that I write all of my
content like this:</p>

<pre><code>About this site
===============

This site is statically generated with [Lightning][lightning]
</code></pre>

<p>Then a script converts it into the HTML/CSS that you are reading now.</p>

<p>There are many such projects, (eg. <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>,
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>). This approach provides clear advantages over a
traditional database-based blog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use any editor you like.</li>
<li>Use Markdown for structured text.</li>
<li>No worries about database management and security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lightning</h2>

<p>I wrote Lightning to scratch some specific itches (which may or may not
have been addressed in other similar projects by the time you read
this):</p>

<ul>
<li>Incremental builds (only rebuild what changed).</li>
<li>Quick deployment.</li>
