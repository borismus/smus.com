    <div class='body'>
      <p>Over this last year and a half, I spent a lot of time in airports,
flying nearly 150,000 km (queue environmental angst). I lived in Europe
and both coasts of the US, somehow getting a masters from CMU in the
end. For posterity, I wanted to digitally summarize this extensive
globetrotting experience, but found no adequate applications. It was an
experience worth celebrating, and how better to celebrate than by
writing some code...? So I wrote <a href="http://thattrip.appspot.com/">an application demo</a> that renders
travel adventures as a tour in Google Earth. </p>
<p>First you fill in a pretty silly madlib describing your trip: </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="madlib.png" /> </p>
<p>Then, you can view your trip in the browser using the <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/plugin.html">Google Earth
plugin</a>, or download the tour and open it in the Google Earth
application. Each trip gets a unique URL that can be shared with others.
Here is a youtubified summary of my recent travels generated by this
app:</p>

  allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The madlib provides a list of places and transportation modes, the
places resolving to (lat, long) coordinates, and the transportation
modes affecting the transition effects between places. Airplane
transitions are shown with the camera oriented north, in a bird's eye
view, while ground transport transitions are more complex, facing in the
direction of travel and changing pitch angle. The application builds KML
in JavaScript and eventually loads it all in a Google Earth plugin:</p>
<pre><code>// Build the KML
var helper = new KMLHelper();
helper.processData(data.places, function() {
  // Generate KML tour for this
  data.kml = helper.kml();
  data.distance = helper.distance();

  var json = JSON.stringify(data);
  // Save the new data to the database
  $.ajax({...})
});

// Eventually render the KML (ge is a Google Earth instance)
$.getJSON('/trips/' + id + '/', function(data) {
  var kmlObject = ge.parseKml(data.kml);
  ge.getFeatures().appendChild(kmlObject);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Place-to-place transition effects are achieved by using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/touring.html">KML Tours</a>,
which provide powerful camera control requiring some computation, like
getting the midpoint between (lat, long) pairs. Math for midpoint and
other common geodesy operations are <a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">well documented</a> by Chris Veness,
who also provides an implementation in the form of a
<a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlon.js">handy JavaScript library</a>. </p>
<p>In addition to destinations, travel paths and transitions, this demo
uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/overview.html">picasaweb API</a> to get public picasaweb images as
GroundOverlays near places you visited. While it's possible to get a
user's photos tagged with a tag, there is, rather bizarrely, no way to
get a specific user's images tagged with a given location. </p>
<p>As usual, all of the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/borismus/That-Trip">the github</a>. It's running
live on <a href="http://thattrip.appspot.com/">thattrip.appspot.com</a>, so try it out.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>The Google Earth plugin provides what is probably the richest map view
available on the web, but it is not without drawbacks. The mere fact
that it's a plugin immediately shrinks the possible user base of any app
that relies it and adds to load time. There's no way to pre-cache the
data that will be shown on a tour, causing a lot of chunky terrain
during quick transitions. While KML is rich and makes it possible to
embed images as ground and photo overlays, the web at large has far more
options to handle images, through CSS transformations and animations or
by embedding in a canvas or SVG element. </p>
<p>This demo is very geo-centric, telling a story almost exclusively about
where you went, with the images added as an afterthought. In retrospect,
a more compelling story is one about what you personally saw, shown in
travel photos, with a geodesy cherry on top. Stay tuned for future
work...</p>
