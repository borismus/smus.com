      <p>I wrote a short book about the Web Audio API. The book is meant as an
introduction to the web audio API, as well as some audio basics for web
developers with little audio experience. It is <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/">available for free on
Chimera</a>, a web-based book viewer, which presents a nicely laid
out page and lets you leave per-paragraph comments. The online version
also includes inline samples from <a href="http://webaudioapi.com">webaudioapi.com</a>. If you don't
like reading on the web, you can also <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025948.do">buy a physical copy or an
ebook</a> from O'Reilly.</p>

<p>So I got this cool bat on the cover. I am told that technically
speaking, it is a brown long-eared bat (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_long-eared_bat">Plecotus auritus</a>). Though
it's no orca (an ideal O'Reilly cover, don't you think?), I'm very happy
that it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation">sound related animal</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/webaudio-book/cover.jpg" alt="Web Audio Book Cover" /></p>

<p>The book was written on my laptop in a Google Doc. I hand-drew some
illustrations in a notebook and brought them into the doc. Once I was
ready for feedback, I sent the doc around to my technical reviewers, who
left feedback in comments. After incorporating their feedback, I got
some editorial feedback, still in the doc. Once the draft was more or
less ready to go, I created an <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a> task to convert the Google
Doc into docbook.xml format. The contractor did a great job and charged
me about $100. This was my first time paying anyone to do work for me.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of the reviewers, editors, illustrators and organizers for
helping. Also, thanks to <a href="http://www.kevincennis.com/">Kevin Ennis</a> who kindly donated the
<a href="http://webaudioapi.com">webaudioapi.com</a> domain which I'm currently using to host the
samples.</p>
