      <p>Since May, I’ve been tinkering with brushless electrical motors, trying to make floating objects move more quickly. The proximate result is this electric motorized paddleboard:</p>

<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9BbHWMzhPdxekJZf7"><img src="/esup-builders/esup.gif" alt="Riding my DIY eSUP" /></a></p>

<p>This project is by no means finished. Traveling at 5 mph is fun, but not nearly fast enough. As we speak, a motor ten times the power of this one is sitting in a shipping container, en route to my basement. While I wait, let me pause and reflect on the project so far.</p>

<p>This summer I’ve been spending more time on the water. Sailing and stand-up paddling are great escapes from a sometimes monotonous routine. As a result, I’m slowly forgetting luxuries I once took for granted: work trips, visits to Vancouver, vacations to faraway lands.</p>

<p>After my forced sailing hiatus, I needed to find another way to get out on the water. SUPing was great fun, but a bit repetitive, and frustrating in even light headwind. Driven by the need for speed, I found <a href="http://efoil.builders/">efoil.builders</a>. They are a community of crazy European kids building electric hydrofoils that scream above the surface of the water at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to strange electric vehicles, but I certainly was when it came to high voltage and high current. When my Solowheel broke down last year and I was unable to fix it on my own, I donated it to an acquaintance who promptly replaced the battery and brought it into tip-top shape. It took him no time at all, but I had no idea where to begin.</p>

<p>Happily, the last few months have presented many opportunities for electrical work around the house. I installed a ceiling fan in our bedroom and a window AC in my daughter’s. I wired up and installed new outlets in the basement. These are not glamorous achievements, just small victories that slightly reduced my fear of electricity.</p>

<h1>Building for …</h1>

<p>There is something very satisfying about creating physical objects with your own hands. In these strange times, I find this to be one of my most comforting escapes.</p>

<p>If the resulting object is of value to you or others, so much the better. <a href="/toddler-music-box">Building for my daughter</a> takes the cake, especially when she appreciates the results. <a href="/little-free-library">Building for the community</a> is also gratifying and surprising. Sometimes you just build to learn. This time, I’m building for myself. And in this case, a big part of the challenge will be learning to ride the damn thing. I think I’m up for the challenge!</p>

<p>Realizing that I’m dealing with a completely new domain, and my chance of failure is high, I decided to start small. The first milestone was to create some sort of vessel from a plastic IKEA bin (max 30A, 11V, 5000 RPM, 3cm prop). Having proved the concept, I moved on to something that would support my weight, and substantially larger components (60A, 22V, 1000 RPM, 15cm prop).</p>

<p>Let me conclude with a parts list for both builds.</p>

<h1>Tropfast components</h1>

<p>As you can see, this is not a seaworthy vessel.</p>

<h1>Shared components</h1>

<p>As you can see, both vessels have a lot of component types in common. So much so that I simply reused some of the same parts in both projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VE3QC7C">Flysky FS-GT2E</a></li>
<li>Charger: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QRQT3LC">Haisito 80W 6A Balance Charger</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I plan to write up a technical summary of what I learned in the process. Stay tuned.</p>
