      <p>VR on the web threatens to cleave the web platform in twain, like mobile
did before it. The solution then and the solution now is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web
Design</a>, which websites to scale well for all form factors.
Similarly, for VR to succeed on the web, we need to figure out how to
make VR experiences that work both in any VR headset, and also without a
VR headset at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate</a> is a new starting point for building
responsive web VR experiences that work on popular VR headsets and
degrace gracefully on other platforms. Check out a couple of demos, <a href="http://borismus.github.io/webvr-boilerplate/">a
simple one</a> and one <a href="http://borismus.github.io/sechelt">ported from MozVR</a>.</p>

<h2>Preview the VR experience for everyone</h2>
<p>Say you visit a webpage, and it opens up in split-screen mode barrel
distortion, chromatic aberration correction, personalized interpupillary
distance, and provides 6 DOF tracking. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkFyGNjaQ8k">Whoa</a>. You reach for your
VR headset only to find that you forgot it at work! How disappointing!
The vast majority of normal people with no head mounted display lying
around will surely be even more disappointed.</p>
<p>Responsive web design promises content which automatically adapts to
your viewing environment by using fluid layouts, flexible images,
proportional grids; a cocktail of modern web technologies. Similarly,
WebVR experiences need to work even without VR hardware. This has two
obvious advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>The vast majority of people that don't have VR hardware can still get
   a feeling for the experience.</li>
<li>Even if you have VR gear, donning it is a pain. This preview lets you
   quickly evaluate whether or not wearing is worth the hassle.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are some reasonable fallbacks to the in-helmet VR experience? The
main question boils down to emulating head tracking without wearing
anything on your head. On mobile phones, the obvious answer is to use
the gyroscope, for a <a href="http://googlespotlightstories.com/">Spotlight Stories</a>-type experience. On
desktop, we use the mouse to free-look, and also support turning using
the arrow keys. This covers enough of the 3DOF orientation that all HMDs
provide. Clearly missing are the three translational degrees of freedom,
but these are provided only by some VR headsets, and we can imagine some
<a href="http://topheman.github.io/parallax/">interesting fallbacks</a> for those too.</p>
<h2>Write once, run in any VR headset</h2>
<p>Remember the old "write once, run anywhere" promise? The web is the
closest thing we have to fulfilling it, but what it actually delivers is
often far from this ideal. The latest VR wave has barely begun and
already the web VR world is fragmented. Case in point,
<a href="http://vr.chromeexperiments.com/">vr.chromeexperiments.com</a> don't work on Oculus, and
<a href="http://mozvr.com/">mozvr.com</a> demos don't work in Cardboard.  The promise of WebVR
is that once it lands, all will be well in the world. However, this
means that we need to wait for WebVR to become fully baked. In other
words, we are blocked on the valiant efforts of our dear <a href="https://twitter.com/vvuk">WebVR</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Tojiro">implementers</a> (as well as the heavyweight browser development
process consisting of spec authors, security reviews, binary size, etc).</p>
<p>To speed up the process, we need a polyfill for WebVR which uses web
APIs to provide functionality to the WebVR specification (currently, in
<a href="https://github.com/vvuk/gecko-dev/blob/oculus/dom/webidl/VRDevice.webidl">IDL form</a>). In the absence of a WebVR implementation, the polyfill
kicks in and supports mobile VR headsets like Cardboard and Durovis
Dive, which are passive contraptions that just piggyback on the
smartness found in your smartphone.</p>
<h2>Introducing: WebVR Boilerplate</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR boilerplate project</a> is on github, and consists of
two parts. Firstly, the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill">WebVR polyfill</a> provides WebVR
support for Cardboard-compatible devices, and orientation tracking
fallbacks where no headset is available. The WebVR polyfill can also be
installed from npm (available via <code>npm install webvr-polyfill</code>).</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>CardboardHMDDevice</code>, provides a reasonable default for
   interpupillary distance and field of view for cardboard-like devices.</li>
<li>On mobile devices, a <code>GyroPositionSensorVRDevice</code>, which provides
   orientation through the <code>DeviceOrientationEvent</code>.</li>
<li>On PCs, a <code>MouseKeyboardPositionSensorVRDevice</code>, which provides
   orientation through keyboard and mouse events.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is designed to be used with <a href="http://threejs.org/">THREE.js</a> plugins that are built
for the WebVR API: <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/controls/VRControls.js">VRControls.js</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/effects/VREffect.js">VREffect.js</a>, but of course any valid usage of the WebVR API
should work (modulo bugs).</p>
<p>Secondly, the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate/blob/master/js/webvr-manager.js">WebVR manager</a> surfaces VR compatibility
using consistent iconography and simplifies transitioning in and out of
full VR mode. It also contains some of the best practices for making VR
work on the web, for example, using orientation lock to keep the phone
in landscape orientation, and a means of keeping the phone screen on. If
you're ready to dive in, the <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">github has all of the technical
information</a> available.</p>
<p>WebVR boilerplate is meant to make it easy to develop immersive
experiences that run on all VR hardware, including Oculus and Cardboard,
and also provide reasonable fallbacks when no specialized viewer is
available.</p>
<h2>WebVR boilerplate in action</h2>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the mozvr.com Sechelt demo." src="sechelt.png" /></p>
<p>I really liked Mozilla's <a href="http://mozvr.com/projects/sechelt/">Sechelt demo</a>, inspired by the
eponymous town on British Columbia's beautiful Sunshine Coast. I've
<a href="http://borismus.github.io/sechelt">ported it</a> to WebVR Boilerplate. The result is the same
demo, which works in Cardboard, as well as continuing to work on desktop
and mobile devices, and on the Oculus Rift via <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org/">Firefox Nightly</a> and
<a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ&amp;usp=sharing#list">Brandon's WebVR Chrome builds</a>. It also yielded less confusing
boilerplate code and a <a href="https://github.com/borismus/sechelt/commit/671cff9fc283b58d2ebce0ae6f0dfa3580050aab">simplified code base</a> since
there is no longer need for an unweildy conditional to determine whether
to use <code>DeviceOrientationControls</code>, <code>OrbitControls</code>, or <code>VRControls</code>,
and decide between <code>VREffect</code> and <code>StereoEffect</code>.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://twitter.com/borismus">let me know what you think</a> and feel free to point
out (or fix!) my mistakes on <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">the github</a>.</p>
