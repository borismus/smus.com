      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Almost every story in this collection elicits a “wow” and “yikes” gut reaction from me. Well written and original, many of these have been adapted into movies. </p>

<p>These stories do show some signs of aging: Cold War politics, Mechanical computers, Robots. But this makes them more authentic and gives them a distinct feeling. And while many things have changed, many others have not: Russia is still (again?) America’s adversary, Robots are still cool, and all of the tech nerds are obsessed with Mars. More fundamentally, Dick’s stories grapple with paranoia and mental instability, god, Dogs, the nature of reality, the evils of authoritarianism, and the banality of American consumerism.</p>

<p>These stories are dark, irreverent, funny, and sometimes profound. Highly recommended!</p>

<h2>Beyond Lies the Wub ★</h2>

<p>A large pacifist pig is mysteriously telepathic. It just wants to have philosophical discussions with you. But Captain Franco is hungry. He kills the Wub and eats it. His crew is disgusted by such despicable behaviour. But by the end of their dinner, Franco appears to be in a strangely philosophical frame of mind...</p>

<p>Is Franco a Wub now? Did the Wub become a pig from someone else? Is the Wub external to both?</p>

<h2>Roog</h2>

<p>A dog’s perspective. Boris the Guardian (dog) sees Roogs (garbage men) and guards his humans. Primitive but cute. </p>

<h2>Paycheck</h2>

<p>A mechanic is hired by a company doing advanced research. They pay well under the condition that they wipe his memories while he worked there. (Did this happen multiple times already?) Eventually, wanting to break the loop, the mechanic figures out a way to exact revenge.</p>

<p>PKD is obsessed with my name. The protagonist in this story has a Boris gun. (That said, this and the previous story are the only Borises featured in this collection).</p>

<h2>Second variety ★</h2>

<p>Following a nuclear winter started by the Russians, the Americans avoid complete defeat by retreating to the moon. As a resistance movement, The Americans develop robots built in autonomous underground factories. These robots self-improve and eventually become indistinguishable from humans, and exploit human emotion ruthlessly: type 1 is a small child clutching a teddy bear, Type 3 is a wounded soldier. </p>

<p>The story and world building is epic and extremely creepy. The story arc culminates when an American Major is left alone with 3 supposed Russians, one of which is a cylon of type 2. The crux is that it's not clear how many types there are in total, and this all plays out very dramatically, although I had some inkling of where things were going. Apparently the basis for “Screamers”.</p>

<h2>Imposter</h2>

<p>Another thriller of AIs and robots so convincing that even the robot itself can be a hundred percent convinced that it is in fact the person that it is emulating. Not a new idea even at Dick’s time but well executed.</p>

<h2>King of the Elves ★</h2>

<p>Cinematic and original take on insanity. The parallel worlds of gas station attendant and elf troll conflict is really compelling. It remains unclear which one is reality. I guess this is Dicks superpower: parallel un-realities. What is reality anyway?</p>

<h2>Adjustment Team ★</h2>

<p>Very stressful read. All of PKD seems to be like this: the protagonist discovers a crazy thing about reality, and is finds himself in an impossible situation where he is questioning his own sanity while trying to prove to someone that he is actually right. </p>

<p>An active God with a crazy plan to end the Cold War! I so love it when religion and science fiction meet. And comedy. I love the impeccable timing of annoying door to door vacuum and life insurance salesmen. </p>

<p>And another God-like dog. PKD is obsessed with dogs. I wonder if it's because dog is god backwards. I bet he had that thought more than once.</p>

<h2>Foster You’re Dead</h2>

<p>Ok. A little much for these COVID-19 times... All about a new American consumerism, stemming from over zealous cold warriors obsessed with survivalism. Mike's father is “anti-P”, a non survivalist without a backyard nuclear shelter. Eventually he caves in to the social pressure, but realizes he can't afford it. </p>

<p>Pretty good overall and timely in terms of survivalism being trendy. but slightly dated, in that consumer culture feels less pervasive. That said, I could see this coming back with something like <a href="https://medium.com/@RickByers/the-dawn-of-personal-biotech-cb0af0d52e4c">in-home PCR machines</a>.</p>

<h2>Upon the Dull Earth</h2>

<p>A uniquely creepy story featuring a young wife who finds an alien swarm of drones that call her siren song. Though her husband and family try to dissuade her, she succumbs to the force too soon by accident. In an attempt to bring her back, her husband makes a pact with the alien swarm, which turns her younger sister into her, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Masterfully crafted, this reads more like horror than science fiction. To the husband’s terror, each person he meets morbidly transforms into his beloved, first all of the members of her family, then their whole town and county, extending out to the whole world. The fear and terror of the despondent husband. Again, is this really happening, or is this an exploration into madness?</p>

<h2>Autofac</h2>

<p>In a post h-bomb destroyed world, humans subsist on essential goods that are forcibly delivered to their door. This automatic factory system was set in place as a contingency for when a nuclear war wipes out the world. But it's been a while and people are getting bored. The Autofac is programmed to keep delivering until people can self sustain, but there's one problem: the Autofac production pipeline is stripping earth bare.</p>

<p>Ultimately a super intelligence narrative, this story packs a punch, and is interesting in that it explores human-like competition in a super intelligent species.</p>

<h2>The Days of Perky Pat ★</h2>

<p>In a strange reversal, the surviving families of a nuclear war (called “flukies” because they survived due to luck) rely on their young children to get by. Meanwhile the parents spend all their time playing house with dolls. Perky Pat is a doll which is played by playing house in an elaborate game modelling the life that they used to have before the calamity. Their children, oblivious to the before the war, struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>A great concept and full of vitriol for consumerism, this story is a bit on the nose in its critique of consumerism, but definitely thought provoking. </p>

<h2>Precious Artifact ★</h2>

<p>During an existential battle between Terra and Proxima, a human terraforming engineer was sent to Mars to develop a colony there. For his years of labor, he was granted reunion with his family. But he wants to see what has come of earth. He insists on a trip, and is met there by a woman who shows him around. But he figures it out and forces Mary to reveal the truth. It quickly becomes clear that Terra lost the war, the woman is from Prox, and that everything he has been seeing is an illusion. His family is all dead, all human females too. All that survived are cats and dogs. </p>

<p>This story is all about layered deception. As a twist on an already tragic turn of events, it turns out that not even his newly gifted cat is real, merely a simulacrum. Everything is calculated by the Prox state, and there is a level of truth that is beyond anyone's grasp. </p>

<p>(As I sit here at home for days without seeing my parents and friends, I am starting to feel something unsettling creep in. What if all of these video calls are fake? This is another PKD story in the making.)</p>

<h2>A Game of Unchance</h2>

<p>Another Martian colony theme but wildly different from the others. A space-carnival arrives on Mars and the bored colonists end up losing a fortune in the carnival. Anticipating a return, they train up a psi wielding child to trick the carnival games and win big. This pans out but the spoils are tiny autonomous robots that the colonists accidentally activate, leading to mayhem. Interplan come and shut the village down. After a time the carnival returns. This time the winnings are a way to destroy the previous gift. It's as if the carnies had planned this all along. </p>

<h2>We can remember it for you wholesale</h2>

<p>A family man has an unfulfillable dream, an idea fix: to go to Mars. But he has no time and too many obligations. Luckily, there is a way out: he can hire a company to implant false memories about how he'd gone to Mars already, surely that will satisfy him? The company decides to implant the idea that he was a secret agent and sent to mars to kill a rebellion leader. As the man is placed under sedation to begin the memory grafting procedure, but then his real memories return to him: indeed he'd been to mars already as a secret agent and murdered a rebellion leader as instructed by his handlers. </p>

<p>As he realizes this, more and more memories return. Things get a bit silly, as every false memory that is about to be implanted turns out to be actually true. A clever reversal of the usual pattern of false memories which feel true but are false. </p>

<h2>Faith of our Fathers ★</h2>

<p>Great combination of religion, communism and science fiction. Set in an alternative future where China wins the Cold War, a young ambitious but cynical cadre is rising through the ranks of the CCP. A series of events lead him to take some drugs, and during a boring mandatory speech from the Great Leader, he sees a hallucination of the leader as a terrifying machine. But it turns out the drugs are actually sedatives that suppress his usually hallucinating state. It’s in the air and the water.</p>

<p>His boss presents him with a purity test comparing two essays. A new friend wants to understand more about the great leader and tells him how to tell the correct essay from the false one. (Incidentally they both feature good poems: one from 1001 tales, another a Song for St. Cecilias Day). As he gets promoted through the ranks, he is invited to a dinner party hosted by the great leader. Clandestinely, he takes that same anti-hallucinatory drug and sees the leader for who he truly is: God. He is both good and evil, and he doesn't give a fuck, mortally wounding the protagonist.</p>

<p>Cinematically, the cadre returns to his apartment feeling nihilistic, and, divulging news about the leader to his new girlfriend, dies from his injuries while loving her for the first time. </p>

<p>Powerfully written but somewhat incoherent. I bet PKD was super high writing this one. </p>

<h2>The Electric Ant</h2>

<p>A man has a workplace injury and loses his hand. The surgeon informs him that the hospital can do nothing to graft his hand back on, because he is a robot. Dick’s description of robotic technology is really quaint, involving lots of tape and visible circuits and whirring motors and such. </p>

<p>Anyway it's not so much about the fact that the man is a robot, but that he realizes that he can self-tinker and change his own perception by reprogramming various internal tapes and circuits. By punching a few extra holes in his tape he can see a park bench appear in his room, or a flock of ducks. Eventually he commits suicide by snipping his tape in a failed experiment. And as it turns out, in a somewhat juvenile “then he woke up” twist, his own subjectivity was intimately tied to everyone else's. A bit of a solipsistic mind-fuck, this one. </p>

<h2>A Little Something for Us Tempunauts</h2>

<p>One of the weaker stories in the collection, and thoroughly confusing because it's time travel related (never goes well). Set in an era of pioneer time travellers in the US, very much analogous to the Moon craze. A group of three time travellers suffer a fatal accident as they advance insufficiently far into the future and die. As they travel forward in time, they stop to see what their funeral processions are like.</p>

<p>The story takes a bizarre turn when it turns out that they want to be perpetually stuck in a time loop to relive their glory forever. And somehow they bring the rest of earth into this time loop with them. Shrug?</p>

<h2>The Exit Door Leads In</h2>

<p>In an Idiocracy-like future, a promising young Mr. Bibleman is noticed by the system, and wins a golden ticket to enrol in a military college. The sergeant administrator gives an introductory speech, indicating that students are not to be exposed to classified information. Bibleman is forced into a major focusing on pre-Socratic philosophy, which bores him. But on his very first day, he stumbles upon schematics for secret classified Panther Drive, which turns out to be general purpose technology for generating cheap energy. If released to the general public, such technology would be a boon to many suffering people. Should he leak it? What would the consequences be?</p>

<p>He is quickly caught by the sergeant, and forced to make a decision on an accelerated timeframe. Under pressure, he returns the printout out of a sense of loyalty, although it’s a tough decision for him. Disappointed, the sergeant boots him from the college. He should have made an independent judgement and leaked the memo instead. The whole College was a setup intended to filter out independent thinkers from conformists.</p>

<p>PKD makes a provocative claim: society self destructed because of complacency and rule following. Fuck loyalty and think for yourself. Surprisingly non-subtle and didactic, but an effective way to deliver the message.</p>

<h2>Rutavaara’s Case</h2>

<p>After resuscitating Rutavaara, one of the three person crew who died in an astronautics accident, the Proxians watch her mind’s eye replay her last living moments. But this time, Jesus Christ is also apparent. It's funny already, just because of the irreverent way in which Philip K. Dick uses Christ. In a bizarre twist, the Proxians decide to take advantage of the opportunity and introduce their own version of Christ into Rutavaara’s dream. Christ died for our sins, but the Proxian Christ (a sort of anti-Christ) kills for your sins, and so it was in Rutavaara’s terrifying mind. Instead of taking communion, you get eaten.</p>

<p>Interestingly written as a sort of apology from the Proxian perspective. The narrator appears to apologize to their deity. He concludes that the earthlings are thoroughly wrong about their umwelt. Meanwhile PKD is sitting and observing both bizarre theologies, and laughing.</p>

    <title>Where Good Ideas Come From</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/where-good-ideas-come-from"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I liked this book, a succinct refutal of a bunch of tropes associated with innovation, littered with nice analogies and good quotes, and mercifully short.</p>

<p>At any point, innovation can only occur at the edge of possibility, at the <strong>adjacent possible</strong>. If you’re not bold enough, it’s already been done. Too bold and you’re ahead of your time. This model nicely explains why important discoveries are often arrived at simultaneously by multiple discovers in different places (called <strong>multiples</strong>).</p>

<p>Johnson describes environments conducive to innovation as <strong>liquid networks</strong>. In a gas, atoms are far apart and chaotic. They may collide, but they won’t stick. In a solid, atoms are too constrained and won’t have a chance to interact at all. A prehistoric human society is like a gas: ideas may form but the lifestyle is too chaotic for anything to stick. Religious autocracies of the European Dark Ages and post-Enlightenment Arab world are like a solid: society is too restrictive to even let ideas form in the first place.</p>

<p>In general, Johnson rejects the narrative of the Eureka moment, attributing success to <strong>slow hunches</strong>, which take a long time to brew in a person’s mind. In a liquid network, multiple slow hunches have a good chance of meeting, and an insightful person can combine the two into a coherent idea.</p>

<p>The author compares the web to cities and coral reefs, both as examples of productive, dense, liquid networks where entities flow freely. Citing <a href="/books/scale-by-geoffrey-west/">Scale by Geoff West</a>, he notes that big cities aren’t just proportionally more inventive than small ones, but super-linearly so, with higher per-capita output. Just like cities allow free mingling of people and their ideas, the web enables this for the whole world serving like a “dating service for promising hunches”, increasing <strong>serendipity</strong>.</p>

<p>The way to nurture a slow hunch is to take copious amounts of notes, as evidenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">Commonplace books</a> (new to me), which became popular during the European Renaissance, popularized by Locke. Charles Darwin’s commonplace book is mentioned quite a bit as an example.</p>

<p>The “missed connection” example he provides in a non-liquid network are two hunches that could have met to stop the 9/11 aircraft hijackings, but never did due to the solid-like FBI bureaucracy.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Memo">Phoenix Memo</a> advising about bin Laden’s coordinated effort to send students to US aviation schools.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacarias_Moussaoui">Moussaoui’s</a> arrest at a flight training school in Minnesota.</li>
</ol>

<p>Continuing the analogy of liquid networks and water, Johnson lauds <strong>desirable spillover</strong> from one group of humans to another, encouraging cross-pollination of ideas, and a multidisciplinary approach. Examples of this include Building 20 at MIT, the “womb of the institute”, a temporary building that was at the heart of hacker culture, discoveries like LIGO, and great companies like Bose. By having a place that breeds so much intellectual diversity, you can imagine ideas crossing boundaries. When one idea goes from one domain to another, it’s called <strong>exaptation</strong>. For example, Gutenberg’s printing press borrowed the screw press mechanism, which was used for pressing olives into oil and grapes into wine.</p>

<p>Naturally, as ideas form and evolve, many leads go nowhere. Edison said “I didn't fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” At this point, this is definitely a cliche.</p>

<p>The book concludes with a series of 2x2 tables showing four kinds of inventions (borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks">Wealth of Networks</a>):</p>

<pre><code>+------------+------------+---------+
|            | Individual | Network |
+------------+------------+---------+
| Market     | 1          | 2       |
+------------+------------+---------+
| Non-market | 3          | 4       |
+------------+------------+---------+
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Market / individual: solo entrepreneur or private corporation.</li>
<li>Market / network: marketplace with multiple individuals.</li>
<li>Non-market / individual: hobby or amateur scientist, sharing ideas freely.</li>
<li>Non-market / network: open source or academic env where ideas can be built on freely.</li>
</ol>

<p>Quadrant 1 occupies the popular imagination: instigated by solo inventor driven by profit like Edison, or in this case he picks on Carrier, inventor of the modern air conditioner. But in an analysis of inventions from 15th century until the present, Johnson concludes that most inventions fall into quadrant 4, the non-market network. </p>

<p>The author doesn’t do a convincing job of explaining why each invention falls into each quadrant, and in many cases I think the call is very subjective, but the framework is interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>Johnson ends in an interesting take on Darwin’s work. Darwin’s big idea is often popularized as <strong>survival of the fittest</strong>, but Darwin himself makes clear that the right environment is perhaps even more important. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef#Darwin's_paradox">In The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</a>, published in 1842, Darwin described how coral reefs were found in some tropical areas but not others, with no obvious cause. Tropical waters contain few nutrients yet a coral reef can flourish like an "oasis in the desert”, supporting over one-quarter of all marine species. His seminal work concludes with this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/lost-enlightenment-by-frederick-starr"/>

      <div>
        <p>I first learned of this book after a quick conversation with Mark, whom I’ve only met once in-person. I was just finishing Debt, and found the book intriguing, especially the parts about the monetary systems in Islamic societies. Mark suggested this book, and indeed it covers a period of history that I know basically nothing about. With my interest piqued already, I decided to take the plunge.</p>

<p>This book was both broad and deep, covering an era from about 750 (a nominal end of the Arab conquest) through 1150 (roughly the time when intellectual fruits of the enlightenment were starting to wilt). It is well written, so in the moment you think you understand what’s happening, but afterwards it turns out that everything is really complicated.</p>

<p>My overall feeling after reading this book is that it serves well as a comprehensive introduction to the topic. But the topic is quite complex, and as a complete noob, I found myself struggling a little bit. As I write this summary, I constantly have to consult Wikipedia to understand the region and its civilizational chronology. Keeping track of the giant cast of ancient Arab, Turkish, and Mongol characters that the author presents is also a challenge. On the other hand, the introduction really hooked me and the first half of the book flowed very well. I did come close to abandoning the book about 3/4 through, especially since the Turkish empires just before the Mongol invasion seemed to be somewhat dull from both action and cultural perspectives. But it picks up again with Genghis Khan and Timur and their respective empires, and then the conclusion does a great job of tying it all together. I listened to the last chapter twice!</p>

<p>I don't know why, but these Soviet stamps of great Islamic scientists are really
appealing:</p>

<p><img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/al-kwarizmi.png"/>
<img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/al-biruni.png"/>
<img style="width: 30%" src="/assets/ibn-sina.png"/></p>

<h1>Where: cities and regions</h1>

<p>I left myself a TODO as I was summarizing: “understand all of the cities/regions? mentioned in this book, put them on a map. Who would have been living there at the time? And maybe one day visit them.” So far, I only have <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r3caNCqtH91TXpF2rug03XzKByZ1BkdL&amp;usp=sharing">a Google map</a>, but it’s a start! The trip may have to wait for global pandemics and regional instabilities to wane.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, it was never clear which name corresponded to a city, and which to a region. Trying to resolve this online isn’t that simple. One is confounded by inconsistent Latinization. Khwarazm has been known also as Chorasmia, Khaurism, Khwarezm, Khwarezmia, Khwarizm, Khwarazm, Khorezm, Khoresm, Khorasam, Kharazm, Harezm, Horezm, and Chorezm. </p>

<p>Here’s a crazy tidbit: by 1200, Merv (aka Marv, Merw, Mary, …) was the largest city in the world with possibly half a million souls. Thousands were employed just to maintain its irrigation systems. Yet I hadn’t even heard of the place. Much of central Asian architecture of the time was lost because buildings were not built out of stone but of more perishable materials. But the cities were huge and glorious for their time, according to eyewitnesses. </p>

<p>Later into the book, there were some familiar places mentioned which helped me anchor a bit. My dad’s business trips to Taskhent, Almaty in the heart of the region where some of my friends were born, as well as song references: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmfjt0DnfCs">Tian Shan mountains, lake Issik Kul</a>. I love it when I have multiple angles on the same concept. It feels like things snap into place!</p>

<h1>Why did the Islamic golden age happen?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Hardship and need for water meant complex irrigation systems required advances in science and technology.</li>
<li>Subsequent general prosperity (great harvests) meant intellectuals could devote time to science and art. </li>
<li>Social norms from pre-Islam: rulers needed to patronize the arts to show their greatness. </li>
<li>Religious pluralism: Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Zoroastrianism were common and coexisted. As Islamic scholars documented each prior culture, they adopted pieces of it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why did the golden age end?</h1>

<p>The author does a good job dismantling Sonia Brenkes’ argument that there was no decline, and that westerners are just culturally insensitive. I liked that. Starr illustrates a clear decline both quantitatively and qualitatively. He puts a lot of the blame on Sunni-Shia conflicts and restrictions in freedoms of expression. Universities languished while madrasas thrived. Printing took a very long time to be adopted. </p>

<p>The Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavids, Empires that followed Timur and the period covered in the book, were rich and powerful, but focused on aesthetics, art, and architecture over science. Many great books crumbled from neglect over this period. Europeans were the ones who launched efforts to preserve the ailing manuscripts. </p>

<p>The decline happened sometime around 1100. Starr enumerates many potential reasons for the decline, and rejects each in turn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Climate change: the region’s climate hasn't changed much then to now. The efforts of the oasis irrigators were thwarted when the mongols came to power, but this was after the decline. </li>
<li>Innate tendencies of Mongols: mongols came well after the start of the decline so cannot be the cause. </li>
<li>Vasco de Gamma, because his sea route opened trade which impoverished the land routes: unlikely, since the sea route was encouraged by high tariffs and bandits along the land routes. Also intellectual decay came before economic decay. Great Caravanserai were built in 11 and 12th centuries.</li>
<li>Decline in patronage from rich nobles and split up of large empires into emirates: the same laws were in place during cultural vitality, same ability to donate to foundations. But at the point of decline, money went to madrasas and not individual creators. </li>
<li>The Turks sucked, but the Persians were awesome: There were definitely greats among the Turks though. </li>
<li>A decline of large empires: Timur’s was the last, but again this splintering happened well after the start of the decline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately the author decides the main reason for decline is a rift between Sunni and Shiite sects that led to a surge in intolerance. Rational thought and science was caught on the crossfire between the two. Great thinkers like Al-Ghazali gave firepower for restrictive legalistic interpretation of Sharia which led to tighter links between religion and statecraft. Also the rise of Sufism turned society to metaphysics and away from science.</p>

<h1>Great people and their ideas</h1>

<p>I didn’t get a great sense for the full impact of the intellectual output of Central Asia during this golden age. It still seems to me like the largest contributions were preserving Greek works, and popularizing Indian mathematics.</p>

<p>Great thinkers found themselves between three fundamental camps intuition, reason, and revelation. At first, reason reigned, math (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>) science (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a>) and medicine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna">Ibn Sina</a>) flourished, free thinkers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi">Al-Razi</a>) were given a platform, and strange Islamic-rationalist hybrids went to great extremes. Later, the mood changed and revelation became the last word (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali">Al-Ghazali</a>).</p>

<h2>Al-Kwarazmi’s mathematics</h2>

<p>Al-Khwarizmi (780 - 850) was a popularizer of mathematics and integrated the Indian invented decimal notation system into his works. He wrote practical books for tradesmen to apply mathematics to their craft, formalizing some algebraic manipulations. He and many others exemplified the sort of mathematical, physical, medical intellectual activity of the time.</p>

<h2>Extremely rational Islam!?</h2>

<p>For a time, reason was so revered in the Islamic world, that rationalist schools of Islamic theology emerged. The adherents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%CA%BFtazila">Muʿtazili</a> school are best known for rejecting the widely accepted doctrine of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, deducing that if the Quran is the word of God, he logically "must have preceded his own speech".</p>

<p>The movement reached its political height in 833 under Caliph al-Ma'mun, when Sunni and Shia scholars were punished, imprisoned, or even killed unless they conformed to Muʿtazila doctrine. The policy lasted for fifteen years, continuing through the reigns of al-Ma'mun's immediate successors.</p>

<h2>Ibn-Sina and Al-Biruni debate</h2>

<p>Ibn Sina (980 – 1037) and Al-Biruni (973 - 1050) were contemporaries and had a public debate which took place over many years and can be traced in their preserved letters. This feels very modern, western renaissance-y, and they dug deep into fundamental questions. If heat rises, how does the sun’s heat reach the earth? Was Aristotle right that planets have neither weight nor mass?</p>

<p>Biruni focused on physics and mathematics and reason. He was an empiricist at heart, and very practical. Biruni definitely has the author’s sympathies (and mine, of course), and seems like the winner on almost all counts. He seems ridiculously advanced in many ways, often having really good hunches for science that would be discovered 500 years later. Biruni suggested that maybe orbits could be elliptical, which was shocking given previous assumptions that movement can only be linear or circular. He somehow knew and wrote about fossils, which is very surprising given a recently <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/art-science-deep-time-conceiving-inconceivable-in-19th/id1246993791?i=1000464847732">Long Now talk</a>, which dates the first European fossil discoveries to the 19th century.</p>

<p>In many cases in the debate, Ibn Sina was right, like suggesting that light does not emanate from the eyes, as was the platonic ideal, but instead comes from the world. </p>

<h2>Al-Ghazali’s anti-rationalism</h2>

<p>Al-Ghazali (1058 - 1111) was a philosopher and theologian that studied with rationalists but adopted an anti-rationalist stance and sided with islamic mystics. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the sultanate became more extreme and intolerant, and Al-Ghazali gave them the theory on which to justify their politics, confidently suggesting that philosophers were apostates, and that even after a conversion to Islam, the subject may be a closeted unbeliever. Thus if a philosopher fell out of favor with authorities he could be labeled an apostate and effectively lynched.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali’s patron was killed, forcing him to change directions towards Sufism, a rising branch of Islamic mysticism. He justified his new path as the best possible life for all people with his characteristic zeal. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers">The Incoherence of the Philosophers</a>, Al-Ghazali solved many problems at once, explaining his popularity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Devastating weapons to use against philosophers.</li>
<li>Justified moving Sufism into central Muslim life.</li>
<li>Shifted political and intellectual atmosphere from philosophizing from first principles to sharia law.</li>
</ol>

<p>Al-Ghazali influences many theologians and philosophers, from Acquinas to Hume to Maimonides. </p>

<p>A wise modern science administrator once quipped, “an active scientist is always right, and the younger he is, the more right he is”. In contrast, Al-Ghazali wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important truths are already fully accessible in the Quran and Hadiths and are embodied in the Sharia. Faith, not science and rigorous thought, is the key to unlocking them. It it is most likely to appear among the elders (Aksakals) or Sufi masters whose lifelong pursuit of wisdom gives them the right and duty to teach the young. Let them impart wisdom, and let the young listen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Omar Khayyam</h2>

<p>Omar Khayyam was a great scientist and mathematician from Nishapur, active during the Seljuk era. It was only in his old age and exile from Merv, he turned to wine and poetry for which he is most known today. He watched in horror Al-Ghazali rose to prominence.</p>

<h1>Chronology</h1>

<p>Most of what follows is chronological-ish summary of what happened in the region before, during, and after the Islamic enlightenment.</p>

<h2>Before the Arab conquest (pre-622)</h2>

<p>This was the time of the first mounted horses, the first saddles in the first stirrups. This gave the Central Asians huge advantage over chariots. In addition it made them more mobile and nomadic. However these were not the stereotypical nomads that conflicted with city dwellers. These peoples needed goods that would come from cities, and the author paints a rather convivial picture of the two groups of people living in relative harmony. Central Asian cities were large and flexible in relation to Mediterranean cities which were quite fragile and small.
￼￼￼￼￼
Due to the harsh conditions of the region, engineers really needed to build solid irrigation systems. And the public understood this, and so technocrats were elevated in status. A lot of technical domains involved passing knowledge down from generation to generation, as a result of these professions were often practiced by groups of ethnically homogeneous people. For example glassblowing was predominantly Jewish practice. The pre-Islamic Central Asians were super literate. Sadly, little is left of that era because the Arabs burned a lot of their books in their invasion. ￼￼￼</p>

<p>The arid conditions were such that cities had to be built around oases which were pretty far spaced from one another. This meant that you couldn't really have large empires, as in Egypt for example all along the Nile.</p>

<p>Zoroastrianism was dominant in the area and had a huge impact on major world religions. I know nothing about it other than that “Thus Spake Zarathustra” song. Apparently Zoroaster invented the idea of heaven, hell, and redemption.</p>

<p>By 800, Roman roads were no longer needed and fell into disrepair. Instead, camels were very actively used for transport of goods but they couldn't carry as much weight as wheeled carts so trade skewed towards materials that were especially valuable and not particularly heavily. This is the “silk road”, although silk was just one of many goods, including lapis lazuli, emeralds, gold and other precious metals, ferried across this route. Dromedary or single humped camel's were phased out in favor of Bactrian (two hump) camels who are more hardy.</p>

<h3>Fate of old books</h3>

<p>Interesting trend of book burning by conquering civilizations. A Chinese dynasty referred to in Debt also burned all records kept before them. And the conquering Muslims burned huge swaths of history, impeding historians even today. But not all book destruction was so sudden, a lot of Islamic enlightenment books were simply allowed to decompose through neglect.</p>

<h2>Arab conquest (622-661)</h2>

<p>First the conquest in Central Asia proceeded slowly. Over centuries it rolled out, also stunted by internal conflict within the Islamic faith, the schism between followers of Mohameds direct line and the Ussayids.  Echoes of which continue to this day with the Sunni Shia rift. </p>

<h3>Islamic schism cheat sheet</h3>

<p>After Muhammad’s death, a schism emerged in Islam: who can lead the Muslim world? Two main factions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any Muslim can lead (Umayyad Caliphate, 661 - 750). Now known as Sunni (HQ: Saudi Arabia)</li>
<li>Only blood descendants of Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law and appointed heir, can lead (Abbasid Caliphate, 750 - 1258). Now known as Shia (HQ: Iran)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Umayyads (661 - 750)</h2>

<p>A particularly vicious conqueror <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutayba_ibn_Muslim">Qutayba ibn Muslim</a> (Umayyad) set out to finally quell central Asian forces. He was uncharacteristically brutal, likely out of a lack of self confidence. He was responsible for burning whole libraries of Zoroastrian works at Buchara, and killing and enslaving thousands brutally. Seeking certainty, Qutayba asked his forces to swear fealty to him, and was met with silence, only to be murdered days later. </p>

<p>Following Qutayba came a more moderate governor and general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasr_ibn_Sayyar">Nasr ibn Sayyar</a> who undid some of the more draconian policies, but only after a series of terrible mistakes which alienated the indigenous population, by first levying a tax on non Muslims, then having a mass conversion which undid the tax base, and then a law which forced men to prove their faith by undergoing circumcision.</p>

<h2>Abbasids (750 - 1258)</h2>

<p>Ultimately a general named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Muslim">Abu Muslim</a> consolidated a lot of power in Central Asia, was quite heterogenous in his faith and grew a large coalition army consisting mostly of central Asians. Ultimately these forces obliterated the remaining Umayyads in Damascus and quelled the Chinese forces to the East. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mansur">Al-Mansur</a> was selected to rule the Abbasids, who were at this point concerned about Abu Muslim’s faith and loyalty. Mansur was a hard liner and didn't trust Abu Muslim, ultimately having him killed in hopes of stamping out any form of Shiism and quelling Central Asian influence. He dumped Abu Muslim’s body in the Tigris. This effectively martyred the man, who was extremely popular, and led to many more rebellions against the already unpopular Abbasid rulers. Many of these claimed to be in Abu Muslim’s blood line, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Muqanna">Al-Muqanna</a>, famously wearing a green face mask, inspiring stories by Borges and Moore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much the way Greek culture eventually conquered a triumphant Rome, Central Asian culture was now in position to conquer the Abbasids and their new capital, Baghdad. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Baghdad modeled after Merv (762)</h3>

<p>The most culturally important city of the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_city_of_Baghdad">Baghdad</a> was essentially a planned circular city, likely modelled after Merv’s administrative centre, with Merv-imported architects and craftsmen central in the planning and construction. It was built my Al-Mansur, the same Abassids caliph that killed Abu Muslim. Parts of the city were named in honor of Merv too, including a street and a quarter. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>, Al-Mansur’s grandson eventually became caliph. His leadership coincided with a golden age in Baghdad, exemplified by the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>, the Grand Library of Baghdad. His rise to power was in part sponsored by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmakids">Barmakids</a>, a very rich family of central Asian heritage and with deep Buddhist roots. They were great sponsors of science, medicine, and philosophy. They are most famously known for having translated large numbers of classic Greek texts into Arabic.</p>

<p>Translations were selective. Only Greek texts, no Latin works were translated. Also no tragedies, history, or drama was translated, mostly focused on philosophy and medicine and science. </p>

<p>Baghdad has a glorious phase as described in 1001 nights, but descended into a regression that lasted several generations. Ultimately it's golden age was relatively short lived and the cultural and scientific centre shifted back to central Asian cities. </p>

<h3>Decline of Baghdad (808)</h3>

<p>Baghdad's golden age was short. The new caliph realized that Central Asia would need its autonomy and expanded the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan">Khorasan</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahir_ibn_Husayn">Tahir</a>, his appointed governor. Tahir promptly declared independence and Khorasan continued to be a client state, paying tribute to Baghdad but largely autonomous. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Khorasan comprised the present territories of northeastern Iran, parts of Afghanistan and much of Central Asia. The province was often subdivided into four quarters. Nishapur (present-day Iran), Marv (present-day Turkmenistan), Herat and Balkh (present-day Afghanistan) were the centers, respectively, of the westernmost, northernmost, southernmost, and easternmost quarters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tahir’s son took over after his deceased father and instituted broad minded educational reforms, insisting that even the poor farmers need to be educated. Simultaneously, there was some unrest among the patricians of the city. The rift was around a more or less literal interpretation of the Quran, but ultimately which of the two camps would wield power over the other. Ultimately the whole land owning class gently self destructed. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur">Nishapur</a> was the cultural capital in the 9th century, and on the backdrop described above, much philosophical activity ensured. From hardcore Islamist literalists to militant atheists, to Aristotelian rationalists that were still fervent Muslims. </p>

<p>A populist band of brothers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya%27qub_ibn_al-Layth_al-Saffar">Ya'qub</a> and his younger led a rebellion against the Abbasid caliph, threatening Baghdad. Barely Islamic at all, this band restored even more autonomy to the central Asian area of Khorasan. Eventually defeated, he and his younger brother briefly formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffarid_dynasty">Saffarid dynasty</a>, autonomous large chunk of Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Samanid Empire (819 – 999)</h2>

<p>Samanid state was founded by four brothers; Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas. Each took control over a large city in the region. Ultimately one of them took over but did so bloodlessly, removing just brothers from power without killing them.</p>

<p>The Samanid allowed for a more diverse cultural base, keeping Arabic but also allowing indigenous languages: Persian, Turkic. This ultimately paved the way for more Turkish influence in the region.</p>

<h2>The Kara-Khanids (990 - 1040)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Khanid_Khanate">Kara-Khanids</a>, Turkish nomads began moving west. As the Samanid empire was declining, they made easy targets. They converted to Islam (from their native Tengrism) but weren't especially religious. Where they invaded Central Asia from the east and gained control over large chunks of it, they erected incredibly tall minarets known as victory towers, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyan_minaret">Kalyan minaret</a>. They were mostly militaristic and remained true to their steppe culture. </p>

<p>This is also a time of Turkish nationalism and a general popularization of the Turkic languages. Their capital was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasagun">Balasagun</a> (now destroyed), but the empire extended quite far west, into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand">Samarkand</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termez">Termez</a>.</p>

<h2>The Seljuk Empire (1037 – 1194)</h2>

<p>The Seljuks were a Turkish people that originated near the Aral Sea, but expanded westward, taking Khorasan, and eventually going as far west as to conquer most of Anatolia.</p>

<p>Sanjar, The last ruler of the Seljuks favored monumental architecture, which turned out to be quite influential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Ahmed_Sanjar">Sanjar’s tomb</a> inspired the Duomo in Florence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral">Isaakievskiy Sobor</a> in St. Petersburg, and the Capitol Building in Washington DC.</p>

<h2>Mongol Invasions (1219 - 1370)</h2>

<p>Genghis Khan had no initial plan to conquer Khwarezm. He sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor. Hoping to unify Turks and Mongols under one nomadic banner ("people in felt tents”), Genghis Khan successfully conquered other nomadic peoples with relatively little bloodshed. To establish trade ties, Genghis sent a 500-man caravan, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalchuq">governor of Otrar</a> had them arrested as spies and executed the entire party with the Shah’s support. </p>

<p>The mongols were swift and ruthless in their revenge. Genghis Khan besieged Otrar in 1219, which resisted for five months and then fell. In the ensuing war, lasting less than two years, the Khwarezmid Empire was destroyed. The Mongols ruled</p>

<h2>Timurid Empire (1370 - 1507)</h2>

<p>Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage, established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>By 1500, the Timurid empire was in decline due to infighting and pressure from Safavids and Ottomans. Babar, who claimed to be Genghis Khan’s descendant from father, and Timur’s descendant from mother, founded the Mughal empire which ruled over India. The three major Islamic empires split between them most of the Islamic world.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many open questions and lingering threads remain, as well as directions for further exploration.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’d never heard of the epic poem Shahnameh, but it seems to differ from its Greek predecessors by being more inward looking and existential in nature. Worth a looksee if there are good translations.</li>
<li>Read the Borges stories “The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv”, and “The Zahir”.</li>
<li>Read something by Omar Khayyam. Maybe “The Rubaiyat”?</li>
<li>The first poem in Lalla-Rookh (1817) by Thomas Moore is “The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan”.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>“Debt” has been on my reading list for a long time. I once attempted the hard copy, but abandoned it quickly. It was mentioned again on a podcast by Saul Griffith, just as I was starting to get interested in the role of financing advances in innovation and progress. So I decided to give it another shot. This is the second edition of the book, updated after the financial crisis and after the 99% protest movement, which the author helped organize.</p>

<p>My overall feeling is that I learned a lot. The author, Graeber, is an anthropologist, and clearly erudite in a lot of adjacent fields as well. On the flip side, especially toward the end, the author’s personal beliefs became too prominent, at times transforming informative book into angry screed. Understandably, this detracted from the credibility of the book.</p>

<h1>Moral confusion around debt</h1>

<p>Graeber starts many chapters of the book with awesome quotes. Here’s one: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you owe the bank one hundred thousand, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank one hundred million, you own the bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Graeber describes how small-scale societies were based on mutual obligation, but as they grew and matured, debt became identified with money, became more transferrable from one person to another organization, to a yet larger one. Every step in that chain becomes less personal and more cruel. This may be the case, but it remains unclear to me that we can do better given the scale of our current societies.</p>

<p>Interestingly, many monetary systems are based on a small group of creditors giving out a large loan to the government that is then never repaid. This is true of Britain today, where the system nominally rests on a 1 million pound loan given by a few wealthy merchants many centuries ago. </p>

<h1>Myth of barter</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong. – H. L. Mencken</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the afterword, Graeber reflects on the book and suggests that this chapter was his strongest. I agree: it is least rambling, most concrete and informative.</p>

<p>Barter is often imagined as a prehistoric mode of exchange by economists, as a precursor to money. A point out that a society that employed barter would require a two sided marketplace for each transaction (eg. I want shoes but have pencils, so need to find a shoe vendor that wants pencils specifically). The way out is to create a multilateral deal, or invent a medium of exchange (money). </p>

<p>Except there are no known societies that employ barter internally. This is where Graeber’s anthropology background really comes in handily. Barter tends to be used between strangers, and typically as a single turn game, not a repeated one. </p>

<p>In fact, the system that predates bullion wasn’t barter, but one of lending and ledgers. This was the dominant system in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Coins came later and were relatively unimportant for a long time.</p>

<h1>Wizard of oz</h1>

<p>Apparently there is an economics reading of the Wizard of Oz: </p>

<p>The Wicked Witches of the East and West are the coastal banking elites. The scarecrow is the prototypical farmer that gets screwed over but doesn't have the brains to address the underlying issue. The tin man is the proletarian worker who doesn't have the heart to side with the farmer. The lion is the political elite that doesn't have the courage to step out of rank. And they all march to the White House. The Emerald City is full of greenbacks, and many other gems refer to the proposed silver standard. All of it is a parable for William Jennings Brian's attempt at presidency and the first marches on the White House.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz">Turns out</a> this isn’t Graeber’s invention.</p>

<h1>Primordial debt</h1>

<p>Graeber explores the link between monetary debt and its predecessor, spiritual debt. Linguistically, the two concepts are deeply intertwined, most strikingly, German “gelt” and English “guilt” share a root (many other examples in book).</p>

<p>In a sense, you owe your existence to your parents, to society, and ultimately to God. But this is a debt you can never fully repay, although you must try anyway. Would you want to be square with your parents? If even possible, That implies you want nothing to do with them. Graeber’s take is that our relationship with cosmos is ultimately nothing like a commercial transaction. </p>

<p>Here, we tend towards a more philosophical exploration. I enjoyed it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are free from your debt to your ancestors when you become an ancestor; you are free from your debt to the sages when you become a sage, you are free from your debt to humanity when you act with humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Morality and economics</h1>

<p>Communism as defined by “for each according to their needs, from each according to ability” is often practiced in smaller units, most notably the family, but not successfully in large scale societies.</p>

<p>Giving gifts to low status folks is fraught. You risk putting them down because there’s no way for them to pay you back. Conversely, giving gifts to superiors is fraught too. What can you really give to a king? It often leads to an expectation of such gifts and ultimately a tradition of tribute. Even to peers, gift giving can often be competitive. A fancy meal is met with a fancier meal.</p>

<p>At the same time, being slightly indebted to peers is a great way to build social cohesion. It feels like in western society many don't often feel indebted to other individuals, only to institutions. </p>

<h1>History of honor</h1>

<p>I struggled a bit with this chapter. Graeber drives at this idea that commerce is inherently based on violence, and is deeply rooted in slavery. This is where Graeber’s personal opinions start muddying the waters and the going gets tough for the first time. But he recovers and there’s more meat to be had.</p>

<h1>Money vs debt</h1>

<p>Currency and more traditional debt and credit system arrangements came in and out of fashion over time. Money correlated to periods of war, because it was a time of mass mobilization, and having currency made it easier to pay soldiers. Credit systems flourished during periods of peace because they relied on trust networks to operate.</p>

<p>Many forms of currency existed before bullion (gold and silver). Cowrie shells were commonly used as money in China and other societies. Coins were first invented in Anatolia around 600 BCE by private citizens. Almost immediately they were adopted by the state. Same pattern repeats in other civilizations.</p>

<p>Coins and silver bars were mostly controlled by the rich, mostly stored in temples for religious purposes. But during times of conquest they were broken up and split up among warriors. Alexander the Great’s forces numbered 120,000 and had a daily wage of half a ton of silver! When he conquered, he coined new money from Assyrian reserves to pay his army. </p>

<p>In India, Ashoka began his rule by conquering a neighbor, one of the last independent Indian states. He won the war but at a huge cost of hundreds of thousands of deaths, and vowed never to fight again. Coinage began to dwindle and was replaced by system of credits. </p>

<p>Origins of interest are unknown but it was already happening by 2500 BCE in Mesopotamia! In the ancient world, a jubilee ritual of “breaking the tablets”, annulling all debts was done on a semi-regular basis. Jubilee was also demanded by peasant uprisings and granted by kings to mollify the people. </p>

<h1>Axial age</h1>

<p>(Interestingly, I am attempting to tackle a series of lectures on this topic. Haven’t made much progress yet, but this angle was specifically financial.)</p>

<p>Coined by Karl Jaspers, the Axial Age is a period around 800 BCE to 200 BCE marking a sudden beginning of reasoned inquiry. A wide range of positions in philosophy suddenly bloomed simultaneously in many places. Consider the lifespans of a few but diverse philosophers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pythagoras - 570-495 BC</li>
<li>Buddha - 563-483 BCE </li>
<li>Confucius - 551-479 BCE</li>
</ul>

<p>Graeber extends his timespan to 600 CE, also including the “spiritual age” when Jesus and Mohamed and the Rabbinical tradition came into being. These were times of war, and transactions needed to be anonymous. Luckily, cash enabled this, and radically simplified all of the complex dynamics of trust-based systems. This led to the cold, hard, rational calculations and a profusion of new concepts: profit and loss.</p>

<p>Interestingly, with the advent of both impersonal greed and philosophical thought, religious spheres emerged, promulgating the idea that giving is better than taking, common to all religions of the axial age including Buddhism, Christianity, Islam. This is when the concept of Charity first enters the picture.</p>

<h1>Middle Ages</h1>

<p>The Middle Ages have a bad rap, but this is in large part because of the way that they are often presented in stark opposition to the renaissance, oftentimes by people living in the renaissance. The terms themselves are illuminating: a dark age turned into an era of rebirth!</p>

<p>True, cities like London and Paris which blossomed during the renaissance, were just remote outposts of the Roman Empire. When the empire fell, these cities returned to their prior obscurity. And even in these frontier towns, records were continued to be kept in Roman currencies. Meanwhile Rome and Constantinople flourished. </p>

<p>Around the same time in India, Buddhism was flourishing and monasteries were funded by permanent trusts where the principal was lent out at a steep (15%) yearly interest rate. This was super surprising to me, since I’ve associated trusts like these with modernity.</p>

<p>In China, paper money emerged out of convenience in the 10th century. Rather than carrying strings of coins, which incidentally is why coins had a hole in the middle — to thread a string through for ease of carry, merchants traveling long distances preferred to carry less so developed a system of stamped paper notes. These were initially rejected by Chinese authorities, but being unable to control the practice adequately, they ultimately created a bureau to regulate the practice. A common pattern for China. </p>

<h2>The Arab world</h2>

<p>Graeber considers the Arab world at this time as basically western, an intellectual successor to the Greeks and Romans. Just like Middle Eastern Europe (then in shambles), the Arab world was attempting to synthesize the greek tradition with the prophets of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In stark contrast, the East was completely different. Super interesting 10,000 foot view.</p>

<p>Islam was super progressive for its time, addressing many of the injustices of the Axial Age. This included prohibitions against kidnapping into slavery, and also the hard stance against usury. But despite that, Islam had no issue with commerce in general, Mohamed himself at one point working as a merchant. Early Muslim states flourished economically and had banks that charged fees rather than compounding interest due to usury prohibitions. As a result, banking on its own wasn't a lucrative enough profession so many rich merchants doubled as banks for lesser brethren. Much of the economy was based on trust, and there was a real aversion to government interference in market mechanisms.</p>

<p>Apparently Adam Smith actually cites a lot of Persian economists. Smith’s pin factory is just a re-hashing of Al-Ghazali, who used the example of a needle factory to illustrate the same point. The pin doesn’t have a single maker, but twenty-five persons involved; these are all collaborating in the absence of a central planner. Adam Smith changed Al-Ghazali’s view that markets work because people like to co-operate to the view that market participants are only interested in selfish gain.  (Just how much of Smith was borrowed from Al-Ghazali and Al-Tusi is unclear from Graeber’s account, and he doesn’t make explicit claims here, but this is definitely one of those “this is why we can’t have nice things” with finger pointed at Americans.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Christendom, things were quite different. Markets came quite late and merchants as a profession were shunned by the church. All of Europe was a checkerboard of baronies and church holdings, with constant conflict reshaping the borders.</p>

<h1>The great capitalist empires</h1>

<p>After a long shift away from bullion, the age of exploration coincided with a reversion to money     Partly due to the influx of gold and silver from the new world. </p>

<p>During the enlightenment, an interesting trend: the dominance of bullion as a logical continuation of conservation laws coming from physics. “Newtonian economics” suggests that money cannot be created or destroyed, and that it needs an intrinsic anchor for its value. This wasn't really a consideration until the renaissance. </p>

<p>Locke himself advocated for this Gold Standard, which led to financial troubles. Hobbes meanwhile promulgated the natural selfishness of people and necessity for social contacts. </p>

<p>From this point onward, Graeber’s writing really becomes unbearable. His bias is too apparent.</p>

  <p>It is the secret scandal of capitalism that at no point was it organized primarily around free labor. The conquest of the Americas began with mass enslavement then gradually settled into debt peonage, African slavery and indentured service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does concede that the world is better today, but at a cost, making asinine comparisons between slavery and modern wage labor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no doubt that progress has produced an unprecedented improvement on the lives of billions over the last 250 years. But it's also unclear to me whether all of these improvements can be tied to capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The beginning of something to be determined…</h1>

<p>Nixon gets blamed for a lot of terrible things, including Vietnam. Is this fair, given that he inherited the war?</p>

<p>So many tropes! The US supposedly uses its military power to terrorize the world. US bonds are actually tribute, not loans. Many of his claims reek of edge-lordship, others come off sounding like conspiracy theories. China is apparently trying to turn the US into a client state. By giving tribute and lavish gifts to its clients, China has previously turned its nemeses into dependents. </p>

<p>Yeah, okay, maybe. I’m torn!</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>“Digital’s overwhelming superiority initially renders analog alternatives worthless, but over time the perception of value shifts and when the honeymoon with a particular technology ends we are more readily able to judge its true merits and shortcomings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very wordy, this is definitely a book to skim. The gist is that we’ve been overzealous about digitizing everything, and now analog is making a comeback in some areas. The book is a straightforward walkthrough of a few domains where this has been happening. The author does a good job of not sounding too crotchety, which is very easy to do in books like these. But this book has basically no insights. It’s more a summary of ideas that are all in the air.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The author presents a semi interesting study on Moleskine, colored by the character who helped cofound the company. There is indeed something that feels inherently good about taking paper notes. But not much insight beyond this. </p>

<p><strong>Board games</strong>: Turns out people are social! And the trend in video gaming is towards solo or online multiplayer, where you are fundamentally alone in a room. In contrast, with board games you're together with a bunch of friends and there's a lot more happening than just the game!</p>

<p><strong>Retail stores</strong> are still important. No surprises again, that Apple and other maintain store presence and support. And bookstores are a good example of tactile scanning and easy previews. Conspicuously absent are libraries. </p>

<p><strong>Work</strong>: As far as I can tell this is where the author complains about tech displacing blue collar jobs. Sadly, even vinyl pressers are going to be automated if the market grows. You'll need CNC experience not operators. </p>

<p><strong>Education</strong>: Attempts to reform education have all been made with advents in new technology. And so far the traditional school classroom approach seems to be giving best results. This is a good reminder for me to ensure that my daughter ends up in a tech-free classroom. I found this quote to be oddly satisfying, and felt sorry for Thrun</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Thrun predicted that MOOCs would be so distributive that in 50 years only ten institutions in the world would provide higher education and his would be one of them. Apparently a lesson about Icarus’s journey to the sun wasn't included on the Udacity syllabus.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the idea that camp Walden doesn't allow any tech for its campers.</p>

<p>Overall, this book could easily be compressed into a 10 minute article. I found no new ideas in this book, just an occasional head nod: confirmation.</p>

    <title>The Circle by Dave Eggers</title>

      <div>
        <p>The Circle is a thinly veiled parable for, well, Big Tech. At base this book suggests what can happen when high modernism goes too far in the 2010 version of tech. </p>

<p>In some ways, the book feels dated. Even the most cynical observer today will agree that even Facebook is concerned with privacy, even if mainly to mitigate bad PR. Meanwhile the Circle is unabashedly techno utopian, extremely brash. I bet in 2014 when the book came out, it was culturally truer than it feels today. </p>

<p>The Circle slogans are especially on the nose: “All that happens must be known”, “To heal we must know. To know we must share.” And PartiRank? Ha! “Secrets are lies, privacy is theft,  sharing is caring”. I think Eggers is going for the 1984 vibe, but it’s just a little over the top.</p>

<p>Mercer’s antler art commodification episode was pretty effective. The whole Instagram influencer business Mae fell into is prescient. I don't think influencers ousting celebrities was as much of a trend at the time of writing. </p>

<p>Completing the circle feels analogous to building Communism, and a stark reminder that any ideology that tramples over your family and friends is probably bad news. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed the twist in the end. It was so well done from the moment that “Mae knew what she had to do” to Mae’s supposed aversion of the apocalypse, to the ultimate reveal of whose side she ultimately landed on. Other than the twist, the plot was predictable but immensely addictive anyway. I breezed through this book, but it definitely felt like junk food. Big thanks Mr. P for sending it to me!</p>

        <p>I’ve never read Gaiman before, but his various works have frequented my to-read list. I wasn’t too thrilled by Sandman, but misattributed that feeling to the graphic novel medium. I abandoned this collection midway since the stories were often really boring or weirdly sexual. Even the best ones weren’t especially memorable or original. At first I optimistically found this unevenness appealing, like playing roulette. Half way through, I decided to cut my losses.</p>

<p>One of the better stories was hidden in the introduction, but was basically a riff on Picture of Dorian Gray. I also found “Troll”, “Chivalry”, “Queen of Knives” and “Shoggoth” to be entertaining but not memorable. Other stories were just bad, like “Goldfish Pool”, and “White Road”, and “Changes”.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Cass suggested I check out The Right It by Alberto Savoia. This book is an ode to an idea: do as much as you can to vet an idea before committing a lot of time and energy on it. In other words, become as confident as possible in product-market fit before spending a lot of resources building even the first version. I strongly agree with the sentiment of the book, and have seen product and research teams fail for this exact reason. That said, it’s quite easy to condense into a substantially smaller format, and I might recommend that (if available) rather than reading the entire book.</p>

<p>Most new ventures fail. Savoia encourages founders to be brutally honest with themselves, make their hypotheses explicit and quantified, and then find clever ways to quickly and cheaply validate them. The steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Come up with an idea (eg. sell old sushi at a discount).</li>
<li>Develop a Market Engagement Hypothesis (eg. A lot of people who want to eat healthy and who like sushi can’t afford to eat it regularly, because sushi tends to be quite expensive. If we can find a way to make sushi as affordable as other fast food, a lot of fast-food patrons will choose sushi over less healthy alternatives.)</li>
<li>Quantify (2) with an X% of Y will do Z. (eg. At least 20% of packaged-sushi eaters will try Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)</li>
<li>Instantiate (3) with a specific, easily testable idea that gets people to put down money (eg. At least 20% of students buying packaged sushi at Coupa Café today at lunch will choose Second-Day Sushi if it’s half the price of regular packaged sushi.)</li>
<li>Actually run the experiment in (4) using a variety of techniques.</li>
<li>Collect your own data from the experiment in (5).</li>
<li>Compare the data with your hypothesis. If the results are close to the hypothesis, you are on the right track. If they are way off, might be time to throw in the towel.</li>
<li>If things look promising, do a few more runs of (4) - (7).</li>
<li>Ultimately make the decision whether to build it, drop it, or make changes to your plan based on what you learned.</li>
</ol>

<p>Savoia describes a bunch of techniques that may be interesting to apply and riff on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fake door technique: placing a facade of a product and seeing how people engage in it. Will they engage? (eg. A landing page for a website that asks for an email address)</li>
<li>Pinnochio technique: pretending that a dummy object is actually real (eg. The Palm founder who pretended a block of wood was a PDA)</li>
<li>Infiltrator technique: negotiate with a store to show your prototype on their shelves for a limited time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve seen focus groups and traditional user research fail in the exact way that Savoia describes: lack of skin in the game on the part of research participants.</p>

        <p>I’ll admit, I only got about 20% through this book when I decided to abandon it.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the world building somewhat, but it felt like a really cut-and-dry Tolkien-esque fantasy book without much originality. I’m not sure why it seems to have such great critical acclaim. The character development is what I found weakest. The protagonist Kvothe (perhaps from Kavod?) seems to just be perfect at everything, and the complete center of attention. None of the other characters feel at all developed. </p>

<p><a href="https://chimaeraspeaks.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/kvothe-a-mary-sue-case-study/">This review</a> seems to mirror my sentiments directly. Enough said.</p>

        <p>I think it was A that originally turned me on to Geoff Berner’s existence. At the very least, he gave me the book (thanks!) Berner exists at the tenuous intersection of musician, comedian, and apparently author! I went to a klezmer show in Seattle for which he was one of the openers, and can vouch for him as a pretty good accordionist, and a pretty funny guy (although I still can’t quite tell if he’s serious about his politics). After reading, I can also confirm that Geoff Berner is a pretty good author.</p>

<p>This book is unlike anything I’ve ever read. It reminds me of looking at a subject through a kaleidoscope, or through a series of funhouse mirrors, or maybe that parable about the blind men and the elephant. Except with less arguing.</p>

<p>At its core, this book paints a portrait of a complex protagonist, so-called “DD” from Berner’s bohemian musician crew. He does an excellent job of convincingly channeling his various friends and acquaintances in his quest. Are these people real? I don’t know, but I’ve venture to guess heavily based on existing people and not conjured from thin air. Anyway, the way Berner writes them in is done convincingly, giving each one of them a distinct style and a manner of speaking. Sometimes these characters speak directly at him as if in an interview setting, other times they take turns to paint a vignette.</p>

<p>In some ways, I was reminded of Foobar, the Canadian Cult Classic film. Maybe because many of the characters are in some undeniable sense lowlifes, but in another, profoundly vulnerable and human.</p>

    <title>Range by David Epstein (audio)</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I learned of David Epstein through his interview with <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02019/jul/22/timefulness/">NonProphets</a>, a podcast I enjoy listening to. He had featured one of the generalist podcast hosts in the segment about super forecasters, and came off as super interesting. I had just committed to sorting my reading list by least recent publish date, biasing it towards works that have stood the test of time. But looking over my options in Audible, I kept coming back to Range.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was worth it, although it took me longer to get through than I expected. Partly I’m reading too many books at once, and partly it got a little slow towards the middle and I lost interest when it covered some familiar territory (eg. Superforecasting).</p>

<p>It’s hard to summarize the book in a sentence, since it tries to integrate learnings from many people from many disparate fields into a coherent narrative. </p>

<p>Savants and other specialists do really well in areas with well defined rules: <strong>“kind”</strong> domains. Examples include games like Go and Chess, and answering trivia questions answer to which is well known. Kind problems have robust statistical regularities. But most real world problems are <strong>“wicked”</strong>: many complex considerations, many variables, and no scenario is quite like the next.</p>

<p><strong>Dark horses</strong>: Making an impact in a novel field is inherently inefficient. You can’t just wake up one day and decide “I’m going to change this field”, and follow a narrow path to do that. Hundreds of people have already tried doing this. A more circuitous route is more likely to yield something novel. Rather than obsessively focusing on a narrow topic, creative achievers tend to have broad interests. In a study, vast majority of successful people followed a circuitous path to get to where they got, but believed that “most people don't do it this way”. Dark horses don't worry about falling behind or comparing themselves to peers. Instead they optimize for match quality. Examples of successful people that take winding paths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frances Hesselbein, Girl Scouts</li>
<li>Vincent Van Gogh</li>
<li>Knight, founder of Nike</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gunpei Yokoi</strong> is my new hero. He started Nintendo's electronics division and instilled the company with “Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology”. Yokoi held that toys and games do not necessarily require cutting edge technology; novel and fun gameplay are more important. He suggested that expensive cutting edge technology can get in the way of developing a new product.</p>

<p><strong>Animals are cool</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is stupid to claim that birds are better than frogs because they see farther, or that frogs are better than birds because they see deeper. The world of mathematics is both broad and deep, and we need birds and frogs working together to explore it.” — Freeman Dyson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A finer hierarchy than the binary (foxes, birds, generalists) vs (hedgehogs, frogs, specialists) dichotomy is the hybridization of the two into “polymaths“ or t-shaped people. Not sure about the use of the polymath term though.</p>

<p>It gets even better when you combine the animals you like into one super animal: a flying, actively open minded t-shaped fox with dragonfly eyes. Creepy!</p>

<p><strong>Desirable difficulties</strong>: the idea that learning requires effort. No pain no gain. And as a teacher, you should be creating situations where students are subjected to struggle. This means avoiding excessive hint giving. With too many hints and shortcuts you risk trading deep understanding for expedient monkey business. Speaking of which, really impressive study about macaques memorizing a pattern under various hint giving conditions. Super relevant to some of my current work. </p>

<p><strong>Generation effect</strong>: merely attempting to produce an answer to a question before getting a hint or the correct answer has been shown to result in better recall results. </p>

<p><strong>Child care pro tip</strong>: don't sweat skills that all children will learn, like reading or walking. To impart lasting academic benefits, teach open  skills scaffolding later knowledge. Eg. Hunt for and connect contextual clues to understand what they read. </p>

<p><strong>Cross-disciplinary sleeping beauties</strong>: Papers that include references from two journals that have never been cited from the same paper before (indicating a high degree of cross-disciplinarily)</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially duds</li>
<li>Published in less prestigious journals</li>
<li>Are more likely to become smash hits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Analogies are super powerful</strong>. Apparently Johannes Kepler relied really heavily on analogies for developing his laws of planetary motion. Kepler’s train of thought fancifully reproduced by the author is super enlightening.  The benefit of analogy is that you can more easily take the outside view (Kahneman). “Evaluating an array of options before letting intuition reign is a trick for the Wicked world.”</p>

<p><strong>Carter racing case study</strong> shows that people often to make decisions based on incomplete information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_geology_software">https://www.academia.edu/20358932/Carter_racing_case</a>. In a brilliant twist, the case is modelled after the <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle">Challenger Disaster</a>.</p>

<p>One critique: it’s easy to create a compelling narrative by cherry picking facts. Certainly there are successful hedgehogs, and some child prodigies do change their field. Mozart, for example.</p>

    <title>Timefulness by Marcia Bjornerud (audio)</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I heard the author’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_generation_sustainability">Long Now talk</a> and thought she did an excellent job. The book did not disappoint.</p>

<p>Most people, myself included, lack a scientific foundation for understanding complex issues like climate change. As a result, discourse around the issue is split into either denial (right) and panic (left). Both are negative, paralyzing emotions.  I’d rather find a constructive middle path. </p>

<p>Backpacking together through the canyons of the Pariah, I watched the landscape with a sense of heightened curiosity. Dad and I had front row seats to observe nature’s processes at work: rivers carving deeper and deeper into slot canyons, erosion’s cleaver splitting gigantic sandstone faces in twain. In a place like the Vermillion Cliffs, you can really feel the Earth’s sovereignty. We are ants. </p>

<p>How might we bring this feeling of scientific curiosity and majestic awe to more people?</p>

<p>Here’s an interesting analogy to kick the book off:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microscope to see small things</li>
<li>Telescope to see far away things</li>
<li>Geology to “see” long ago things</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all the book is short and merely serves to whet the appetite. The author starts with a historical background, goes on to explain some of the science and provide a quick chronology of the Earth (a condensation of her already condensed course), and ends with a discussion about climate change and the future. It’s quite dense in many sections. In general, the author packs a ton of content into a short book, and I learned a huge amount.</p>

<p>Geology is a new science. Our fundamental understanding of plate tectonics can be traced to just 1965. It’s also a cross-disciplinary science featuring "whole brain thinking" and leaning heavily on visualization. Indeed, there’s a whole world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyrd">geology visualization software</a> which I have yet to explore. </p>

<p>High level overview of earth's life as we know today. </p>

<ul>
<li>Cenozoic: 66 - 0 Ma (<strong>M</strong>illion years <strong>a</strong>go)</li>
<li>Mesozoic: 252 - 66 Ma</li>
<li>Paleozoic: 541 - 252 Ma</li>
<li>Precambrian: 4600 - 541 Ma</li>
</ul>

<p>Right off the bat, Marcia injects some pessimism. We used to be citizens, she laments, now are mere consumers. We used to support long term projects like national parks. Now we view them as a tax burden. Do we?</p>

<p>Tons of interesting people I know very little about: <strong>James Hutton</strong>, father of modern geology, first coined the term “deep time” in the 18th century. <strong>Charles Lyell</strong>, building on Hutton’s work eventually inspired Charles Darwin. </p>

<p>There’s a debate between two schools of thought, one represented by the 3 great men above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gradualism (Uniformitarianism) - slow incremental changes, such as erosion, created all the Earth's geological features.</li>
<li>Catastrophism - the Earth has largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Age of the earth</strong>: In 1897, Lord Kelvin, refuting Darwin’s estimate of 300 million years, ultimately settled on an estimate that the Earth was 20–40 million years old. This was based on heat equations that didn’t take into account radiation. Substantially later, Arthur Holmes, father of modern geochronology, developed carbon dating techniques. The oldest Archean rocks he found were 1.6 billion years old. The latest estimate is that earth is 4.5 billion years old.</p>

<p>Interesting balance between erosion and accretion. The Himalayas accrete quickly, but also erode quickly, and the two processes mostly cancel each other out (growing very slowly). The total mass of earth crust in river basins around Himalayas is greater than that of the mountain range itself. </p>

<p><strong>Volcano formation</strong>: Also interesting is the role of water in the formation of volcanoes. Water gets into the earth’s crust underneath oceans. As the porous waterlogged basalt cools and descends into the magma, the water causes the melting point to decrease. As the rock melts and escapes upward from the pressure, it forms volcanoes. This is how New Zealand formed and many other atolls. </p>

<p><strong>Seafloor spreading</strong>: When volcanos erupt, molten iron comes up to the surface. These iron crystals are pulled into alignment by the Earth’s magnetic field, just like a compass needle is pulled towards magnetic north. Once the basalt cools completely into solid rock, the alignment of the iron minerals is fixed. Thus, patterns on the sea floor preserve a permanent record of the strength and direction of Earth’s magnetic field at the time the rocks were formed. (This is so cool!)</p>

<p>Natural CO2 capture mechanism (part of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_impacts_of_climate_change">carbon cycle</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li>Volcanic exhalation causes CO2 emissions</li>
<li>Mixing with water vapour, it forms H2CO3</li>
<li>This dissolves crust rocks over time.</li>
<li>These form CaCO3 which is carried by rivers into the oceans.</li>
<li>Organisms use this for building shells.</li>
<li>When they die, their remains form limestone in the sea floor, sequestering the carbon in (1).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Slowing rotation</strong>: Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation.</p>

<p>A large section of the book is dedicated to history and chronology of the Earth. Here are some fascinating milestones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Oxidation Event (GOE), 2400 million years ago (Ma). formerly water was oxygen free which meant all sorts of ions could float in it freely including iron. After GOE, this changed and oxygen infusion bonded with Fe+ causing rust to sink down into the ocean floor.</li>
<li>Boring Billion, 1.8 Ga - 0.8 Ga. Not many changes to life, earth, etc. Single celled organisms only.</li>
<li>Snowball Earth (theorized), 0.7 Ga. Earth's surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen. Likely due in part to the albedo effect: the cooler it gets the more ice and snow there is on the Earth’s surface. So more sun is reflected and it gets even cooler.</li>
<li>Fascinating to think about: 1.5 billion years in the future the earth won't be habitable to any life since the sun will have warmed enough to boil the oceans.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background rate of extinction</strong>: Surprising way to think about extinctions in aggregate. This is generally slow and continuous but accelerated during periods of mass extinctions. The dinosaur asteroid wiped out 85% of life living on land. Apparently today we're seeing 1000x the base extinction rate. </p>

<p><strong>Anthropocene</strong>: Coined in 2002 (I thought much later) as a new epoch dating from when humans have had large impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems. </p>

<p>I think we in the PNW are lucky and won’t be directly affected by climate change. But what I think will matter is its secondary effect on political stability and human migration. It's going to deepen existing conflicts and create new pressure. Including what I think is most likely cause of human extinction still: global nuclear war. </p>

<p><strong>Why do ice ages occur</strong>: Known as Milankovitch cycles, a few variables change in a periodic manner:
1. Orbital shape (from nearly circular to slightly elliptical), primarily due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn)
2. Axial tilt (21-24 deg with period of 41000 years) and variations in Earth’s orbit around the sun.
3. Axial precession (I don’t fully understand this yet).</p>

<p><strong>Human emissions</strong>: 500 gigatons (GT) of carbon emitted by humans. 25% of that was since 2000. And the rate of our emissions is still increasing. Currently it’s at about 10 GT per year. </p>

<p>I like that Ygrassil made an appearance here too, most recently encountered in Hyperion. Not sure how it fits really, but the author went on a bit of a tangent towards the end, floating some  possibly <a href="https://littlefreelibrary.org/">inauthentic Iroquois legends</a>, and the Norse concept of <a href="https://www.peps.org/">Wyrd</a>.</p>

<p>This book had a lot of facts packed into a small package (short listen). Two main directions I’d like to go into:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A bit more into geological visualizations and making things more accessible to the layperson
\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt;\&lt; HEAD</p>

    <title>Yes Brain by Siegel and Bryson</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Yes Brain is a parenting book. This immediately means several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s extremely repetitive.</li>
<li>It sports branding. “Yes Brain™ – good. No Brain – bad”. </li>
<li>This is strictly necessary because parents are chronically sleep deprived and can’t focus for more than five minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the overall framework within which the book operates:</p>

<p>Children are born with a fully developed “downstairs brain” (roughly aka limbic system, lizard brain, system one), which controls involuntary response. As they grow, they are developing their “upstairs brain” (cortex, system two), in charge of higher level thought. So as children develop, many of their reactions are driven by system one. The parent’s role is to help develop system two. This means going from a predominantly reactive stimulus-response mode to “response flexibility”: being able to choose how to respond to a stimulus.</p>

<p>I find this to be a useful framework in general. All but the most enlightened meditators could use a bit more response flexibility. The most useful parts of this book describe strategies for explaining what this might look like to young children. Unfortunately for me, most examples in the book focus on 5, 8, 13 year olds. One of the most approachable frameworks is based on colors, which my toddler has yet to learn. So I think we have a prerequisite to fill first!</p>

<p>The green zone is a state where response flexibility is maximized. The red zone is a tantrum or lack of control. The blue zone is withdrawal after a pattern of bad feedback. The parental role is to expand the green zone, make children spent more time there, and make returning to green faster. The authors suggest teaching the model to the kids as well to be able to talk about it, and spend some time discussing what that would look like through fairly insightful comics.</p>

<p>Other things I liked included some Stoically inspired advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>There’s an explicit discussion of walking children through tough times without coddling them. In the dismal language of the authors, it’s about finding the “goldilocks balance” between “pushin’” and “cushin’”.</li>
<li>Reframing when kids misbehave. It may be useful to treat this as a form of communication. See it as a call for help rather than them acting out and making things hard for you.</li>
<li>Present difficult situations as “which struggle do you prefer?”. Seems handy to reframe pain as a learning experience.</li>
<li>Try on the outside view to learn to get some emotional distance from the problem at hand. They have a great analogy  of being a player player vs. being a spectator.</li>
<li>For empathy, it’s useful to practice in children’s books: What is the person feeling right now?</li>
</ul>

<p>Random things I disliked:</p>

<ul>
<li>The authors reject any external measuring sticks. A lot of the book emphasized process over results to such an extreme that it conflates extrinsic plenty with intrinsic poverty. In my mind, you should aim for both.</li>
<li>Let’s sprinkle in <strong>neuroscience</strong> to make the book sound more scientistic! Name-dropping the connectome adds nothing, but makes me more annoyed.</li>
<li>Conveniently, the authors provide a “Yes Brain Refrigerator Sheet”, a built-in summary of the book. Sadly it is very bad and doesn’t include the actual good parts of the book.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good parts of this book provide some interesting strategies for teaching stoicism and mindfulness to young children. Perhaps in a few years, I’ll revisit one of its many clones.</p>

    <title>Diamond Age by Stephenson (audio)</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>It's official: I'm on a science fiction kick! It's been a while since I
read Stephenson. It's not that I don't like reading long books, I do. It's just
a question of bang for the buck. Diamond Age stood out because of the
Illustrated Primer, which is relevant to my interests in education, and
Young Ladies, one of which I have the pleasure to be raising. And it wasn't too
long.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed it. The world building was especially compelling: a few
hundred years into the future, an earthbound humanity has balkanized into
tribes. These are not geographically bound but global, with enclaves in every
major city. This strikes me as both interesting as a concept, and plausible as a
way for our already fragile multiculturalism to unravel more fully. </p>

<p>As Diamond Age is a Stephenson book, there are many concrete tech-related ideas
that are worth mentioning.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Matter Compiler - a way to synthesize matter of any kind. At seemingly
arbitrarily large scales if you have the funds. (Incidentally, I excitedly
mentioned Matter Compilers in a recent tweet, comparing 3D printing to Matter
Compilers and got roasted for it by a UW professor!)</p></li>
<li><p>Mites - nano-technological robots that can do almost anything. Very much
indistinguishable from magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Neo-Victorians - a tribe living with Victorian ideals loyal to some vestigual
British monarchy headed by Queen Victoria II: hierarchy, order, aristocracy.
They have a social structure and dukes most of which graduate from careers as
successful entrepreneurs.</p></li>
<li><p>The Illustrated Primer - an interactive book designed for a Neo-Victorian
princess to have an “interesting” childhood so that she grows up to make a
dent on the world. The Primer is both adaptive and personalized, and is at the
core of Diamond Age.</p></li>
<li><p>Ractors - Remote Actors that are instrumented in a way that allows them to do
a very advanced form of voice and motion capture.</p></li>
<li><p>Cheveleens: electromechanical horse-robots often used by Neo-Victorians as
transportation. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a nearly 30 year old book, I'm surprised at how well it's aged. Written in
1996, most aspects come off as very modern, alluding to a distributed web and
distributed ledgers. Brain-computer interfaces are pervasive in the story, and
continue to remain a speculative and illusive area of research.  Some of the
tech has aged poorly, but this is more endearing than annoying. Data is stored
on tape drives, large amounts of it is expressed in gigabytes.</p>

<p>If I was to edit Diamond Age, I'd skip the computer science education parts.
Nell's Illustrated Primer adventures in Castle Turing rely on thinly veiled
analogies that aren't especially insightful.  Wordy passages compare zeros and
ones to two sorts of links in a chain. Stephenson literally explains ASCII
codes. To someone that knows these concepts well, it's boring. To someone that
doesn't, I think it would be boring too. I was distracted by the endless
metaphors between orgies and distributed computing -- typical Stephenson.
Group sex is considerably more entertaining to read and write about than
networking.</p>

<p>Overall, the book felt stronger viewed as a world building exercise rather
than a coherent work of fiction. This despite the some really colorful
characters and an engaging story overall. Some of my favorites were Lord
Finkel-McGraw, Carl Hollywood, Judge Fang, and Dr. X, and the narrator's
entertaining delivery helped. Other major characters start off interesting, but
transform into nagging loose ends: what happened to Nell's guardian Constable
Moore? And to her friends Elizabeth and Fiona?</p>

<p>The plot jumps in ways that force the reader to fill in the gaps, and the
traverse between Nell's reality and the world of the Illustrated Primer can be
disorienting. But if memory serves, this is not unlike Stephenson's other books.
Snow Crash comes to mind. The Drummers, the First Distributed
Republic and other crypto-adjacent tribes were the most mysterious and difficult
to understand elements of the story. Not unlike real life, I might add! </p>

<p>The ending is ambiguous but still satisfying. I can't help but wonder: was the
primer comissioned deliberately to subvert the world order by Finkel-McGraw?</p>

    <title>Hyperion by Dan Simmons (audio)</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I attempted Hyperion a decade or so ago, but couldn't get into it. If I recall,
I found the introduction obscure and difficult to follow and gave up.
However, after many of my friends raved about it, I gave it another shot, and
really loved it.</p>

<p>Set in a far, post-Earth, space-faring future, the Hyperion universe is really
compelling. A core group of planets is run by a giant corporation with
relatively little opposition from rebellious factions. Interstellar FTL travel
is commonplace. Everyone seems to be basically human, but there are really fun
variations. I especially enjoyed the templars and their treeships, giant living,
space-traveling trees like Yggdrasil, which initially housed the party bound for
Hyperion.</p>

<p>The book itself unfolds as a thrilling mystery set in this wonderful universe.
Narratively, it's modeled after the Canterbury Tales. A rag-tag group of
pilgrims each tells his story en-route to their destination. The stories are the
best part. Each one stands on its own, and the fact that they are all set in the
same universe, and are all about one planet make it feel like you're hearing
each blind man's description of the elephant in turn.</p>

<p>All of the stories are about Hyperion and the Shrike, but more importantly, are
very emotionally moving. I found the Catholic priest storyline to be totally
gut-wrenching, but that was just the beginning. My favorite by far was Saul
Weintraub's daughter Rachel, aging backwards. This might be my personal bias: I
too am the Jewish father of a young daughter. But more likely, it's incredibly
well written. Sauls struggles with God and the problem of theodicy in a way that
is far more heartfelt than any theoretical treatise on the subject. The final
story told by the Consul about his grandfather Merin's is also great, and the
conversation with dolphins "scene" is incredible. There is so much more there,
though: romantic implications of time dilation, the chronological complexity in
the narrative, flashbacks and flashes forward are masterfully written. Kassad's
and Silenius' stories are also excellent and stand on their own, although less
compelling than the aforementioned in my opinion. Lamia's tale was emotionally
weaker and leaned too heavily on AI mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>Each sub-story is so diverse, and spawns so many questions, it feels nearly
impossible to integrate into a final product. I shouldn't be surprised at the
cliffhanger ending. I did find that the book lost some steam towards the
very end, but this is excusable given that Hyperion is the first of four highly
acclaimed books. Whether or not the series itself wraps up coherently, the way
to read this book is to enjoy the Hyperion universe and each of the pilgrim's
tales for their brilliance in their own right.</p>

    <title>Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <blockquote>
  <p>I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. – Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of this book agrees emphatically with this Twain quote. Fundamentally,
Illich believes that "universal education through schooling is not feasible". 
Did you know that "schole", the origin of the word "school" and "школа", is the
greek word for leisure? The book is written as a collection of essays. Overall,
Illich is an Anarchist, and the essays are too radical for me temperament.</p>

<h2>Why We Must Disestablish School</h2>

<p>A scathing, radical critique of modernity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medical treatment is mistaken for healthcare, social work for the improvement
  of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national
  security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity,
  independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the
  performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illich also seems to think that schools are flawed because they won't lead to
equal outcomes for rich and poor. But he seems to discount the fact that a poor
but schooled person would presumably be better off than a poor unschooled one. A
rising tide lifts all boats.</p>

<p>One area where I agree is to "detach competence from curriculum", and make it
taboo to ask people where they studied and how they came to have their skills.
Another interesting argument is that "most learning happens casually", in the
way that children learn a language, or even adults do it situationally (rarely
in language class).</p>

<p>Illich strongly advocates for apprenticeship models, arguing that "all education
was complex, lifelong, and unplanned". He gives examples of making schooling
more effective by taking into account personalized context: "Paolo Freire [...]
discovered that any adult can begin to read in a matter of fourty hours if
the first words he deciphers are charged with political meaning."</p>

<p>He suggests opening the market to for students to find appropriate teachers for
them. Even more intriguingly, here's a startup idea. I've redacted some
antiquated parts (the essay is written in 1970):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each man [...] could identify himself to a computer, indicating the book,
  article, film, or recording on which he seeks a partner for discussion [...] and
  arrange for a meeting with others who recently had taken the same initiative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine doing this today, restoring coffee shops as <a href="/books/palaces-for-the-people">social
infrastructure</a> for <a href="/books/the-coffee-house-a-cultural-history/">intellectual
conversation</a>.</p>

<p>School, Illich argues, is divisive, splintering society into the schooled (white
collar) and unschooled (blue collar). Education becomes unworldly and the world
becomes noneducation.</p>

<h2>Phenomenology of School</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The school system is a modern phenomenon, as is the childhood it produces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinatingly, until the Second Vatican Council in 1962, each child was
instructed that a Christian reaches moral discernment and freedom at the age of
seven.</p>

<p>I think Illich unfairly claims that adults tend to romanticize their schooling,
attributing their learning to a beloved teacher, not giving enough credit to
teachers that really inspire their pupils, spot talent, provide encouragement.
Surely many pupils end up pursuing higher ed in a field because of a high school
teacher.</p>

<p>But he fairly critiques the institution of school for giving a single teacher
too many roles: "custodian, preacher/moralist, and therapist".</p>

<p>Overall I find his take super idealistic. I wonder if he had kids? The fact that
school provides childcare is like a super important aspect of it for most
families, and increasingly so as more women are in the workforce.</p>

<p>I got through the third essay, but it was a slog. Overall, there are interesting
tidbits but the overall tone is so anarchic, marxist and idealistic, I found it
a draining read.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Asimov attempts to create a real-world technology chronology. This reminds me of
the tech trees found in strategy games like Civilization. This encyclopedic tome
is not a book you would normally read cover to cover, and I'll be honest: I'm
only less than a quarter of the way through. I read from the beginning of time
to 1519 (500a), just to get a feeling for the book, and really learned a lot.
Some surprising things about early human history:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dizzying array of horse-related inventions: metal stirrups giving more
stability to the rider, iron horseshoes to let horses travel further,
horse collars to increase pulling capacity by 5x.</li>
<li>The perfect plow, called the Moldboard or Turnplow had a vertical knife-blade
that cut deep into the earth. Useful for damp, moist ground, led to increase
in carrying capacity.</li>
<li>Telling time, from water clocks to more accurate weight-powered
mechanical clocks, to spring powered watches that could be much smaller.</li>
</ul>

<p>But also, let me nitpick a bit. In addition to inventions, the author spends an
inordinate amount of time on geographic discoveries, which feels disconnected
from the rest of the narrative.  Some other "discoveries" are hard to square
with the rest of the content, such as "the rational interpretation of dreams",
first discovered? invented? in 480 BC.</p>

<p>Although an attempt is made to be international, some entries are extremely
Euro-centric. For example, the entry on fermentation is dated 1800 BCE, but
according to Wikipedia, fermentation was actually first done in 6000 BCE in
china. Many other inventions also chronicle explicitly the arrival of the
technology to Europe, such as Gunpowder which is dated 1249 CE but as the entry
admits, was first used to scare Chinese enemies in 1044 CE. The listed date was
when the technology arrived in Europe and was perfected to make serious
weaponry. My last critique is that some of the writing felt stilted and
inconsistent. I imagine that Asimov worked more on the skeleton, and perhaps let
a ghostwriter fill in the details.</p>

<p>Despite some shortcomings, Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery is a
really impressive tome, and a reference book I'll keep close by. I've started on
a summary of the chronology in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lBahJh5UEYEPgamNpyWAaxAQOLO6088nLiBjQW9zr2U/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet
form</a>.
Please help me by filling in the remainder of the spreadsheet for the remaining
500 years (1519 - 2019). My goal is to ultimately generate a visual,
Civilization-style technology tree for this whole book.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The phrase "palaces for the people" comes from Andrew Carnegie. A prolific
philanthropist, Carnegie helped to fund more than 2,500 libraries around the
world.</p>

<p>Initially excited by a systematic, long form look into an issue I care deeply
about, I picked up this book after hearing Eric Klinenberg talk on 99%
Invisible. Reading the book, I found the library-related discussions to be most
coherent, and also found many disparate nuggets that piqued my curiosity,
including many social-minded projects I hadn't heard of before. But overall,
the book's scope is so huge that I think the author failed to conjure a coherent
narrative. In addition, I often found the tone overly didactic and pandering to
a particular audience.</p>

<p>The author draws on a wide variety of authors I've recently become familiar with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robert Putnam (Bowling Alone): social capital has been declining since the
1960s.</li>
<li>Charles Murray (Coming Apart)</li>
<li>Jane Jacobs (The Death and Life of Great American Cities)</li>
<li>James Scott (Seeing Like a State): high modernism and optimization is at odds
with social infrastructure.</li>
<li>Sherry Turkle (Alone Together): we don't talk to each other anymore because of
digital devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprising facts about libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Usage is increasing in the US.</li>
<li>Circulation is led by Seattle in annual book circulation per capita.</li>
<li>Along with Military and First Responders, the most respected institutions.</li>
<li>Used in a wide variety of ways, far more than just lending books
(eg. virtual senior bowling leagues -- take that Robert Putnam)</li>
</ul>

<p>My favorite part included examples of hard infrastructure (eg. electric grid,
sewer system, transit networks, levies) doubling as social infrastructure.  A
levy can double as a walking path. An example is a new project in Manhattan
called the <a href="http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/our-work/all-proposals/winning-projects/big-u">Big
U</a>,
where flood walls will double as gallery and public space.  This is just like
the Richmond Dyke, an embankment which prevents the suburb where I grew up from
flooding. Richmond is below sea level, and situated in a river delta. Also, old
physical infrastructure can be repurposed to be more social. This often happens
with waterfront renovation projects. For example, when the Embarcadero highway
fell in the 1989 SF quake, it was converted into a much better waterfront. In
Seattle and Vancouver, viaducts along the water are being replaced with much
more human-friendly infrastructure. Tons of examples of former rail lines being
turned into vibrant public spaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>New Orleans: Lafitte Greenway</li>
<li>Atlanta: Green Belt</li>
<li>Seattle: Burke Gilman Trail</li>
<li>Portland: Springwater Corridor</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of public spaces, Frederick Law Olmsted and his sons were also
mentioned. This gave me an excuse to look a bit deeper. Like Carnegie, who left
a legacy in libraries, the Olmsteads left their legacy in America's parks.
Olmstead Sr. is considered the father of landscape architecture, and his son FLO
Jr. designed Olmstead Point in Yosemite, one of my favorite places. As it turns
out, the Olmstead brothers <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olmsted_parks_in_Seattle">planned most of Seattle's
parks</a>.</p>

<p>Also interesting discussion about public baths and their role as social
infrastructure. In Finland the public pools help build social cohesion.
Swimming in the same place means you accept other bodies. They are used to meet
neighbors, and even complain to elected representatives. Of course, Finland is
quite demographically homogenous. In contrast, the US had many pool related
battles between blacks and whites during the Civil Rights era. </p>

<p>Among the painful parts of the book hand wringing about the veracity of the
Broken Window Theory. But the conclusion is what really put a nail in the
coffin. Suddenly all of the memes are in full force: Trump is Evil Incarnate.
Tech is to blame for all of the Bay Area's problems. Facebook is The Absolute
Worst. It's not that I disagree with these sentiments, but stop flogging a dead
horse. (Meta: one of the reasons I love books is that they are timeless, and
less about knee-jerk reactions to current events. This is less true for new
releases that have not passed the test of time.)</p>

<p>The author defines Social Infrastructure as "the physical conditions that
determine if social capital can flourish". Immediately my mind went to the
digital equivalent: Social <strong>Digital</strong> Infrastructure. "the <strong>physical</strong>
conditions that determine if social capital can flourish".</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this book cements an idea I've been wrangling with. Over the last
little while, I've attempted a number of projects that try to improve social
discourse online. That they have all failed does not necessarily mean that there
is no hope for systems that try to foster social infrastructure digitally, but I
now believe that my efforts were somewhat misguided. I strongly agree with this
sentiment expressed by the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local face to face interactions are the building blocks of all public life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would have liked to read more about examples of digital infrastructure
intended to impact the real world. Also, why does Meetup have such awful
attrition? I propose a law:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Law of Meetup Attrition</strong>: the number of people that show up to an event is
  1/3 the number of people that sign up for it. The number of people that sign up
  to an event is 1/30 the number of people in the meetup group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Successful unmentioned examples of social digital infrastructure that come to

    <title>The Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson (audio)</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>As a kid, I read The Odyssey in some canonical translation. That is to say, I
knew it was a classic, and wanted to check the box. I read it quickly and
retained nothing from the experience. When I learned about this new, accessible
translation from Tyler Cowen's interview with the translator, my interest was
piqued.</p>

<p>In an extended intro, Wilson justified the constraints of her translation. I
agreed with her that constraints are fun to work within, and found the specifics
of translating from dactylic hexameter the meter of all homeric epic poems, to
iambic pentameter the usual meter of English classics to be super
interesting. Impressively, she also constrained herself to the same number of
lines as the original. All this while keeping to modern language that isn't
overly flowery or archaic. In her own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But of course, the English of the nineteenth or early twentieth century is no
  closer to Homeric Greek than the language of today. The use of a noncolloquial
  or archaizing linguistic register can blind readers to the real, inevitable, and
  vast gap between the Greek original and any modern translation. My use of
  contemporary language—rather than the English of a generation or two ago—is
  meant to remind readers that this text can engage us in a direct way, and also
  that it is genuinely ancient. My Homer does not speak in your grandparents'
  English, since that language is no closer to the wine-dark sea than your own. I
  have tried to keep to a register that is recognizably speakable and readable,
  while skirting between the Charybdis of artifice and the Scylla of slang.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I loved Claire Danes' reading of the translated poem, and Audible's production,
especially that little blooming musical flourish in the end. I wonder how hard
it was for the producers to be so parsimonious with effects.</p>

<h2>Recurring themes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hospitality</strong>: There's a steady emphasis on hospitality as a way to appease
gods, especially Zeus. There is an element of it being encouraged in general,
and an element of fear: any old beggar may in fact be a god in disguise. It
plays out in the narrative too when the suitors' evil is illustrated in their
disdain for Odysseus disguised as a beggar.</li>
<li><strong>Weaving women</strong>: Every great woman spins cloth, including all noble wives
and most notably Penelope.</li>
<li><strong>Gods concealing as humans</strong>: Athena is often disguised as Mentor,
Telemachus' ally and advisor. The pattern of Gods disguised as familiar people
is super compelling as a narrative device. There are moments in life
when it feels that way, no?</li>
<li><strong>Constant bitching</strong>: Odysseus is constant bitching about how hard his life
is, while his crew is dying left and right. This is odd -- under such dire
circumstances, should he not be glad to be alive?</li>
<li><strong>Metaphors for Dawn</strong>: I really liked all of the descriptions of Dawn. Rosy
fingered, braided, Dawn on her golden throne, bright-throned Dawn.</li>
<li><strong>Awesome monsters</strong>: Polyphemus the cyclops eats Odysseus' crew, Circe the
nymph turns them into swine, The Sirens lure his men to thier doom, Scylla, a
giant six headed sea hydra decimates his ships and Charybdis, a whirlpool
monster, threatens to be his end.</li>
<li><strong>Bards rock</strong>: bards, poets and singers are universally great. They bring the
people to tears, and generally speaking, survive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Answered questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>After sneezing, Russians sometimes say "truth". There is a passage related to
this, and I got curious. Does the Russian tradition come from the Greek?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Apparently</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vickrey">yes</a>.</li>
<li>Athena continually disguises as Mentor, a man in Odysseus entourage. Mentor is
also extremely wise and a great advisor to Telemachus. Is this the origin of
the word? <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Apparently yes</a></li>
<li>Are Phaeacian Phoenicians? There are similarities beyond their names, like
great skill in navigation. I answered this myself since eventually both
appeared in The Odyssey as distinct peoples. However there is some interesting
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/7299720/Homer_s_Phaeacians_and_Phoenician_Bi-lingual_Onomastica.docx">academic
writing</a>
on this: "The onomastic qualities of Phaeacian personal names in book 6-8 of
the Odyssey further indicate that the bard envisioned the Phaeacians as a
fantastical clone of the real-world Phoenicians." </li>
</ul>

<h2>Narrative observations</h2>

<p>The story itself was pretty clear, but I was super confused about Odysseus' side
trip to Hades. I had to read about it separately. The trip was just to talk to a
prophet in order to find out what to do next? Such a needless tangent.</p>

<p>There is some complex structure in the narrative. Big chunks of the story are
narrated by the actors themselves. Odysseus retells part of his story to King
Alcinous (Father of Nausicaa). Telemecus reveals a sparknotes version of The
Iliad when he visits Nestor.</p>

<p>One of the greatest scenes must have been Odysseus confronting the suitors as a
beggar in his own house. It's so vividly written, with great details including
Argos' death. This is apparently the only time the dog is ever mentioned, but it
makes the listener feel as if there's so much more to the story.</p>

<p>Although the narrator is clearly on Odysseus side, his decision to kill all of
the suitors was clearly disproportionate to their crimes. It's easy to imagine
Odysseus as a villan, triply so with the mass strangulation of slave girls that slept
with the suitors, and his vicious torture of Melanthius. </p>

<p>Is this really the end of Odysseus' adventures? As soon as he returns, he must
venture off again to appease Posideon. Sounds like another arduous journey, and
another decade of disappointment for Penelope. Her patience and the ambiguity
with which they reunite is palpable.</p>

    <title>The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The Fifth Season is a well crafted fantasy book, the first of the Broken Earth
trilogy. Each book in the trilogy won a Hugo Award in subsequent years, which is an
unprecedented achievement. But even more importantly, my wife discovered it and
recommended it to me! Overall, I found the book to be very original, but
had a few gripes too. The best parts were the slow reveal and the world
building, but I found the beginning to be boring, and struggled a bit with
identity politics.</p>

<p>Jemisin's world building is very compelling. She created an interesting,
completely original universe based on tectonic plates, the earth itself, and
seismic activity. The earth-like setting is incredibly seismically active, and
some humans have some ability to control this activity, either suppressing
shakes or creating their own. There are also humanoids that appear to be made of
rock, and other interesting fauna. I really liked kirkhusas for some reason. One of the
great things about the way the book is written is that all aspects of the world
reveal themselves very slowly. Two thirds of the way in, I was still confused
about the mechanics of earth manipulation, the politics of the realm, who the
characters really were. I also loved the way that that three distinct story
lines merged into two, then one. </p>

<p>Two aspects that I didn't like are as follows. Firstly, I found the sex towards
the end of the book to be surprising. The first encounter with Inon devolved
into a really a weird scene, and I felt that the whole book risked devolving
into smarmy rom. </p>

<p>Secondly, it is an underdog story that feels a bit too black and white. Those
that control the earth form an underclass, despite their great innate power.
They are subjugated by non-magical people that control them through their
evil, hierarchical bureaucracy. The author does a great job conveying emotions,
especially of the female characters. Their frequent frustration is palpable.</p>

<p>I really wish I didn’t know the identity of the author before reading. This was
inevitable, as her picture prominently features on the inside cover. As a
result, I was distracted by the emphasis on female protagonists and racial
analogies. Even the word "rogga" connotes very directly another racially
derogatory term that has no place on this page. In that political light, I was
somewhat surprised at the revolutionary tone the author sets, especially towards
the end of the book, and particularily in the cryptic ending. I suppose it's a
powerful hook to read the next book in the trilogy.</p>

    <title>Radical Markets by Posner and Weyl</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl"/>
    
    <updated>2019-04-18T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The book Radical Markets is centered on one central premise: **Competitive, free
markets are awesome, but most in reality are either not perfectly competitive,
or insufficiently free**.</p>

<p>Overall, the book covers a lot of ground, proposing solutions to many of
modernity's major questions, from immigration to monopolies to property rights.
I found the tone to be overly enthusiastic, and annoyingly focused on the word
"radical". Although the authors try to provide nuance sometimes, for example
emphasizing that they would like to see their ideas applied gradually and after
small scale testing, it still reads more like a manifesto or a series of
pamphlets than like a coherent book.</p>

<p>That said, I found that the "everything is a market" lens to be pretty
interesting. I disagree with most of the specific implementations that
the authors suggest, partly because they are so specific, partly because they
are so extreme. At the same time, I appreciate that they propose specific policy
rather than general platitudes. We live in interesting times, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton
window</a> is wider today than ever
in my lifetime. It is a good time to try to unbundle the author's ideas and find
the worthy nuggets.</p>

<h2>Auctions for everything, ever</h2>

<p>By the mid 20th century, Henry George was "by far the most famous American
economic writer", having written Progress and Poverty (1879), which sold
millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before
that time. The central idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">Georgism</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>while people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value
  derived from land (often including natural resources and natural opportunities)
  should belong equally to all members of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors take some Georgist ideas and try to apply them with the goal of
reducing inequality. For example, they claim that real estate is not a
competitive market. A particular property may be unique, and thus a sort of
micro-monopoly, despite other supply being available. The authors often cite
holdouts as common roadblocks for developing large infrastructural projects.
While the government could use its power of eminent domain, a private venture to
build a high speed rail line from Seattle to Vancouver would be impossible.</p>

<p>The authors propose a wealth tax on all property, in a form of
<a href="https://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/">Vickrey auctions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every citizen and especially corporation would self-assess the value of assets
  they possess, pay a roughly 7% tax on these values and be required to sell the
  assets to anyone willing to purchase them at this self-assessed price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A wealth tax is a <a href="/simulating-wealth-inequality/">great way to reduce
inequality</a>, but the authors bundle it together
with the above self-evaluation scheme. If you self-evaluate too low in order to
pay less in taxes, you may lose your property to a buyer that has found a great
deal. Conversely, if you self-evaluate too high in order to ensure that you
won't be bought out, you will pay more in taxes.</p>

<p>While this is pareto optimal, the obvious objection in practice is that it may
be rather annoying for residents of North Seattle to suddenly be bought up by
Jeff Bezos for his new private spaceport. I think I'd rather see a world in
which the government is more empowered to take on large public works, and more
agressively uses its power of eminent domain for the common good.</p>

<h2>A market for voting</h2>

<p>What if we treated voting like a market too? Imagine saving up your votes for an
issue you really care about. Why is it that we are so attached to the idea of
one person, one vote?</p>

<p>The authors criticize Likert scales for producing results that tend towards
extremes. This is interesting to me, since a lot of political surveys use likert
scales, as do many HCI studies. I'm a bit confused about this claim, since there
is evidence that likert responders have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-017-1344-2">central
tendency</a>.</p>

<p>Here again, the authors take multiple ideas and bundle them together into a
large package. They introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">Quadratic
Voting</a>, a collective decision
making procedure where participants can indicate how strongly they feel about an
issue.  Logistically, you are given a number of credits that you can allocate to
a set of issues. You can allocate multiple credits per issue if you care more
about it, but <code>votes = sqrt(credits)</code>. The authors found that this leads to a
more realistic breakdown of people's preferences, following what we'd expect: a
normal distribution.</p>

<p>The idea that you have a finite number of credits to allocate to some set of
issues entails trade-offs. To me this artificial scarcity is the main appeal of
the QV idea, since it mirrors finite resources of the real world. However, the
author's insistence that the dropoff should specifically quadratic seemed a bit
odd. Why not exponential? Why not a power other than two?  Maybe this is
discussed in more technical detail in another paper.</p>

<p>I'd love to see some sort of bounded credit allocation scheme used in more
surveys. Partly because this gives people a chance to do an initial allocation,
then think more about trade-offs. This reflects reality in a way to unbounded
surveys do not. The down side is that it's also a lot more annoying to do.</p>

<h2>Everybody gets an immigrant</h2>

<p>Large volumes of migration between countries is a relatively recent phenomenon.
That's because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modernity makes it easier to travel. Even if conditions in a country were
terrible (persecution or economically), it was very hard to leave.</li>
<li>There is a lot more economic inequality between countries. This started to
happen in the colonial era, and continues today.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of this increased movement, and the controversy that immigration has
caused in recent years, the authors propose a truly insane idea. What if
citizens could sponsor migrants from other countries in the same way that they
can sponsor family members? The authors flesh out what this might look like, and
even their own description paints an extremely precarious picture. Sponsor and
invitee would be matched through some kind of agency and meet over a series of
video chats. The sponsor would then be on the hook for finding housing, a job,
and guaranteeing the good behavior of their guest. In exchange, the sponsor
benefits from partaking in cultural exchange, and potential profit by
capitalizing on the guest's low salary. If the guest misbehaves, they are
expelled back to their home country, and their sponsor is reprimanded.</p>

<p>At the end of the discussion, the authors estimate that 1/3 of all Americans
would sponsor an immigrant through this program, based on the insane assumption
that every working age adult would want to participate. This is hilariously
optimistic. Just because something works for the Au Pair program which is very
small scale, specific, and in which the guest lives and works in your own home,
does not mean it will scale to full generality.</p>

<h2>Break up all the corporations</h2>

<p>Institutional investors like Vanguard and Blackrock have huge capital and can
invest in a whole sector, reducing competition within it. Specifically, authors
cite examples of multiple airlines serving the same route with funding from the
same investors causing inflated prices because of cartel-like behaviors.</p>

<p>The authors suggest to only allow institutional investors to invest in one
corporation per industry. but it's kind of unclear as to how to enforce this.
Defining which form is in which industry can be a real challenge. What is a tech
company even, and is "tech" a meaningful industry, or is Google just an ads
company?</p>

<p>I'm sympathetic to one idea that the authors write about, echoing Senator
Warren's recent demands for more government control over startups being acuired
by tech giants. These acquisitions lead to a concentration of power in large
companies, and ultimatley a tendency towards monopoly. The social empire that is
concentrated in Facebook/WhatsApp/Instagram just gives too much data to one
corporation. In addition to providing consumers less choice, especially if the
acquired company's product is sunset, these acquisitions reduce competitive
pressure on the behemoth.</p>

<h2>Release the chains of data serfdom</h2>

<p>Advances in modern AI require mounds of human-created data. ML engineers at tech
companies transform this data into really impressive machine learning models. A
handful of research scientists develop new ML techniques. Only the engineers and
scientists get paid in the process.</p>

<p>In the chapter/pamphlet, the authors, citing Jaron Lanier heavily, argue that
the people that provide data should be adequately compensated. Traditional
statistics would argue that each data point has only a small marginal value. For
any given problem (eg. Face identification), each new labeled face provides
diminishing returns. The authors compellingly argue that many new ML problems
can be trained with the same labeled data, which makes the data itself more
valuable.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good argument, but the main challenge here seems to be
logistical: how do you decide how much to pay people for their data, and how do
you actually pay them? One problem with the idea of paying for all "data work"
is that a lot of user data is organically collected by people using a product,
not explicitly for the demands of a specific Machine Learning problem. If users
were to be asked for explicit data, that would be off-putting. As mentioned in
the book, having a paid contract emphasizes the idea that what you were already
doing for fun is actually work that deserves renumeration.</p>

<p>One thing skimped in the book is that it really depends on what the actual data
is. Google Translate is trained on human translations, which require substantial
translation skill by professional translators, who are very likely underpaid
today. It would make perfect sense for translators to receive commission from
tech companies for using their output to train translation models. In contrast,
face identification is trained on photographs of faces with labels around the
face, which anyone with a pulse can produce.</p>

<p>As an aside: I found the constant analogy between "women’s work", slavery and
serfdom to “data work” to be annoying and misleading. The authors love to
brandish loud colloquialisms like "techno feudalism" and "siren servers". I wish
they would stop! Unlike feudalism, Facebook is not a mandatory, all encompassing
system that controls your work and life. Unlike slavery, data work does not
capitalize at the expense of a specific identity group. Unlike "siren servers",
the lure of social networks can be resisted.</p>

    <title>Seeing Like a State by James Scott</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott"/>
    
    <updated>2019-03-28T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The most succinct version summary of Seeing Like a State this is what has been
called The Authoritarian High-Modernist <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Recipe for Failure</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at a complex and confusing reality</li>
<li>Fail to understand all the subtleties of how the complex reality works</li>
<li>Attribute that failure to the irrationality of what you are looking at,
rather than your own limitations</li>
<li>Come up with an idealized blank-slate vision of what that reality ought to
look like</li>
<li>Argue that the relative simplicity and platonic orderliness of the vision
represents rationality</li>
<li>Use authoritarian power to impose that vision, by demolishing the old reality
if necessary</li>
<li>Watch your rational Utopia fail horribly</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, humanity has clearly benefitted from modern institutions that
scale. Scale requires optimization. Optimization requires simplification.
But overly simplified schemes dehumanify people, converting humans into drones
lacking agency and autonomy. My main question going into this book: how to
strike the right balance?</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the book: Scott goes through many different examples of the
above scheme in practice.</p>

<h2>Scientific Forestry</h2>

<p>Pioneers of modern forestry viewed forests as factories for growing trees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"One should manage the forest so as to guarantee the highest sustained
  financial revenue, when all usable products are calculated in money." –
  Friedrich Wilhelm Pfeil, the first director of the Eberswald Academy of Forestry
  (1856)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led to the unintended consequence of forest dieback. A century later, an
observer wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of the pure stands [of spruce] grew excellently in the first generation
  but already showed an amazing retrogression [decline in yields] in the second
  generation.” – Richard Plochmann, District Chief of the Bavarian Forest Service
  (1968)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>City Planning</h2>

<p>Modern planners believed that city planning can be done abstractly, without any
regard for the specifics of the city's residents.  Le Corbusier's vantage point
is entirely external to the city, completely devoid of cultural context of the
people he was building for. The resulting city was perfect for an average human
that didn't exist. His plans were best seen from an airplane, and his sketches
entering the port on or ship. Le Corbusier's concerns are visual. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Houses are machines for living in." – Le Corbusier (1923)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led to planned cities like Brasilia and Chandigarh. These cities were
visually appealing from abstract vantage points, but not functionally livable.
They worked for people only because of an inevitable departure from the
architect's master plan, molding it to their actual needs.</p>

<p>One anecdote was particularly striking to me. Le Corbusier went so far as to
design plans for Moscow that were judged too radical by the Soviets. Unfazed, he
took the same plans and recycled them to use for central Paris!  In contrast,
Jane Jacobs in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, championed
function over form, and walked in the shoes of a resident of the city.</p>

<h2>Russian Revolution</h2>

<p>Lenin believed that communism must be brought in through violent revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the
  purpose of crushing the oppressors." - Lenin (1917)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He viewed the Vanguard Party as a machine for bringing on communism. Needless to
say, the revolution led to a huge loss of life, and then even more in the
repressions that followed. Conflicts with the Kulaks over collectivisation led
to a terrible decline in quality of life for farmers and workers that Lenin was
trying to help.</p>

<p>Rosa Luxemburg, a Marxist theorist and anti-war activist, and her spiritual
successor Alexandra Kollontai, a Russian Menshevik, had a very different take on
communism. Theirs was a nature-inspired view of social uprisings, strife, and
revolution. This bottom-up view was diametrically opposed to Lenin's top-down
view.</p>

<p>There are striking parallels with Jane Jacobs' critique of Le Corbusier.
Is it a coincidence that in both cases, it is a woman's humanistic, nuanced, and
intuitive tendencies criticizing the iron fisted absolution of a man?</p>

<h2>Agriculture</h2>

<p>Modern farming views the farm as a factory for producing food. The bigger and
more specialized, the better. This trend was present both in the west and in the
east in the early twentieth century, but it is illuminating to see the
differences in approach. This illustrates a point Scott hedges on repeatedly,
that high modernism by itself is not the problem, but requires authoritarianism
to lead to disastrous results.</p>

<p>In America, large industrial farms led to bad outcomes, but these did not lead
to massive famines or millions of deaths. In the east, the sheer scale of the
operation led to disaster. Early Kolhoz were created by dividing whole swaths of
Russia into a grid of 2500 hectare plots, and requiring quotas from each "farm"
without much regard for whether the land was arable or not. Collectivization in
the Soviet Union and China led to large scale famines and millions of deaths.</p>

<p>On the topic of agriculture, Scott explicitly mentioned one feedback loop I
found interesting. Crops were modified to make them more amenable to mechanized
picking. This led to a monoculture and a more fragile crop, and thus to
increased pesticide use.</p>

<h2>Applications to corporations</h2>

<p>One of the major ideas in the book is legibility, the process by which modern
states, over a long period of time, attempt to understand society, simplify it,
and make it more managable. In Scott's own words, to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of
  taxation, conscription, and prevention of rebellion.  Having begun to think in
  these terms, I began to see legibility as a central problem in statecraft. The
  pre-modern state was, in many crucial respects, particularly blind; it knew
  precious little about its subjects, their wealth, their landholdings and yields,
  their location, their very identity. It lacked anything like a detailed “map” of
  its terrain and its people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It struck me that a lot of Scott's critiques apply to corporations just as much
as they do to governments. In many cases, tech companies are in the business of
taking an existing practice and digitizing it.  Companies like Convoy and Cloud
Kitchens, in an attempt to digitize the physical, are implicitly increasing
legibility and imposing the same sorts of potential pitfalls that will be
described in this book.</p>

<p>In particular, this involves the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Understand the physical world</li>
<li>Predict the future state of the physical world</li>
<li>Control the future state of the physical world</li>
</ol>

<p>This is exactly the same sequence of steps that most of the high modernist
examples in this book undertake.</p>

<h2>Recipes for success</h2>

<p>Scott has a few suggestions which I succinctly summarize "be humble". He
explicitly writes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take small steps, observe results, repeat.</li>
<li>Make sure the steps are reversible. The first rule of intelligent tinkering is
to save all the parts. (Aldo Leopold)</li>
<li>Plan for surprises.</li>
<li>Plan on human inventiveness. </li>
</ul>

<p>Scott uses "metis", a Greek word for know-how, or cunning, or chutzpah, to
describe a lot of what's missing in high modernist ideology. Metis refers to the
sorts of things that cannot be taught, but must be practiced, like riding a
bike, playing an instrument. Scott argues this understanding of the practical is
critical for any high modernist scheme, as the scheme is inevitably overly
simplifying, so gaps emerge that need to be filled.</p>

<p>Metis has led to folk discoveries that were done by non-scientific method were
often rediscovered by science in some form and formalized. Scott makes a sort of
prediction that this traditionally derived wisdom is still far ahead of
scientific discovery in some domains, such as poly-cropping for example.</p>

<p>One common theme across all of the high modernist failures is mechamorphism:
everything is a machine. For Le Corbusier, the house was a machine for living
in. For Lenin, the vanguard party was a machine for bringing forth communism.
For practitioners of Forstwissenschaft, forests were factories for making trees,
and farms are factories for making food. It's easy to make fun of, but maybe today's metaphors will be similarly flawed?</p>

<h2>Seeing Like a State and AI</h2>

<p>Speaking of today's metaphors...</p>

<p>In the spirit of Chesterton's Fence, it's worth taking a closer look at
simplifying schemes that we take for granted. They may actually have adverse
side effects. Can we undo them through a better understanding of the things
that came before them?</p>

<p>High modernism often fails because it is overly reductive. I keep wondering: can
we better understand complex, natural domains with modern technology? We've made
really great progress in some areas like speech recognition. Can we apply
AI to better understand complex domains without being overly reductive and
prescriptive? For example, what if we built a gardening AI to take meticulous
care of an organic polyculture farm?</p>

<p>Imagine a future in which a series of complex, domain-specialized AIs have been
created in such domains as gardening and driving. We may well end
up with systems that work super well, but are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">far less legible</a>. What
would the ensuing world look like? I'm imagining self driving cars with emergent
swarming behaviors that look completely terrifying from the sky, but would be
very functional and completely safe (as long as no humans were involved in
driving decisions). I feel that we are very far from such a world, but it's fun
to think about.</p>

    <title>Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Calvino writes in some of the most poetic prose in my recent memory. At times it
borders on obscurity, but often it is beautiful almost beyond words.</p>

<p>Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan stories of the cities he's been to. A handful of
cities are each vividly described in a few paragraphs, and then we return to the
court, where Polo, diplomatic like a dragoman, tends to Khan's whims. </p>

<p>Are all of these cities metaphors for facets of a single city? Are the cities
real? Has Polo even been to them? Are Khan and Polo really communicating
non-verbally, in gestures and dances? Everything has an ethereal feel, and all
of the aforementioned questions are raised by the author himself, and all turn
out to be irrelevant. </p>

<p>At the same time, Calvino captures truths and conveys ideas with the emotional
valence that only good fiction writers can. All the while, the descriptions of
his cities are masterfully written, and incredibly imaginative. Some of my
highlights follow.</p>

<p>A familiar feeling when traveling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant
  that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in
  time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he
  had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the
  place of that man in that square.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another familiar feeling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to
  resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless
  dust cloud invades the continents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So imaginative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night,
  by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out
  on piles of carpets, at each word that one man says—such as “wolf,” “sister,”
  “hidden treasure,” “battle,” “scabies,” “lovers”—the others tell, each one, his
  tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that
  in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camel’s swaying
  or the junk’s rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your
  wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle
  other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at
  every solstice and at every equinox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And vivid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus the city repeats its life, identical, shifting up and down on its empty
  chessboard. The inhabitants repeat the same scenes, with the acton changed; they
  repeat the same speeches with variously combined accents; they open alternate
  mouths in identical yawns. Alone, among all the cities of the empire, Eutropia
  remains always the same. Mercury, god of the fickle, to whom the city is sacred,
  worked this ambiguous miracle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>High modernist failure mode (after a generation, residents of the planned city
Perinthia gradually turn into by monsters):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must
  admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to
  describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is
  reflected exactly in the city of monsters.</p>
</blockquote>

      <div>
        <p>In the grand scheme of things, the western world today is pretty great. To what
do we owe its prosperity? I got curious about this and realized that the answer
probably lies in the broader traditions of the anglosphere. I'd heard of the
Magna Carta, and even seen it, but what was the big deal? Anyway, in my quest to
understand, I came across this great series of lectures covering English history
from around the 9th to the 15th century. Paxton does a great job of bringing
life to what I've felt to be an often dry and confusing time and place. The
narrative is mostly chronological, but once in a while, she pauses and explores
an area in depth to great effect. I enjoyed the many cross-references the
lecturer made throughout the lecture, her etymological diversions, and lively
depictions of heroes and villans, and also references to popular culture (movies
mostly).</p>

<h2>English chronology, roughly speaking 900 - 1500</h2>

<p>(Imagine reading these in the style of Drunk History, I think it works best)</p>

<p>In the 8th century, England was split into seven kingdoms, each with its own
local lords. These kingdoms were loosely organized into counties called Shires,
each overseen by a Sheriff. This structure was originally military in nature,
each shire producing some quota of soldiers to fight on behalf of the local
lord. During this period, England was plagued by Danish invaders. Eventually,
all but Wessex came under Danish control, until the ruler of Wessex, Alfred the
Great, pushed back against the Danes and reconquered all of England. This didn't
last long though, and eventually the Danish and previous residents of England
melded into one people. However this was a troubled time, full of chaos and
internal strife and a lack of central control over the country. (TV show to
watch: The Last Kingdom)</p>

<p><strong>William the Conqueror</strong> was a Norman (ie. descended from Norwegians who had
conquered and settled in the north of France). After a series of failed kings,
England's succession was unclear. William crossed the channel and burned farms,
cutting off the food supply to London, and sieging it. Eventually William
controlled both Normandy and England. He effectively suppressed rebellion and
got the nobles on his side. English society eventually subsumed Norman culture.</p>

<p>William's succession story is very colorful. Upon his gruesome death, his eldest
son took England, while his middle son took Normandy. The eldest went on the
first crusade, leaving England on lease to his brother. Meanwhile, Henry, the
youngest of the three, got nothing. After his middle brother died in a hunting
accident, Henry came to control both Normandy and England. Upon his return from
crusade, Henry imprisoned his oldest brother for the rest of his life (30
years?!). As king, <strong>Henry I</strong> made many changes, instituted the exchequer post
and appointed officials based on merit rather than birth.</p>

<p>Henry I's only son drowned in a drunken boat party. In his stead, Henry I
favored his daughter Matilda who was married off to the Holy Roman Emperor. But
queens weren't exactly a thing yet, so a succession dispute led to **King
Steven** coming to power. Steven was and not a very kingly man, and not a very
effective king. Anarchy and a civil war in erupted in England over Steven's
legitimacy, with Matilda's vying to get Henry, her son from her second
marriage onto the throne. </p>

<p>Eventually she succeeded, and <strong>Henry II</strong>'s reign was focused on mending the
damage done by the civil war, reuniting England and Normandy, and restoring it
to grandpa William's glory. Henry II married Eleanor of Acquitaine, further
expanding his empire into France. Sadly his reign was undone by a conflict with
Thomas Beckett, formerly his right hand man, but now the archbishop of
Canterbury. When he had Beckett killed for disobedience, he became deeply
unpopular and Becket was canonized as a saint. (Movie: Beckett)</p>

<p>Henry II was succeeded by his son Richard I, know as <strong>Richard the Lionheart</strong>.
He was extremely popular for his military prowess, as well as patronage of arts
and literature, especially the new genre of Legends of King Arthur, and Courtly
Love. He went on the third pilgrimage, by which point Saladin had already
reconquered Jerusalem. But Richard succeeded in defeating Saladin at Acco, which
remained European controlled for a century. </p>

<p>Upon Richard's death, he was succeeded by brother John. <strong>King John</strong> was not a
good king, cruel, and petulant. John managed to lose all of England's holdings
in France. He alienated his barons to such a degree that many of them banded
together to impose a great charter (Magna Carta) on John, designed to curtail
his power. This included trial by a jury of peers, and also no extraordinary
taxation without cause. John got Pope Innocent to repudiate the Magna Carta. and
eventually many English lords sided with the French, backing prince Louis as the
English king. John's son Henry succeeded him, and managed to best Louis and
win support of the English nobles with the help of William Marshall. </p>

<p>Under <strong>Henry III</strong>, the baronial conflicts continued. The Magna Carta was
reinstated, but still Henry III and his barons had many disagreements.
Especially on the foreign policy front, Henry III had many strange and foolish
ideas, attempting to reconquer Poitu in France, to place his brother on the
Sicilian throne, and to prevent lords from going on crusade. Every time the king
asked for a concession, the barons would trade it for more political power.
Eventually this led to the Treaty of Oxford, which extended the Magna Carta,
giving barons more power to appoint councils and administrators to effectively
run the country. Henry accepts the treaty but then reneged with the support of
an invited arbitrator St. Louis, King of France. The barons rebelled and forced
his hand. Simon de Montfort, leader of the baronial revolt also formalized the
structure of the parliament (from parle) which was formerly entirely informally
called by the king when he wanted to raise money. Now the parliament would meet
regularly, and be composed of 2 knights from each shire, and 2 members from
specific boroughs, elected locally. This structure clearly precedes that of The
House.</p>

<p><strong>Edward I</strong>, Henry III's son, succeeded him, to a collective baronial relief.
He was much more level headed than his father. Edward went on crusade, just like
the legendary and much loved Richard I. Edward passed many reforms to the common
law. In my books, he is ultimately a villan. He passed an Edict which banned
Jews from England, which lasted for the next 350 years, until Cromwell allowed
their return in the 17th century. In the grand scheme, this may be a greater
travesty than the Spanish Inquisition!</p>

<p><strong>Edward II</strong> succeeded his well loved father, and had an unpopular reign. He
was accused of homosexuality because of his closeness with his nearest advisor,
Galston. The barons hated this so much, they successfully expelled Galston to
France five times, and eventually murdered him. The barons attempted to rise up
against the king, but their efforts were quashed. The rebellion's leader was
murdered as retribution without a trial, which didn't help Ed's popularity. Also
Edward II suffered humiliating defeat at the hands of Robert the Bruce in
Scotland. Ultimately he was deposed by his barons and placed in prison, where he
died, possibly by being disemboweled as punishment for his lifestyle choices.
His wife allied herself with the Barons, and succeeded in getting their son Ed
III to the throne.</p>

<p><strong>Edward III</strong> started his career as king under the thumb of his mother and her
lover. When he grew old enough, Ed III took over in a coup and took the reigns.
For a while he was also a legitimate heir to the French throne through his
mother's line. Ultimately he conquered a bunch of French lands, including Calais
in the north which was strategically important because it was the opposing port
to Dover and constituted the shortest crossing of the channel. Rodin's famous
sculpture of the six nobleman of Calais depicts a an event that actually
happened where Edward III picked out six noblemen of Calais to be hung for their
subordination, but conceded when his pregnant wife begged for mercy. Generally a
very successful Ed III is remembered fondly in contrast to his father.</p>

<p>To finance the Hundred Years War against France, Edward III introduced a tax
that affected everyone, even the poorest. Previously taxes only applied to
people that owned goods, effectively a wealth tax. This new head tax also rose
over time. Also, papal patronage meant the pope instated high ranking clergy
from Rome, barring local clergy. This is also the period of the Avignon
"Babylonian captivity", when popes moved from Rome to southern France. During
this Great Schism, there were sometimes 3 popes. I'd never heard of John
Wycliffe and his followers (known as Lollards) but he was a sort of proto-Martin
Luther, advocating similar reforms to Christian orthodoxy such as a direct
relationship with God and redistribution of church-owned land. He even produced
the Bible translated into vernacular English. This economic and clerical
dissatisfaction led to the Peasant Revolt of 1381, which was the first popular
(as opposed to Baronial) rebellion. It was eventually quelled but did
demonstrate that the king increasingly had to listen to the people. The head tax
was abolished. </p>

<p><strong>Richard II</strong> was the grandson of Edward III. Richard's reign was completely
dominated by what is called the Merciless Parliament, which strove to further
curtail the power of the king. In retaliation Richard the second banished many
of its members and denied inheritance to several opposing Lords. Eventually he
was deposed by a new parliament and died in a prison cell in 1400. He was
succeeded by Henry Bolingbrook, who came to reign as <strong>Henry IV</strong>.  He was the first
Lancaster of a long dynasty, eventually leading to the Tudors. His reign was
short, succeeded by his son <strong>Henry V</strong>. </p>

<p>Henry V's reign was highlighted by successful conquest in France during the
Hundred Years War, most notably, in the battle of Agincourt. This was largely
due to internal divisions in France, but it made Henry V a popular king. His son
and successor <strong>Henry VI</strong> managed to lose all of the English territories in
France.  By then, France was united again, and Henry VI had little interest in
ruling was mentally unstable. The only English territory in France that remained
was Calais, and England held it for the next century. </p>

<p>Henry VI's death led to a succession dispute between two houses: Lancaster (red
rose) and York (white rose), called the War of the Roses. At first York had the
upper hand. Its leader Ed IV held the reigns until his death, and was succeeded
by his son Edward V, a 12-year-old boy at the time. But his reign did not last
long. Vying for power, Ed V's uncle Richard, invented a lie saying that Ed was a
bastard. This led to a successful propaganda campaign in which Richard III
successfully usurped the throne. But it backfired as most people could see
through the lie. Richard III likely executed his young rivals in the Tower of
London, and he was reviled by the people, often depicted as a hunchback and of
short statue in retrospect. </p>

<p><strong>Henry Tudor</strong> was part of the Lancaster faction, and had a claim to the
throne.  His first attempt to take over was thwarted by King Richard III, and he
escaped to Bretagne in France. From there, he eventually amassed an army and met
Richard III in battle. Due to his unpopularity, Richard's armies did not obey
him at a critical moment. Henry Tudor was victorious, the War of the roses was
Won by the Lancasters, and thus begins the Tudor lineage, a long period of
English stability. To cement his position and end the civil war definitively,
Henry VII married Elizabeth of York. He and his son Henry VIII then
systematically eliminated all of the pretenders to the throne, and paved the way
for English supremacy during the Renaissance. </p>

<h2>Crazy etymological stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>The name Easter comes from the pagan holiday Eostre. The apple does not fall
far from the tree. </li>
<li>To liquidate comes from melting of coins and other metallic valuables. Obvious
in retrospect, never thought of it.</li>
<li>Tolkien's Shire and modern police Sheriffs both trace back to medieval
England.</li>
<li>A farthing comes from the word "fourth", because it's value is 1/4 of a penny.</li>
<li>The title Earl comes from Ealdorman, rooted in "elder". Crazy!</li>
<li>Chivalry comes from the French word for horse, cheval. Another obvious in
retrospect case.</li>
<li>Heraldry is the study of coats of arms. The connection to newspapers named The
Herald is present but convoluted.</li>
<li>The notion of bearing arms used to mean that you had a coat of arms, as an
indication of status. This sure has morphed over time for sure!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interesting thoughts and insights</h2>

<p>It remains unclear to me what role Thanes played in 9th century England. Did
they have several shires in their control?</p>

<p>The Domesday book is an impressively early systematic attempt to survey all of
England. It was conducted by William the Conqueror in 1080s. Damn impressive for
the time. </p>

<p>Apparently the switch from oxen to horses for agriculture happened from the 11th
to 13th centuries, with a surge in commerce. Farmers were no longer subsisting,
but producing extra, which would be sold at markets and fairs. Oxen are stronger
than horses, but do not make very good riding animals. A second order effect of
this switch was a change in the shape of farming fields. Previously, plots were
long and narrow since oxen were very hard to turn. Now plots were much more
variable in shape.</p>

<p>Paxton has a really great discussion on chivalry. This horse culture apparently
was the delineating line between yeomen and elites. Tournaments began as multi
person melee brawls and eventually morphed into formal affairs that we think of
today, with jousting. This tracks the evolution of knights, which were
originally hired mercenaries but ultimately became an upper class, sharing the
table with earls and kings. This upward mobility of knights was greatly enabled
by the church, when it condoned violence in the name of the crusades. Finally,
the culture of heroism and going on crusades had much cache. Vividly, Paxton
retells the story of a blind king of Bohemia charging into battle flanked by his
two companions. He wanted glory in death and found it in Calais. </p>

<p>Written English temporarily died after the Norman conquest, and was supplanted
by French. This lasted for a while, as the civic elite favored French and the
religious elite favored Latin. Eventually written English made a big return with
prominent works written in it including the Canterbury Tales, which interesting
are about a group of pilgrims making their way to see the Tomb of Thomas
Beckett. (Interestingly, French remained the Lingua Franca of Europe for a
while, with Russia and other latecomers clearly falling under French influence
as late as the 19th century.)</p>

<p>I think roughly speaking, society was ordered like this: serf (indentured
servant), then yeoman (small landowner), then gentry (artisans, merchants), then
knight, lord, and king. Rankings among the clergy still elude me, but an
interesting topic for future reading.</p>

<p>I was struck that many historical "events" lasted much longer than I would have
guessed. The three crusades spanned 3 centuries. The Black Plague ebbed and
flowed also over 3 centuries. This is of course easy to see in retrospect, but
it made me wonder what sorts of 3-century long historical events people of 2500
will remember about us?</p>

    <title>Real Estate and Cash Flow</title>

        <p>"What Every Real Estate Investor Needs to Know About Cash Flow... And 36 Other
Key Financial Measures, Updated Edition"... What a title!</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm kind of embarrassed to post this here, especially so soon
after The New Father. But, I'll admit, I'm a bit spooked by the markets lately.
While indexing has worked well so far, it feels risky, and I'd probably be wise
to diversify. Hence this book.</p>

<p>The book makes two things crystal clear: </p>

<ol>
<li>"Investors don’t decide to buy properties; they decide to buy the income
streams of the properties."</li>
<li>The importance of discount rate in doing these various calculations, or as
the author usually descibes it, "the time value of money". A meta thought
about discount rate. It seems to be a proxy for selfishness. In the
self-interested case (maximize profit through real estate), you really want a
high discount rate, but in the long view, say thinking about climate change,
you think of future generations, and have a pretty low discount rate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, I liked the up-front breakdown of all of the ways in which being a
landlord may be profitable:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cash flow: "You expect to collect money, mainly in the form of rent."</li>
<li>Amortization: "You expect to spend money to pay for the operating expenses
and the loans against the property."</li>
<li>Tax shelter: "When you’re done for the year, you hope to have a surplus and
to keep as much of it as you can in your own pocket and out of the hands of
the tax collector."</li>
<li>Appreciation: "Perhaps someday you can also sell the property at a handsome
profit."</li>
</ol>

<p>If I end up attempting to purchase a real estate investment, the book will serve
as a good reference for calculating various terms of the industry (eg. APOD, Cap
rate, CFAT, etc). Honestly, this is really boring stuff, and pretty
straightforward from a calculation perspective. During the case studies
especially, the author meticulously grinds through the numbers, and I could feel
my eyes glazing over.</p>

<p>Oh, before I end this topic, here is an anti-recommendation to a similarly
titled, but much dumber "Rental Property Investing: how to invest in profitable
properties to rent and derive maximum profit from them". Complete drivel. Skip
it.</p>

sometimes helpful in calming the nerves. I'd recommend it to a new father.</p>

    <title>Tribe by Sebastian Junger</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/tribe-by-sebastian-junger"/>
    
    <updated>2019-01-18T09:00:00-00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Junger disparages modern western life, and has a very fond attitude towards
traditional hunter-gatherer civilization.</p>

<p>"How do you become an adult in a society that doesn’t ask for sacrifice?" he
asks. "Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel
necessary," he asserts. Modernity provides affluence and safety, but it's
incompatible with freedom and equality. It's easy to spend a day in a modern
society while "surrounded by others and yet feel deeply, dangerously alone."
"As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide
tend to go up rather than down," Junger says. Modernity is fucked, Junger says,
without citing Rousseau. It just ain't natural. Without hardship, you don't
really <strong>need</strong> friends.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Tribal society, while not perfect, was, and let's be honest,
pretty fucking awesome! So awesome, in fact, that "a surprising number of
Americans—mostly men—wound up joining Indian society rather than staying in
their own." I found this surprising, and sadly, there was no citation. You don't
really need to be a hunter gatherer, though. You can just be from Soviet Russia
(this resonated): "Adversity often leads people to depend more on one another,
and that closeness can produce a kind of nostalgia for the hard times that even
civilians are susceptible to." Junger makes the distinction between family and
tribe explicitly: "Even if he or she is part of a family, that is not the same
as belonging to a group that shares resources and experiences almost everything
collectively." I thought of the compania.</p>

<p>But even in shitty modernity, if the circumstances are dire enough, people can
still come together and act tribally:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Male Youth: "They drive too fast, get into fights, haze each other, play
sports, join fraternities, drink too much, and gamble with their lives in a
million idiotic ways."</p></li>
<li><p>War: "Emile Durkheim found that when European countries went to war, suicide
rates dropped."</p></li>
<li><p>Disaster: "social bonds were reinforced during disasters, and that people
overwhelmingly devoted their energies toward the good of the community rather
than just themselves."</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the US, soldiers risk a 20 percent chance of PTSD. "they return from wars
that are safer than those their fathers and grandfathers fought, and yet far
greater numbers of them wind up alienated and depressed. This is true even for
people who didn’t experience combat." Remarkably, in Israel, "Despite decades
of intermittent war, the Israel Defense Forces have by some measures a PTSD rate
as low as 1 percent."</p>

<p>Junger thinks that re-entry into American is so difficult because the military
is so close-knit, while modern life is so individualistic. "Soldiers experience
this tribal way of thinking at war, but when they come home they realize that
the tribe they were actually fighting for wasn’t their country, it was their
unit." Compounding the problem is the public's "thank you for your service,"
which rings hollow and reflects a distance from the war itself. Indeed, it's
an ocean away. Further, ever since Vietnam, much of the public has had a
principled disagreement with America's wars.</p>

<p>Junger wants to bring veterans and civilians closer together, to ease
re-integration. "More dignified might be to offer veterans all over the country
the use of their town hall every Veterans Day to speak freely about their
experience at war." Interesting start.</p>

<p>This struck a chord:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but
  frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral
  extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing,
  infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are
  mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nodding, I wondered: how disconnected am I? Why don't we go build a <a href="https://www.opensourceecology.org/">house or a
tractor</a>, or maybe learn the answers to some
of <a href="https://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/">these questions?</a></p>

    <title>12 Rules for Life</title>

        <p>One of my rules for life is: listicles are always clickbait, even in book form.
There is a balance to be found between order and chaos. These rules are
Petersons take on where that balance should be. I come at this with a dislike
for Peterson. I first heard him on a Sam Harris podcast and he came off as a
deliberate obscutantist. Also, the pronouns debate seems like a foolish hill to
die on. But when I. told me that he respected Peterson's ideas, I decided to
give the book ago. Spoiler alert: I got through about a third.</p>

<p>Tidbits I found interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classical music is a good illustration of fat head distributions / Matthew's
law / Price's law / Zipf's law. There are not many prominent composers and few
of their pieces are performed on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The Yin-yang symbol is actually about chaos and order, masculinity and
femininity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of Peterson's book is super annoying. Why the emphasis on the dominance
hierarchy? Sure it exists but is it the most fundamental thing about human
existence? After they're also other aspects to life that may be more important?
Peterson's is a classic zero sum framing of life, explicitly so in some places.
Petersons take on the snake as a primordial enemy that coevolved with humans is
a classic just so story. He ties it into Mary and Christ too, for good measure.
It's not credible, but his ability to spin a story is impressive. </p>

<p>Peterson seems to be writing for an audience of very low self-esteem men. This
is a recipe book for escaping this rut, at worst by becoming a narcissistic
psychopath. By rule four, I'd had my fill and decided to cut my losses.</p>

        <p>Neil Postman has strong opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 18th century was awesome. </li>
<li>Postmodernism is always, unequivocally bad. </li>
<li>You don't need typewriters or computers, paper and pen is good enough. </li>
<li>People are getting stupider and stupider. </li>
<li>Defeating straw man arguments is super fun. </li>
</ul>

<p>Postman cites many great thinkers in a way that is clearly erudite. However the
book is rather short and covers a lot of ground, making his name dropping quite
annoying. Rather than delivering deep points, Postman remains on the surface,
hinting at the existence of various philosophical ideas that he is intimately
familiar with. All this while struggling to structure a coherent narrative. </p>

<p>I found the book mostly useless. It's a shallow summary of some stuff I already
knew, and set forth an exaggerated technological pessimism that I, to some
extent, share. In my most charitable view, Postman's over exaggerated positions
were intended to provoke thought for some hypothetical starry eyed silicon
valley entrepreneurial techno-optimist. Unfortunately, Postman's position is so
extreme and arguments so cliched, I found myself rooting for the other side. </p>

        <p>I've only just touched the tip of the Chinese Sci-Fi iceberg by reading <a href="/books/three-body-problem-by-liu-cixin-audio/">Three
Body Problem</a>. So I picked up Infinite Planets, also translated by the same guy, Ken Liu.</p>

<p>Many of the stories were just too out there for me to fully enjoy. I'm not sure
if this is what's meant by "wuxia", but some had a sort of Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon feeling to them: extremely ephemeral, very unpredictable, hard to
understand. I really enjoyed many of the stories, though. Here are my favorites:</p>

<p><strong>The Fish of Lijiang</strong>: an endearing vignette of fast paced life placed on
pause. Opposites attract in a science fiction cliche kind of way. </p>

<p><strong>A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight</strong>: where does reality end and really good
simulation begin?  Emotionally driven, powerful storytelling. Interesting blend
of Chinese folklore with speculative far future robotics/AI. </p>

<p><strong>Night Journey of the Dragon Horse</strong>: Memorable sketch of a post apocalypse in
which a sentient robotic dragon horse awakens from a long slumber. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Time flows like a river, halting for no one. There is nothing in the world
  that can outlast time itself." </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Folding Beijing</strong>: Great concept, compelling story. Interesting take on
automation. Also, this served as my introduction to the cynical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve">Philips
Curve</a>. If I was to be picky, the
story felt a bit too directly critical of class divisions in modern China for my
taste.</p>

<p><strong>Taking Care of God</strong>: a parable for aging, intergenerational
misunderstandings, but on a civilizational level. Memorable and bittersweet.
Loved the special relativity explanation for the religious vs. scientific
understanding of Earth's age. Has this been done before?</p>

    <title>Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/bowling-alone-by-robert-putnam"/>
    
    <updated>2018-11-29T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/bowling-alone-by-robert-putnam</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This one's a doozie. I don't recommend it unless you are a naturally optimistic
and mentally stable person. I read Bowling Alone as part of my quest to understand
social capital. I'd heard of it before, but it came to my immediate attention
because it was referenced in <a href="/books/war-and-peace-and-war-by-peter-turchin/">War and Peace and War</a>.</p>

<p>Putnam's thesis is that by many measures, social capital in America increased
after World War II to its zenith in about 1960, and has been falling ever since.
(The book was written in 1999, but my suspicion is that downward slide has
continued into the oughts. It would be interesting to see an update.) Putnam
looks at a variety of indicators from a variety of surveys, mostly the General
Social Survey (GSS) and the DDB Needham Life Style archive. </p>

<p>Bowling Alone is long, dry, and somewhat repetitive. It's broken up into several
sections: 1) what's going on, 2) why is it happening, 3) why is it a bad thing,
and 4) as Lenin says, "what is to be done?". I skipped large chunks of (3) since
I'm already convinced that social capital is important and correlates strongly
to a bunch of important things that I'd like to keep having, as well as <a href="/books/war-and-peace-and-war-by-peter-turchin/">the
fall of empires</a>.</p>

<p>A bunch of charts and graphs that Putnam cites are <a href="http://download.audible.com/product_related_docs/BK_SANS_007716.pdf">worth perusing and available
here</a>.</p>

<h2>Social capital has been falling since 1960</h2>

<p>The following indicators followed the general pattern: peak in 1960, followed by
decline through at least 1999:</p>

<ul>
<li>Percentage of voters (PV) who worked for attended a political meeting.</li>
<li>PV who attended a public meeting for school or town affairs.</li>
<li>PV who served as an organizer for a local club/organization in the past year.</li>
<li>Number of club meetings attended per year.</li>
<li>Average weekly church attendenance.</li>
<li>Percent of labor force that is unionized.</li>
<li>Membership in professional organizations.</li>
<li>Frequency of whole family dinners.</li>
<li>Frequency of card playing.</li>
<li>Total giving by living individuals as a percentage of national income.</li>
<li>Percent who say "most people can be trusted".</li>
</ul>

<p>As Putnam diagnoses the problem, some striking trends stuck with me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trend towards social engagement under an umbrella of a church, and
increasingly, an employer.</li>
<li>Trend towards "privatized religion": belief without a specific congregation.
Non-organized religion gives personal meaning but no social capital.</li>
<li>Passive consumption up, active participation down. In sports, there are fewer
players but more viewers. In music, fewer players, more listeners.</li>
<li>Membership in organizations increasingly is a cheap way to indicate political
preference without dedicating substantial time or money to the cause. It's
also not social: most don't engage in person or discuss it with friends. </li>
<li>Depressing generational shift in what constitutes a good life and what
community means to people. More people want more money, and fewer care about
having a job that contributes to society. Patriotism wanes, materialism waxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as some concepts that were new to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bonding vs. bridging social capital: Bonding social capital is within a group
or community whereas bridging social capital is between social groups, social
class, race, religion, etc. According to Putnam, bonding social capital is
good for “getting by” and bridging is crucial for “getting ahead”.</li>
<li>Generalized reciprocity: gift giving without the expectation of an
immediate return, but with the vague understanding that someone will someday
return the favor.</li>
<li>Thick vs. thin social trust: very related to the above. Thick trust means you
trust a specific person for past deeds you know of personally, while thin
trust is akin to generalized social reciprocity where everyone in a community
is trusted by virtue of being a member.</li>
<li>Mahers vs. schmoozers (from Yiddish): Mahers invest time in social
organization, schmoozers: those who spend time in informal conversation.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of the section, Putnam's carefully hedges any predictions about the
internet, after a discussion about how wrong predictions about the telephone's
effect on social fabric were. This also serves as a sobering reminder that
social capital was well on the downswing by the advent of the internet. Thus,
Facebook or other oft-maligned internet-related entities cannot be the sole
cause.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A society characterized by generalized reciprocity is more efficient than a
  distrustful society, for the same reason that money is more efficient than
  barter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Because of TV, urban sprawl, working women, etc</h2>

<p>Putnam is explicit that he thinks many mostly weak factors have led to the
trends he's observed. But he outlines a few that seem to be the strongest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Women that are forced to work for financial reasons. This population seems to
have had the biggest drop in social capital. In contrast, women that work
part time by choice seem to be pulling social capital up. (~10% of cause.)</li>
<li>Suburbs, more car dependence, more time in cars, more cars per household.
Instead of living near work, restaurants, and shops, each facet of life is in
a different suburb. At the time of writing, the average american spent 72
minutes a day in cars, 70% of trips done alone. </li>
<li>Much of America's increasing free time has been channeled into watching TV.
Average American watches 3 hours a day. TV watching correlates strongly with
civic disengagement, especially non news watching, and channel surfing. (~25%
of cause.)</li>
<li>World War II was unique. The fact that it followed the great depression meant
that it had a leveling effect on most of society. In contrast, Korea and
Vietnam were both highlighted by social inequality in troop selection and
recruitment.</li>
<li>Controversial discussion about race as a cause of disengagement. Black % of
population has increased, but blacks actually are involved in more
organizations than whites, due to religious and race-based groups. But they
tend to be less trusting than whites (for good reason.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Putnam destroys the deterministic capitalism argument posed by Marxists, that
capitalism inherently is incompatible with social cohesion. Capitalism has been
a feature of American society for centuries while social capital has ebbed and
flowed. That said, increased globalization means there are fewer small
corporations with strong local ties.</p>

<p>Putnam makes many references to Alexis to Tocqueville, referring to him
colloquially as the patron saint of social capital. I was surprised to learn
that relative social capital levels throughout the states haven’t really changed
much since Tocqueville's travels in America in the 1830s. Generally speaking,
the more virulent slavery was, the lower the social capital. Areas high in
Scandinavian immigration, correlated strongly with high social capital. These
trends remain today.</p>

<h2>What to do? Look to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era</h2>

<p>Putnam draws analogies from today to the Gilded Age (1870s to about 1900). One
parallel is the way in which a surge of new technology disrupts social capital.
The advent of electricity, new mass media: the radio, a train network which
allowed much faster access to cities. The latter was especially important since
automation of strength was wreaking havoc in traditional rural life. More and
more jobs were to be found in urban factories. A centralization of companies
were named after their illustrious founders. And this all led to an increasing
gap in inequality. The analogies to today are clear: ubiquitous affordable air
travel, automation of menial intelligence threatening some jobs, the advent of
the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then as now, waves of immigration threaten the unum in our pluribus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Progressive Era (1890s to the 1920s) that followed, huge amount of
reforms were undertaken. The Progressive Movement was a big tent, considered the
only movement in the US that captured the whole population. It came as a
response to a huge amount of technological change during the Gilded Age.
Confusingly, there is no direct connection between the current Progressive
movement and its origins in the late 20th century. Here are some developments
that came around then: birth of unions, eight hour work week, birth of child
oriented groups, boy scouts, kindergardens, playgrounds, high schools.</p>

<p>(Clearly I should read more about the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era.)</p>

<p>(I should also look into Amitai Etzioni's work on communitarianism. Sounds like
he has some practical suggestions.)</p>

<p>(Bowling alone seeds an update. It would be nice to see the figures updated for
the last 25 years. A lot had changed: decline in real income, millennial
maturation, Gen Z emergence.)</p>

        <p>I picked up Shape of Tomorrow, its 35 cent price imbued proudly on the front
cover, on a foray to Powell’s books in Portland.</p>

<p>In 1958, the birth control pill wasn’t yet past clinical trials and TV watching
hadn’t yet become the dominant American hobby. What a time to be alive!</p>

<p>Soule takes care not to speculate too wildly, hedging often, but many
predictions are still downright comical. America’s increase in productivity is
going to reduce inequality. The work week is on the brink of shortening to
twenty four hours. Cool stories abound.</p>

<p>This was not a great read by any stretch. However, it is mercifully short. 
Safely skip the first half of the book, which excitedly enumerates unexciting
innovations of the day. That said, if you’re looking for a time capsule into the
technocratic mind of the 1950s, George Soule might just be the retro-futurist
you are looking for.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I've forgotten how this book appeared on my radar, but I think it was on
someone's list of most influential books ever. I am more ambivalent.</p>

<p>The book's subtitle is "Some Instructions on Writing and Life", and honestly I
was hoping for more of the latter. Unfortunately it was more of the former,
specifically how to write fiction, which is interesting in theory, but is not
something that is very high on my current list of things I would like to spend
my time doing.</p>

<p>In general, the author has some good tips for the fledgeling writer. These are
pretty intuitive, but do serve as good reminders:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with "shitty first drafts", revise later.</li>
<li>Write in small chunks as inspiration comes, as if looking through a tiny
picture frame.</li>
<li>Be wasteful with paper: don't worry about throwing out large chunks of what
you write.</li>
<li>Carry a notebook or index cards everywhere you go for when inspiration
strikes!</li>
</ul>

<p>More strategic and insightful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Observe the world and people for who they really are. Cultivate a sense of
"compassionate detachment" towards your characters.</li>
<li>Treat characters as if they have a mind of their own: “you probably won’t know
your characters until weeks or months after you’ve started working with them.
[...] Stay open to them. [...] Listen.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The book evoked a range of reactions in me. In the spirit of an open faced
compliment sandwich, I will start with the bad. A lot of Lamott's tips are
overly prescriptive, like that there is no need for hopeless novels, and no room
for an unreliable or unlikable narrator. I wonder how she and Dostoyevsky would
get along...</p>

<p>The author's tone is very California trustifarian. Attempts at black humor
are therefore diluted into a somewhat weaker grey humor. I think it makes the
book more accessible to a wider audience, but cheapened it in my eyes. In a
related vein, Lamott's progressive leftiness really shines through. There's this
hand wringing about western society being so broken and terrible. In a sense,
this is reassuring. The "we're in the dark ages and the president is Stalin"
sentiment is not a 2016 phenomenon, but had already emerged in 1994 when the
book was written.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I must say that a good chunk of the book put a smile on my
face. That chapter on Calling Around was really vivid and funny and
heartwarming. And she does produce some great visual metaphors, like these:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save;
they just stand there shining.”</li>
<li>Sometimes it feels... "as if writing a novel is like trying to level Mount
McKinley with a dentist's drill."</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I liked her stoic tendency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"My deepest belief is that to live as if we're dying can set us free. Dying
  people teach you to pay attention and to forgive and to not sweat the small
  things."</p>
  
  <p>"I heard a tape once in which an actor talked about finding God in the modern
  world and how, left to our own decides, we seek instead all the worldly things
  -- possessions, money, looks, and power -- because we think they will bring us
  fulfillment. But this turns out to be a joke because they are just props, and
  when we check out of this life, we have to give them all back to the great
  propmaster in the sky. "They're just on loan," he said,"they're not ours."</p>

    <title>The Fall and Rise of China (audio)</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Inspired by the Three Body Problem's best part, that is, the beginning of the
book set in Cultural Revolution China, I realized that I know nothing about
Chinese history. Perhaps, I thought, something like this might help? It's about
24 hours worth of material, and I took detailed notes in an attempt to retain it
better. The lectures are excellent, and I highly recommend listening. One
complaint was that I felt like the lecture lost a bit of steam and became
increasingly speculative as we approached the present day, but perhaps this is
inherent in any attempt to subject the recent past to a historical treatment.</p>

<h2>Before Communism</h2>

<p>Before the mid 19th century, China was largely isolated from the west. Chinese
society was modelled on Confucian ideals. The highest officials were selected
based on their ability to memorize profound lines from great teachings of
Confucius and his disciples. The entrance exam was known as the 8 legged essay
and super arcane. China called itself the Middle Kingdom, and was surrounded by
weaker states that paid it tribute. China had no equals, and submitted to
nobody.</p>

<p>The Manchu dynasty began its decline in the early 19th century, as a result of
population explosion, bad harvests, an opioid epidemic, and a trade deficit with
the west. Its exports of porcelain started to pale compared to cheap European
textiles flooding its market. (This is in some ways, an interesting reversal
from today's situation.)</p>

<p>China tried to curtail opium imports, and this led to the two Opium Wars with
Britain, who refused to stop the trade. China was badly outgunned by the west,
and stood no chance militarily. The Manchu dynasty continued to decline and made
successions to Britain, giving it a "small island" (Hong Kong) as part of the
military tribute. It wasn’t until the late 19th century that China had decided
to institute a foreign affairs department. Before that they only had a minister
of barbarians, whose occupants had notoriously short lived careers, lasting no
more than a year before being removed and punished for ineptitude.</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, China tried to modernize itself by sending its best
and brightest to study abroad in the west. The emphasis was on acquiring
military technology alone, while keeping Chinese traditions alive. This proved
futile, the lecturer suggesting that technology is a symptom of deeper
structures of European civilization like their government, economy, humanism,
and legal systems. This tension between European tech and Chinese tradition was
never fully resolved, and many powerful Chinese elite were opposed to anything
from the west (Mathematics? Ha!) despite their clear instrumental benefit. This
is in stark contrast with Japan that seemed to be able to reconcile its
traditions with modern technology.</p>

<p>The boxer rebellion in 1899 was a reactionary move against a loss of tradition
in China and increasing European influence. They were sponsored by the
xenophobic <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Empress Cixi</a> who took power in a coup. The boxers targeted a
German controlled area in China threatened 4000 europeans stationed there. In
retaliation a joint force of Japanese Russians and Europeans quashed the boxers
and killed many thousands, and led to nasty anti Chinese sentiment from the
German kaiser. Reparations were also imposed by the western victors. And China
returned to a conservative status quo.</p>

<h2>Seeds of revolution (Sun Yat-sen)</h2>

<p><a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Sun Yat-sen</a> was the first to integrate the need for Chinese self
determination without western intervention and the overthrow of the Manchu
dynasty. He came up with a three pronged platform: nationalism, democracy and
people's livelihood (land to the tiller). Later this became official policy of
Republic of China (Taiwan) and still remain credo of Nationalist party in
Taiwan. His reputation skyrocketed after a failed Chinese assassination attempt
in Europe. Gained many followers in the Chinese diaspora in America, France and
the rest of Europe. He organized multiple revolutionary uprisings in south
China. This encouraged over 200 peasant uprisings against the Manchu.</p>

<p>By 1910, Sun Yat-sen's relative was inaugurated as prime minister of the republic
(Kuomintang/KMT aka Guómíndǎng/GMD). He shared power with Yuan Shikai, a
conservative monarchist who declared himself Emperor. Yuan decided to
assassinate the PM and bribed the rest of the GMD to quit. Sun Yat-sen was
exiled to Japan, where he married again (interestingly, without divorcing his
existing wife). Meanwhile Yuan Sha Kai attempted to return China to 
traditional, Confucian values. He extended presidential terms to 10 years and
allowed him to name successors.</p>

<p>By WW1, the European powers were distracted by the war in Europe and
Japan decided to take advantage of the situation. Japan demanded extremely
unfavorable terms (21 demands) of China and Yuan Shikai had no ability to oppose
it. These demands were leaked to the public and a patriotic backlash ensued.
This eventually lead to Multiple Chinese provinces declaring secession. The
leader himself died unexpectedly, suspected poisoning. This led to a power
vacuum and an age of warlords ruling different parts of China. (The Good Earth
is a famous book about this period.)</p>

<p>After WW1 ended, European powers sided with Japan as thanks for its involvement
in the war against Germany. As a reward, parts of China were doled out to Japan.
This led to student and intellectual protests and ultimately sparked a golden
age in Chinese literature: colloquial and far more accessible books led to
increased literacy and spread of ideas. This included the works of Marx Engel
and Lenin.</p>

<h2>Early Chinese Communism and Mao vs. Chiang</h2>

<p>Communist reading groups started to show up, which is how <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Mao Zedong</a>
arrived to the scene. The Soviet Cominterm wanted to influence China and found
Sun Yat-sen willing to embrace their ideology and abandon his western facing
position (wow). In return he received soviet training and a bunch of
radicalized followers. <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Chiang Kai-shek</a> emerged from one of these
training camps as Sun Yat-sen's lieutenant. Sun died from liver cancer but the
party survived, with the right wing taking power.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek successfully united multiple Chinese contingents from the
communist party under a right wing platform and successfully took care of the
warlord problem with the help of the Soviets. Soon a left wing faction emerged
to oppose CKS's autocratic tendencies. CKS made pacts with European and mafia
leaders and ultimately abandoned communism as a key tenet of their platform,
thus departeing from Sun Yat-sen's anti imperialism. Chiang's forces conquered
Shanghai with their allies but the Communist left was not happy. This also
alienated the Soviet cominterm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mao and other communist leftists that splintered from CKS took control
of rural parts of China. Left wing communist rebellions known as Autumn Harvest
Uprisings were quashed by CKS nationalists. Mao wrote an essay that promoted
communism not through workers revolution but through an agrarian revolution.
This was frowned upon by the Soviets who expected industry to lead. Mao
established rules for Chinese Red Army soldiers that made them blend in with
villagers and farmers. By late 1928 Mao's forces were being forced to retreat
further but his political platform was maturing.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, Japan reformed, implemented western policies and retracted it's 21
demands. Still it's military thrived and Japan remained a threat to China, with
significant resource interests in Manchuria. The longer they waited the more
time CKS had to consolidate power and resist more effectively, and by 1931 Japan
controlled all of Manchuria in the NE and placed the son of Cixi as ruler of
that region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the south west, Maoists were another threat for Chiang Kai-shek.
Not willing to fight on two fronts, he decided to tackle the communists first,
letting Japan continue its expansions. Eventually Maoists were cornered
and had to retreat, starting the [Long March][lm], a retreat over 5,000 mi,
ending up in Yenan. In 1936 CKS wanted to pursue the Maoists again but the
general assigned to the task was a communist sympathizer and refused to comply,
since he wanted revenge on Japan. CKS confronted him near Yenan but was
kidnapped and coerced into alying with the communists to form a united front
against Japan, just in time for WW2.</p>

<p>(Interestingly the Chinese Communist Party came into its own as a result of the
Japanese invasion in WW2. This is somewhat analogous to the Soviet Communist
come to power after WW1.)</p>

<p>(Also interesting is that Stalin was forced to stop helping the Chinese and
withdraw because of the non-aggression pact with Hitler, and thus Japan.)</p>

<p>CKS was still busy chasing communists when Japan attacked, starting WW2. First
Japanese forces took Shanghai at huge GMD losses. Next was the massacre of
Nanjing which came at a huge civilian cost. Japanese commands pursued a scorched
earth policy against the civilians. This led to a deep popular resentment
against Japan. As the Chinese continue to struggle, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor
and forced US neutrality to end. Still the nationalists suffered huge losses at
the hands of the Japanese, their attention also divided by internal strife
against Maoists. Ultimately the CCP gained territory and influence while CKS
flirted with the US.</p>

<p>After Japan's defeat in 1945, America had hoped for a united Chinese government
and so tried to get Mao and Chiang and now to form a coalition. Diplomacy failed
out and instead they clashed in Manchuria. Just as Chiang Kai-shek planned to
take over Yenan again for the third time, Mao Zedong's PLA was amassing guerilla
forces to confront the nationalists in Manchuria, who were busy pushing back the
defeated Japanese and salvaging scrap metal from their former bases. Gaining
victory against ill prepared former warlords in the nationalist army, the PLA
proceeded to take Manchuria and marched west to capture Beijing, cross the
Yanzhee with the help of local ferrymen, and on to Shanghai. By 1949, Mao had
won, and Chiang fled to Taiwan. (I need a map of maos advance here, but the
article on the <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Chinese Civil War</a> probably covers most of the material
in more detail.)</p>

<h2>Mao's China</h2>

<p>The Chinese Communists made it very clear that they would side with Soviets not
the west, having been burned over the last decade by western influence. Mao has
a great quote about how there is only the two options and no middle ground.
(I failed to find it.) Meanwhile the policy of the CCP was to forgive those that
admitted to their mistakes but brutally punish those who did not. What followed
was a purge of nationalist and other non-believers characteristic of most
revolutions. Intellectuals were forced to go through an official process of
Thought Reform which included written confession. This may have been revised
multiple times until deemed sufficiently ernest.</p>

<p>When Mao visited Stalin in Moscow, Stalin showed his disdain for Mao and lack of
faith in Mao's ability to succeed. Stalin took a week to meet with him in
person. He gave Mao some loans earmarked for Russian military equipment, but
relatively small amounts compared to what he gave Eastern European allies. In
addition, the loans had to be repaid with 1% yearly interest. Stalin set up
joint stock companies in North China giving Russia partial control in industry.</p>

<p>In 1950 Joseph Stalin's and Chairman Mao's friendship was tested. The Korea’s
were at war. Initially Stalin backed Chairman Kim's North Korea against South
Korea. But when Truman decided to back South Korea he withdrew, seeking to avoid
direct confrontation. Eventually Mao assembled a volunteer army and pushed the
American troops back into South Korea. This back-and-forth lasted three years
and a total of 1 million Chinese died.</p>

<p>Domestically since 1950 China was destined to follow the Soviets, Also adopting
five-year plans, and forcing its peasantry into collective farming.
Collectivization basically failed due to the free rider problem, across the
board in all Soviet bloc countries. China was no exception. Mao also acquired
all private enterprises making them state owned. These reforms were celebrated
by senior communists at the 8th CCP congress in 1959, but Mao wasn't satisfied.</p>

<p>By then, Mao had been consolidating power in the party. He was now a larger
than life hero. At the same time, Khruschev dismantled Stalin's cult of
personality, and opened the Soviets up to the Chinese. The Soviets helped China open
aircraft factories and even shared plans for a nuclear weapon. Initially
friendly with Khruschev, relations went south when Mao was unsatisfied with
Khruschev's "revisionist" tendencies, especially enraged when Khrustchev
suggested that it was possible to achieve socialism through parliamentary means,
directly contradicting Lenin.</p>

<h3>Let one thousand flowers bloom (jk)</h3>

<p>To try to address shortcomings in the Chinese communist system, Mao decided to
"let one thousand flowers bloom". What this meant was that intellectuals we are
now free to express themselves however they wanted. Mao quickly changed his mind when
increasingly hostile letters started to be published against the Communist
system in China and against them chairman himself. In response, he began
systematic purges for dissenting intellectuals. It remains unclear whether this
was deliberate provocation. As a result, Mao revised his initial invitation to
intellectuals: your art writing and work in general should serve the
proletariat. Mao wanted to distinguish good thinking "flowers" from bad thinking
sabotage he called "weeds".</p>

<h3>Great Leap Forward (jk)</h3>

<p>To accelerate the advent of communism in 1959 Mao instituted the "Great Leap
Forward", which included many different reforms, Most of which had no experts
overseeing them. By 1962 it was clear that most had failed spectacularly, and
with tragic consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>To out compete great Britain in steel production, peasants built backyard
furnaces to melt down their metal. "Металлолом". The resulting iron and was of
low-quality and so useless.</li>
<li>A war against nature was declared. Large water management projects were
attempted but many ultimately failed. [One dam][banqiao] that was constructed
in this period, collapsed during rainy season and 200,000 people died (!).</li>
<li>Misguided attempts to control pests were instituted. Millions of Sparrows were
killed by peasants. But this led to an overpopulation of mosquitoes and other
harmful bugs.</li>
<li>New policies forced farms to collectivize much quicker than initially planned
and into much larger collectives of 20000 each. The larger the collective the
less incentive for each individual to work. Production dropped but ideological
fervor skyrocketed. Mid-level managers reported record food growth and
increased quotas, as well as grain exports to the Soviets. 30 million farmers
died in the famine that ensued.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile Mao himself was oblivious to any problem. He was getting busy with
young peasant girls during his village visits. But his party took note of the
problems. One party member, Peng Dehuai, was purged for his direct disagreement
with Mao's Great Leap Forward. Two senior party members, [Liu Shaoqi][liu] and
[Deng Xiaoping][deng] took the reigns for a time and took to a more calculated
strategy, quietly undoing the Great Leap Forward. Needless to say Mao was not
happy and began labeling everyone opposing him "mini-Khruschevs" and
revisionists.</p>

<h3>Cultural Revolution</h3>

<p>(Find the subversive painting with three red flags and silhouettes of Mao and
Stalin in the background. Also more about the three family village writing
group.)</p>

<p>Mao now had to deal with more backlash against his policies during the Great
Leap Forward. He retreated to his villa in Guangzhou and set his propagandists
to work. Impressionable students prone to extreme thought were an easy target.
Mao's new sycophantic defense mister compiled a book of Mao quotes. Known as the
famous Little Red Book, it became the basis for a new socialist education
program. Leftist ideologues spurred on students calling themselves Red Guards,
wearing green military uniforms, armed with the Little Red Book to commit
violence against dissenting professors and fellow students in the name of
ideological purity and conformity with Mao’s thought. Liu and Deng issued
bureaucratic investigations into the worst offenders, but when Mao returned,
he allowed the students to rebel against those "in power" whenever they wanted
as long as they were aligned with his ideology. This cart Blanche also
prevented the army from intervening in any way, to such an extent that brazen
students raided PLA warehouses and pilfered weapons. Student groups competed
with one another for purity, with those descended from intellectuals trying to
prove that they too can be good ideologues despite their “low” birth. Now armed
with modern weapons, they clashed violently with other factions. Mao fanned the
flames by closing down schools and universities for months, meeting with heads
of Red Guard factions, and becoming an honorary member. This student led fervor
began expanding into the general population, and soon the workplace was
similarly violent, unproductive, dysfunctional.</p>

<p>(The far left's tendency to fight and demonize and generalize against those in
positions of power is unchanged.)</p>

<p><a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Jiang Qing</a> was Mao’s fourth wife and also known as Madame Mao. She was
formerly a B movie actress, but now had political ambitions of her own. One of
the terms of their marriage was that she could not hold political office.
Instead, she began a concerted effort to heavily censor all media behind the
scenes. Everything was banned by default. The only content available to the
Chinese people had to be in service of the leftist communist ideal. Only 8
operas were allowed to run, all new and revolutionary. Women were forbidden to
wear jewelry, a strict plain-military dress code was effectively forced on all.
Madame Mao herself resided in her villa, banned works hanging on her walls,
decorated in jewlery, enjoying luxuries from the west.</p>

<p>As violence of the Cultural Revolution escalated, even the Chairman himself could
not curtail it through his direct pleas. Finally, he lifted the army’s ban on
intervention and the PLA quickly and violently quashed the student rebels. To
solve the student problem, Mao invented the <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Countryside Movement</a> which
conveniently involved shipping 17 million students to learn the way of the
village as an antidote to bourgeoisie thought. Tho rusticated and "educated"
students became known as the Lost Generation since they never received a modern
education and were unable to move back to cities until much later.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union and US relations</h3>

<p>In 1969, tensions between China and the Soviet Union were peaking. China had
recently demonstrated her nuclear capabilities in a small scale test. Meanwhile,
Brezhnev had outlined a new, more aggressive Soviet foreign policy, the Brezhnev
doctrine, which stated that the when a socialist country becomes more
capitalistic, other socialist countries should intervene. This happened in
Czechoslovakia, which set a dangerous precedent for Soviet intervention in
China. In addition to the two countries were vying for leadership of the eastern
bloc. China was completely outclassed in this regard having had several orders
of magnitude less money to spend on the cause.</p>

<p>Nervous about China's access to nuclear weapons, the Soviets were amassing
troops along the Sino-Soviet border. Meanwhile Mao decided to take advantage of
the opportunity and began playing off the Soviets against the Americans. Nixon
and Kissinger were interested in having disunity among the Communist bloc, so
allying with China, the weaker of the two potential leaders made sense as a way
to counteract Soviet power and aggression. To kick off detente, the American
national ping-pong team visited China. Although they were crushed by the
Chinese, the players built up a friendly rapport. This was publicized on TV,
which led to a warming of relations. Ultimately the culmination of this phase
was Nixon’s own visit to China. This was not without tension on both sides. Some
hard-core leftists are opposed to Mao's sudden change of heart. In America many
were still loyal to Taiwan and Chiang Kai-shek as the only China that’s valid
and were opposed to warming relations with any communist country. Interestingly,
China only joined the UN and became a member of the security council in 1971.
Previously the only China in the UN was Taiwan.</p>

<p>US China relations got stuck for a while and actually were set back by Nixon’s
Watergate scandal. His successor President Ford was largely ineffectual in
general. It wasn’t until President Carter when in 1978 US China relations began
to normalize in earnest. Many reasons why this happened, one is was the return
of Deng Xiaoping, who was unequivocally a reformer and not bound by Mel’s shadow.
Another was the growing hostility between the US and Soviet and a change of
heart in there a balance of power between the two superpowers. It is now clear
that the US sided with China as the underdog in order to weaken the Soviet bloc.</p>

<h3>Mao's successor and the Gang of Four</h3>

<p>By 1970 Mao is getting old and frail, and the CCP needed a successor. He
originally designated <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Lee Biao</a>, a fervent leftist. But he was opposed to
thawing relations with the American imperialists and was removed in an airplane
"accident". Mao also had designs for Ding Xiaoping, by now a very experienced
and proven administrator. But Madame Mao and her "Shanghai Clique" was opposed
and undermined his rise because he was too pragmatic and not ideological enough,
and was well known for pulling back some of the reforms during the great leap
forward. Another candidate, the premier [Zhou Enlai][zhou] was credited with
thawing US-China relations and received great press around the world. This
triggered Mao's jealousy. Zhou was subjected to struggle sessions courtesy of
Madame Mao. He died in 1976 from a cancer that Mao refused to treat with western
medicine. Chinese citizens were prohibited from paying him regards by Madame
Mao, but thousands did anyway, some writing angry notes comparing her to the
Dowager Cixi. Madame Mao had the protesters removed with force, and then used
the opportunity to blame Ding Xiaoping for the protests. She made an appointment
to see her ailing husband, who signed off on a request to remove him from his
political and military posts.</p>

<p>Finally, Mao had a specific heir apparent selected in his will “with you in
power I rest easy”, an unknown CCP member [Hua Guofeng][hua]. Madame Mao
attempted to alter Mao's will to write herself in instead. Upon Mao's death, a
coalition of moderate CCP members discovered this and put Madame Mao and her
henchmen under arrest.  They were called the Gang of Four. Meanwhile Hua
Guoattempted to ride on Mao's coattails and milk Mao's high praise for
everything it could offer. Still, he quietly began undoing leftist trends and
modernizing the country: </p>

<ul>
<li>Admissions into college were no longer political but based on
standardized tests. </li>
<li>Once called revisionist by Mao, he introduced incentive-based wage systems to
reward performance.</li>
<li>He opened up to china's intellectuals. Called for spirited discussions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As various leftist policies were being undone, all prior ills were blamed on the
Gang of Four. This became the scapegoat for the Chinese people as they dealt
with the cognitive dissonance of such a quick shift in thinking.</p>

<p>Deng Xiaoping managed to get back to power patiently and strategically. It
helped that his predecessor was not charismatic, deferring too much to Mao. He
was ridiculed for his unquestioning attitude: "whatever Mao said we will say and
whatever Mao did we will do" became derisively known as the <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Two
Whatevers</a>. Deng slowly took over, eventually holding high ranks
across the party's bureaucracy, as well as the informal but influential position
of Paramount Leader.</p>

<h3>Deng's reforms</h3>

<p>Deng continued in the same vein as Hua, but his reforms were even more
progressive and western facing. Suddenly the Chinese people gained a lot more
economic freedom. Small businesses were allowed to thrive and compete with
government entities. Special economic zones were designated. Personal rewards
were granted to reward high performing employees, the result of which was an
increase in productivity across-the-board.</p>

<p>Some attempts were also made to reform the political system and institute some
western policies. This led to an increase in dissent and opposing voices.
Ultimately Deng decided to roll back many political changes he originally
proposed. (I found it interesting to learn about the Paramount Leader being so
open to clearly changing his mind, without much protestation from the public.)
In his own words, he "crossed the river by feeling the stones", trying new
ideas, and sticking to them only if they work.</p>

<p>Although he departed significantly from Mao's doctrine, Deng was very
careful to not fully blame Mao for all of the shortcomings of the previous
decades. </p>

<h3>The late 80s</h3>

<p>By the late 80s, the success of various policies began to yield diminishing
returns. Many of the formerly prosperous village dwellers suddenly found that
their salaries were declining and were forced to migrate back in the cities.
This was also a time of huge corruption within the party, and inequality
skyrocketed. This led to student unrest and ultimately the demonstration in
Tiananmen Square.</p>

<p>Many reformist ideas were floating around but no new ones really got
implemented. Deng Xiaoping was deterred from giving in to too many liberal
demands, citing the events of Poland as an example to avoid. Poland was inching
towards capitalism as a result of a weak government that was giving in to too
many popular demands. And so, Deng Xiaoping walked a fine line. He wanted his
reforms to stick but also wanted to ensure that there was order.  During Deng's
tenure as Paramount Leader, he appointed various high level positions who were
officially in charge, yet Deng retained higher level control throughout.  This
also enabled him to retain a balance of power between western oriented reformers
and Mao oriented conservatives.</p>

<p>It was a turbulent time for international communism. East Germany fell quickly
follower by the Soviet Union. By 1989 the conservative left was starting to
gather steam and attempted to turn back Deng's western facing reforms. At 84,
and fighting for his life, Deng embarked on a southern tour, visiting special
economic zones and offering congratulations to a booming economy as well as
warnings about a leftist threat that might undo it all. In a tense few weeks, as
his health was ailing and the bureaucrats were vying for power, the tour wasn't
even publicized by the state run media. Eventually Deng emerged victorious and
the politburo officially declared that the left posed a higher threat to
China than did the right. </p>

<p>Deng successfully divorced markets from capitalism, and encouraged economic
reform while slowing political reform, in a gamble where he bet that Chinese
people cared more about their material wealth than their political freedom. </p>

<p>Meanwhile during the "roaring 90s", GDP doubled, foreign investment increased
7x, coastal cities and stock market exchanges flourished. Meanwhile the farmers
and country dwellers suffered. Eventually the uncontrolled market blew up and
consumer goods increased in price 15x. As many as 100 million peasants moved to
cities. Corruption soared: party members and cadres were immune to prosecution,
as was the army which managed to get half its revenue from market investments. A
spiritual crisis loomed for the youth and an economic crisis for the elderly.
This was the origin of "Free Tibet" and the Falun Gong as well. <a href="/books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio//books/the-fall-and-rise-of-china-audio/#">Jiang
Zemin</a> was appointed to be the General Secretary and promptly made many
moderating changes, introducing economic regulations and also joining the WTO
which is widely lauded as a big reason for China's Economic Miracle. Deng
Xiaoping died in 1996, aged 92 from Parkinson's.</p>

<p>With the economic changes came an increase in Chinese nationalism. Things seem
to escalate with the US but the two countries were able to maintain good
relations. In terms of greater China, Hong Kong transitioned peacefully 
in 1997 as per the British contract dating back to the Opium wars. 
Taiwan is a different, more complicated story. Chiang Kai-shek's son took over
for him when he died, and continued center-right politics. More recently, a rift
has formed between ethnic Chinese who fled the communists from the mainland and
ethnic Taiwanese. An ethnic Taiwanese president succeeded the GMD and pushed for
independence but the US, fearing war with Chana succeeded in reigning in his
idealism. The issue remains unresolved.</p>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>

<p>Holy moly, this is quite a long summary. I sure hope that writing it helps
me remember better...  Anyways, where was I? Ah yes, during the last few
segments, the lecturer continues on to discuss some specific issues in modern
China: the Internet, the Beijing Olympics of 2008. He highlights a spotty human
rights record, as well as Chinese monetary support for a wide variety of odious
regimes including Zimbabwe and Syria.</p>

<p>Overall a great introduction to modern China. Check it out.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>At its core, this book addresses the question raised by Asimov (his protagonist
Hari Seldon, a scientist of Psychohistory from the Foundation Trilogy): Is a
science of history possible? Can we design a theory for the collapse of mighty
empires that would be no worse than, say, our understanding of why earthquakes
happen? Again, here's a nice succinct summary of the book from the author (tl;dr):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The very stability and internal peace that strong empires impose contain within it
  the seeds of chaos. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity; prosperity
  causes population increase. Demographic growth leads to overpopulation;
  overpopulation causes lower wages, higher land rents, and falling per-capita
  incomes for the commoners. At first, low wages and high rents bring unparalleled
  wealth to the upper classes, but as their numbers and appetites grow, they too
  begin to suffer from falling incomes. Declining standards of life breed
  discontent and strife. The elites turn to the state for employment and
  additional income, and drive up its expenditures at the same time that the tax
  revenues decline because of the impoverished state of the population. When the
  state’s finances collapse, it loses control of the army and police. Freed from
  all restraints, strife among the upper classes escalates into civil war, and the
  discontent among the lower classes explodes into popular rebellions. The
  collapse of order brings in its wake the four horsemen of apocalypse—famine,
  war, pestilence, and death. Population declines, and wages increase, while rents
  decrease. As incomes of commoners recover, the fortunes of the upper classes hit
  the bottom. Economic distress of the elites and lack of effective government
  feed the continuing internecine wars. But civil wars thin the ranks of the
  elites. Some die in factional fighting, others succumb to feuds with neighbors,
  and many just give up on trying to maintain their noble status and quietly slip
  into the ranks of commoners. Intra-elite competition subsides, allowing order to
  be restored. Stability and internal peace bring prosperity, and another secular
  cycle begins. “So peace brings warre and warre brings peace."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Cliodynamics: science of history</h2>

<p>Turchin coins a new term for the science of history called Cliodynamics. It may
be sciencey in spirit, but isn't really quantified, and appears to be quite far
from even the rigor of a social science. Nonetheless, it's super interesting!
Here are some patterns Turchin points to:</p>

<ul>
<li>New empires and nations are born at metaethnic frontiers, where us-versus-them
mentality is strongest. This is in line with the worldview in Huntingdon's Clash of
Civilizations.</li>
<li>Successful empires grow under two conditions: 1. when their citizens have a
high level of asabiya (aka Social Capital) and 2. when they are good at
incorporating new members and treating them as equals (makes me think of the
continuous expansion of "white people" in the US)</li>
<li>Empires falter when asabiya goes into decline (Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone
is all about how it's declining in the US).</li>
<li>Social Capital isn't about morality. For example, it's not the case that
social power must come from democracy. It can come from tribalism or
elsewhere. To be successful, even an oppressor group needs to be socially
cohesive.</li>
<li>Asabiya can also increase as a response to new invaders, for example "Prior to
the conquest of the sub-Saharan Africa by western powers in the 19th
century, Africans had no sense of shared identity. But shared experience
of first colonization, then decolonization, and now the tendency of the rest
of the world to lump them together."</li>
<li>Civil war tends to recur during the disintegrative phase with a period of 40
to 60 years. Turchin calls such dynamics the fathers-and-sons cycles. The
survivors of the civil war and their children had direct experience of
conflict, so are reluctant to allow the hostilities to escalate again, but the
grandchildren of the civil warriors did not experience its horrors first hand.</li>
<li>Turchin presents a much more nuanced view of a cyclical view of history than
<a href="/books/the-fourth-turning-by-howe-and-strauss/">The Fourth Turning</a>, "The fathers-and-sons cycles are nested within
secular cycles, which in turn are nested within asabiya cycles." Ultimately
this nesting leads to unpredictable timelines, and in general chaos theory
means that dynamics of real human societies cannot be accurately predicted far
in the future because of the nature of chaos, free will, and natural
disasters. "Hari Seldon was wrong."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Asabiya and inequality</h2>

<p>A big cause of the decline in asabiya is economic inequality, which tends to
increase under normal circumstances ("Matthew principle") and largely because of
population growth. Beyond just economics, "the degree of solidarity felt between
the commons and aristocracy, is one of the most important characteristics
explaining its success at empire building."</p>

<p>Wealth inequality tends to be reduced as population density decreases, either
through deaths or increase in territory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Death: "Black Death had a beneficial effect on the survivors. The drop of
population set in motion the Malthusian machinery, but now working in
reverse."</li>
<li>Increase in territory: happens naturally at the frontiers of an empire as it
is growing. this was true in Russia when it was conquering east into the
Siberian steppes, and in USA as the Americans expanded to the west. The
frontier provides rewards for risk taking, and more upward mobility.</li>
</ul>

<p>Confirming my suspicions from an <a href="/simulating-wealth-inequality/">explorable exploration</a> I made a while back:
"The only way to stop this process constantly breeding inequality is by either
abolishing private property altogether or by abolishing the right to inherit it.
A milder form of keeping inequality in check is a steeply progressive tax on
inheritance. In other words, some sort of redistributive scheme could be used."</p>

<p>At one point the author digresses into the economics of agrarian land
distribution, and describes a series of simulations he ran. I think doing
something like this as an explorable explanation would be super fun. Imagine a
visual treatment of a country split up by multiple families, and how that split
changes through the generations. Here are some variants to try:</p>

<ol>
<li>Equal distribution of land to heirs but unequal numbers of children per
family.</li>
<li>Primogeniture, where oldest son gets all land.</li>
<li>First son gets half of the inheritance, but the remainder is divided equally
among others.</li>
<li>Wealthier men tend to choose wealthier brides.</li>
<li>Some people are just more effective than others.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cooperation versus individualism</h2>

<p>Turchin details how cooperation was once understood to be the main basis of
human society, but this view fell out of favor in modernity. The rise of
economics and the popularity of “rational-choice theory” postulated that people
behave in entirely self-interested manner. This is supported by many leading
thinkers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hume (1711-76) wrote, “Political writers established it as a maxim, that, in
contriving any system of government ... every man ought to be supposed to be a
knave and to have no other end, in all his actions, than his private
interest.”</li>
<li>Mandeville (1670-1713) wrote in The Fable of the Bees: Private Vices, Publick
Benefits: “Thus every Part was full of Vice, yet the whole Mass a Paradise.”
This does sound familiar. Wasn’t it the motto of the exuberant 1980s and
1990s—“greed is good”?</li>
<li>Smith is best known is his “invisible hand” argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem: "When the group size becomes large enough, cooperation among
rational agents unravels as free-loading becomes rampant. The collective-action
problem strikes again." An interesting study shows that people across most
societies naturally fall into 3 categories when playing repeated games: 25%
fully selfish, 25% fully selfless, 50% tit for tat. some exceptions: Israelis
are more selfish (lowball offers), while Lamerla are incredibly selfless. There
is a continuum between individualism and cooperation, and we've probably over
corrected towards the former.</p>

<h2>Historical trends</h2>

<p>Turchin looks at a wide variety of examples to make his points, and I learned a
lot trying to keep track of various indigenous proto-nations. Many of his
insights span across a long period of time, unite many seemingly unrelated
civilizational conflicts:</p>

<ul>
<li>One ancient source of metaethnic strife is farmers vs. shepherd-nomads: "as
exemplified by the biblical parable about the conflict between Cain with his
fields and Abel with his flocks. (Because the early Hebrews were herders,
naturally the evil guy in the story was Cain.) In eastern Europe, from the
tenth century on, the cultural chasm was further deepened by the tendency of
the settled cultivators to adopt Christianity opposed by the inclination of
the nomads to Islam." This continued in America where the Europeans were
farmers and the indians were nomads.</li>
<li>A failure mode for Asabiya is social conservatism. In pre-unified Russia, each
prince tried to resist the Tatar-Mongol hordes on his own, and all lost in a
typical example of the tragedy of the commons. In south Italy, primacy of
family unit caused people to distrust their neighbour, preventing large scale
social collaboration and economic prosperity. </li>
<li>Religion/race is a huge unifying force and common in meta-ethnic conflict. For
example Christians vs. Pagans in the Russian conquest of Siberia, Christians
vs. Muslims during the Crusades, in Iberia and in the new world. This was also
true for early Romans, who were bound together by religion.</li>
<li>Recurring thought: perhaps we'll need aliens to bring all of humanity
together: "Thus, in the old Europe, although the Irish hated the English, and
the French fought against the Germans, in the New World all these people
cooperated with each other and fought together against the Indians".</li>
<li>Wealth and power physics analogy: "Distribution of landed wealth within the
society usually correlates very well with the distribution of political power,
because wealth and power are akin to potential and kinetic kinds of energy in
physics. Wealth, or rather income derived from it, is readily converted into
power by buying influence or hiring retainers. Vice versa, political power
brings with it the ability to acquire land, thus storing power for future
use."</li>
<li>Interesting that slavery has a negative impact on Asabiya in general. Putnam
points to a “striking correlation between low social capital at the end of the
twentieth century and slavery in the first half of the nineteenth century."</li>
<li>Asabiya applies also to corporations: "Asabiya is as important in large
multinational corporations today as it was in Virginia in 1700 or North Africa
in the fourteenth century.", and "Ironically enough, although externally
corporations brutally compete in the free market, their internal workings rely
not on market forces, but on group solidarity! This is one of the best-kept
secrets in the economic sciences. Just as you cannot construct a viable
society, so you cannot put together a viable company from knaves alone."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rome and Italy</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Roman notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limes">Limes</a> encompasses some combination of border,
wall, and road. I haven't thought about these concepts as being so
interconnected.</li>
<li>There was no ethnic link between the Byzantines and the Romans: "Just
designating themselves as “the Romans,” however, is not a sufficient reason to
equate this later people with the Romans. For example, there is a modern
country whose citizens still call themselves “the Romans”: Romania. In
general, an appropriation of an old and glorious ethnonym (“a name of a
nation”) is a common thing in history"</li>
<li>Interesting parallels between Livy's account of "rampant luxury and
conspicuous consumption of his own times, the first century B.C., with the
simpler, less-materialistic mores of their ancestors" and the way people
romanticize America today.</li>
<li>Early Rome was incredibly cohesive because of huge vertical integration, and
virtues that discouraged individualism: gravity, constancy, piety, faith:
"When 50,000 Romans, a staggering one fifth of Rome’s total manpower, perished
in the battle of Cannae, as mentioned previously, the senate lost almost one
third of its membership. This suggests that the senatorial aristocracy was
more likely to be killed in wars than the average citizen. Add this to the
peculiarly Roman practice of “devotion,” which was always performed by a
member of noble lineage, and it is easy to conclude that generally Roman
aristocrats led the commoners in battle, and were the first to die."</li>
<li>Unlike Athens and Sparta, Rome did a good job of integrating its subjects into
the empire. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Muslim world</h2>

<ul>
<li>Islam as an attractive religion for those that recently experienced chaos:
"This quality of Islam continues to aid its spread even today. Ten years after
experiencing the horror of civil war and genocide, many Rwandans are turning
to Islam. During the decade since 1995, the number of mosques in Rwanda
doubled to 500". All Muslims are unified in the umma, which let Muhammad unify
multiple tribes into a meta-tribe.</li>
<li>Through this lens of us vs. them, good explanation for Austria-Hungary's
failures: they weren't sufficiently united, and had a lot of internal
conflict. Part of what kept the empire alive for so long was the 3 century
long struggle against the Ottoman empire.</li>
<li>On middle east, pretty sad projections: "Two centuries passed from the First
Crusade, which arrived in the Holy Land in 1099, to the rise of Saladin’s
Ayyubid dynasty in 1174. The Crusaders were expelled from their last
stronghold of Acre in 1291." and then "occupation of Egypt by the British
troops in 1882. The establishment of Israel in 1948 merely elevated it to new
heights, and the second Iraq war increased the pressure to what might be an
unbearable pitch for the Arabs. It is possible that the world changed so much
from the days of Ibn Khaldun that his law of asabiya does not operate any
longer. But is it wise to bet on it?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Europe</h2>

<ul>
<li>Southern Italy has been a disaster for 1500 years: "Peninsular Italy,
including Sicily, remained an asabiya black hole from the collapse of the
Roman Empire to this very day." The north has done much better, but still no
large public italian corporations (Fiat is family owned.) Also, they have
never been an empire. Italy was the only European state that was defeated by
an African country (Ethiopia) in the nineteenth-century scramble for colonies.
More on this in Putnam's book Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in
Modern Italy.</li>
<li>Interesting recurring metaethnic frontier: Romans vs Barbarians in early 1st
millennium, and Frankish Christians vs. Norman/Viking pagans in early 2nd
millennium. Also recurring alliances a milennium later: "The first members of
the European Union were, and the most enthusiastic proponents of the European
Union are, France, Germany, the countries of Benelux, and Italy—almost
precisely the regions that were part of the Carolingian Empire."</li>
<li>Germany had huge asabiya until WW2, but the shock of defeat and anti-Nazi
propaganda discredited this identity. Is the same thing happening now in the
US, as a result of several failed wars? Vietnam, Afganistan, Iraq?</li>
<li>One common myth: that France’s troubles were brought by the persistent
conflict with the English, known as the Hundred Years’ War (1338-1453). First,
the dates 1338 and 1453 are completely arbitrary. almost every generation of
the French and the English fought against each other during their “Thousand
Year War” between 1066 and 1815.</li>
<li>Overproduction of elites comes from education. This happened at times of
crisis in the past: "At the University of Paris, it took eight years to earn a
Doctorate degree in the thirteenth century (five years to obtain a Bachelor
degree, then three more to achieve the Doctorate). In the fourteenth century,
it took 16 years to earn a Doctorate. The cost of education increased much
faster than inflation in sixteenth-century France. Enrollments in Oxford and
Cambridge peaked just before the Great Revolution, and then declined during
the eighteenth century."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Random learnings</h2>

<ul>
<li>Siberia is named after the khanate of Sibir.</li>
<li>The connection of паган (pagan) and pagans, which lost its original religious
meaning and now just means “bad” or “evil.”</li>
<li>in Arabic khalifa means “successor”.</li>
<li>Jacobins &amp; Jacobites are completely different and unrelated groups.</li>
<li>Fascinating origins of tribal names: "In fact, the very name Suebi basically
means “us” (“those belonging to our group”). Incidentally, the names of such
modern nations as the Swedes and the Swiss have precisely the same origin. The
name of the later Alamanni also expressed the same idea, but with a different
means. Alamanni means “the (true, real) people,” clearly a variation on the
“us” versus “them” theme.</li>
<li>In France, Normandy is named after the Norse, and Brittany is named after
Britain. Nice to make that connection, completely obvious in retrospect. Also
it's bizarre to be personally named after a 10th century peoples (eg. Norman,
Brittany or Frank).</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay. I think I've distilled most of what I found valuable in the book (a lot).
Let me complain just a bit. Firstly, there are way too many small ethnic groups
for me to keep track of. Secondly, what's up with the formatting in the Kindle
version? Lastly, I found that the book was not super well structured, jumping
around conceptually, chronologically, and spatially, and going over the same
ground multiple times. That all said, I'll be reading more Turchin in the
future.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Everyone’s reading it, so I finally got around to it too. I guess this is a
science fiction mystery book, and I enjoyed it overall. I was a bit disappointed
when the whole mystery was revealed though, maybe this is the nature of mystery
books?</p>

<p>The part about the Cultural Revolution in the beginning was super interesting
and well written, including great metaphors which were somehow preserved (or
maybe introduced) by the translator. I also liked the way in which the Communist
theme permeated throughout the book, especially in how the message broadcast
from Red Coast evolved from one loaded with propaganda and political fervor to a
much more neutral and nuanced one. Incidentally, I wonder how this book made it
past the Chinese censors.</p>

<p>Throughout the mysterious first part, I got a kick trying to figure out what was
going on, and was really captured by the story. But I was disappointed by the
big reveal. I found the hard sci-fi quantum and multi-dimensional explanation to
be a bunch of mumbo jumbo, maybe due lack of physics expertise? Also, the AI
protons sent by the Trisolarans just felt like a lazy explanation for the weird
phenomenon plaguing Wong and other scientists earlier in the book. That said,
blocking another civilization’s development is an interesting angle I haven’t
thought/read/heard about before.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the development of some of the characters, especially Ye Wenjie and
Big Shi. She was a compelling hero and a complex character. Her early life was
well written, and again the slow revelation of the mysterious aspects of her
backstory was compelling to me. I think it also helped that my audio book's
reader did a good job modulating voices and </p>

<p>I really liked that I had to check some of the references made in the book to
see if they were fictional or not. Turns out Silent Spring and Rachel Carson are
real, but Bill Mather’s “contact as symbol” theory corporation is made up. This
was a nice device to keep me on my feet, and blend fiction with reality.</p>

<p>There is a dark, unstated backdrop to the whole book. Ye wants to find a new
civilization to right the wrongs of humanity, but after contact, rather than
some profound shift in the worldview of our intelligent species, concerns just
go up to a meta level. Both Sapiens and Trisolarans are back to the same
inter-species competitive grind.</p>

<p>This book made me want to read Silent Spring, and get more informed about the
Chinese Communist Party and Chinese history in general. I found the end to be
both a humbling and hopeful. We may be bugs, but we are proud of it!</p>

    <title>Book of Why by Judea Pearl</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/book-of-why-by-judea-pearl"/>
    
    <updated>2018-09-15T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/book-of-why-by-judea-pearl</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X">Book of Why</a> came up as part of a reading group I'm involved in. I
recommend this book only reluctantly. In the end, Pearl convinced me that causal
inference is important and historically under-appreciated. Science progresses as
a step function, and I think that in the current step in AI (deep learning) we
are already starting to see the plateau.</p>

<p>My reluctance stems mainly from the way the material is presented. The book is a
strange combination of anecdotes, verbal descriptions that genuinely help build
intuition, some case studies, and a bunch of name dropping of students and
collaborators. Most of it appears to be written for a popular audience, but
sometimes the author jumps into mathematical formulas seemingly conjured from
mid-air with very little explanation. Other times he provides terse proofs that
read more like a math text book than anything else. Overall, the book is not
well structured and awkwardly straddles the line between popular science,
textbook, and paper. I was also annoyed by the aggrandizing use of "Causal
Revolution", which I think detracted from its credibility.</p>

<p>Some chapters were especially tough, in particular Chapter 9, nominally about
mediation, seemed to drag on pointlessly. I also found some parts challenging to
internalize, particularly the front- and back-door criterion: what they are for,
and what they allow you to do. Perhaps if I was actively studying statistics,
and had more time to delve deeper into the content, I would be more patient with
the author, and find more time to work out the details of the mathematics in my
spare time. I think an interactive explanation of a causal diagram, data set and
application of one of the de-confounding criterion would be super instructive.
Nonetheless, here are the Pearls I managed to uncover for myself:</p>

<p><strong>Ladder of causation</strong>: Early on, the author presents "three distinct levels of
cognitive ability: seeing, doing, and imagining.":</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ladder-causation.png" alt="Ladder of causation" /></p>

<p>The vast majority of today's machine learning resides on the first rung of the
ladder: observational data. Pearl believes that the core of human intelligence
resides on higher rungs: "Deep learning has given us machines with truly
impressive abilities but no intelligence." Later, he suggests this more
explicitly: "I conjecture, that human intuition is organized around causal, not
statistical, relations." This jives well with my intuition.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond RCTs</strong>: what made me most interested in this book is the idea that
causality can be established by means other than randomized control trials
(RCTs). Pearl suggests having more than just data, but also a causal model, in
the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), originally introduced by Sewall
Wright. Pearl really pushes on this, evangelizing the concept. "A sufficiently
strong and accurate causal model can allow us to use rung-one (observational)
data to answer rung-two (interventional) queries." In many cases, running an RCT
may be physically impossible (eg. can't make people become obese to study the
effect of obesity on heart disease), or unethical (eg. can't force random people
to smoke for 10 years).</p>

<p>However it’s unclear to me how one is to generate the causal model in the first
place, and how you to ascertain that the model is "string and accurate".
Pearl says so himself: "If she is confident that her causal model accounts for a
sufficient number of deconfounders and she has gathered data on them, then she
can estimate the effect of Fertilizer on Yield in an unbiased way." That's a
fair amount of hedging.</p>

<p><strong>Blending probability and logic</strong>: Although he never states it explicitly,
Pearl's causal graphs seem to bridge the gap between formal logic (eg. A implies
B) with probability. This is interesting, but I think Pearl is very much a
statistician, since he hardly ever mentions logic, only introducing concept of
necessary and sufficient towards the end of the book.</p>

<p><strong>Casual aversion in stats</strong>: Pearl spends a lot of time complaining about
the mantra "correlation does not imply causation" embodied by various
authoritarian statisticians like Karl Pearson, and R. A. Fisher. Instead of such
a strong statement, the author proposes "some correlations do imply causation,"
although he does dial it back and suggests that it may instead be called
"provisional causality".</p>

<p><strong>Causal diagrams</strong>: The path diagram concept introduced by Wright was met with
resistance by his contemporaries, who were drawn to the allure of just looking
at the data without any models, since the data is objective, and models are
subjective. This is where Bayesian Statistics comes in, which tells you how to
update Beliefs based on Evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Disease prevention</strong>: James Lind discovered that citrus fruits prevent scurvy.
John Snow (not that one) discovered that water contaminated with feces causes
cholera. These findings were based on observational data, before widespread use
of RCTs, yet causation was established.</p>

<p><strong>Judicious biblical references</strong>: I loved that Pearl often cited the Bible in
this book, most prominently the example of a controlled experiment from the Book
of Daniel, but also chapter heading quotes from the Book of Jonah: "At last the
sailors said to each other, Come and let us cast lots to find out who is to
blame for this ordeal.", and Maimonides: "All is pre-determined, yet permission
is always granted." (Really makes me want to read Nevi'im and Ketuvim one day.)</p>

<p><strong>Monty Hall problem</strong>:
In Chapter 6, the book meanders onto the topic of paradoxes, which is a bit of a
tangent, but I guess is intended to illustrate the limitations of "first-rung"
intuitions, and ways in which causal thinking can nullify these supposed
paradoxes.  Imagine a game show where contestants pick one of three
doors, one of which has a car behind it, and two of which have goats. When the
contestant opens one door, the host will pick one with a goat. The host will
then open another door for the contestant. Should the contestant switch doors?
The answer is yes.</p>

<p>Finally I understood it like this: by the rules of the game, the host (who knows
where the goats and cars are) must open a door to reveal a goat. By so doing,
he has revealed information about the door you picked. (This was made clear in
the Bayesian explanation, without any reference to causality.)</p>

<p><strong>Simpson's paradox</strong>: Imagine a drug that is supposed to reduce the risk of a
heart attack. Here's fictional data for such a scenario:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/simpsons-paradox.png" alt="Simpson's paradox data" /></p>

<p>From the data, this drug has a negative effect on men (30% without, 40% with
drug), a negative effect on women (5% without, 7.5% with), but overall better
(22% without, 18% with). This doesn't make sense: logically, either the drug
increases heart attacks for people, or the opposite. It's a question of
partitioning vs. aggregating the data.  Pearl's fictional example is resolved by
the fact that gender affects whether or not you take the drug in the first
place. Women had a preference for taking the drug, and men had the opposite
preference, so you would need to control for gender.</p>

<p>Here's a visual example I found approachable. Both illustrations show the same
data set, in one case aggregated and in another case partitioned by age.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/partition-vs-aggregation.png" alt="Partitioning vs. aggregating" /></p>

<p>In the graphical example above, the more you age, the more they exercise. If you
don't control for age it, it appears that the more you exercise, the higher your
cholesterol! To be clear, by partitioning the group by age, you control for age
and get to see the relationship which is muddied in aggregate.</p>

<h2>Causal diagrams tell you what to control for</h2>

<p>A whole chapter of the book is dedicated to the smoking and cancer debate of the
mid-20th century. Many statisticians were highly skeptical of the causal
argument. Some lurking third factor could be the cause, such as a gene that
causes people to both crave cigarettes and made them more likely to develop lung
cancer. In causal diagram form, the debate is between these two scenarios:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/smoking-gene.png" alt="and birth-weight" /></p>

<p><strong>Junctions</strong>: every causal diagram consists entirely of these three types of
junctions:</p>

<ol>
<li>A → B → C: Mediator junction. Example: Fire → Smoke → Alarm. Fire causes the
Smoke, and Smoke triggers the Alarm.</li>
<li>A ← B → C: Fork junction. Example: Shoe Size ←  Age of Child → Reading
Ability. Children with larger shoe sizes tend to read better, but it's not a
causal relationship.</li>
<li>A → B ← C : Collider junction. Example: Talent → Celebrity ← Beauty. Suppose
only one of talent and beauty is sufficient to be a celebrity. Then, if a
celebrity were a good actor, they would need to be less beautiful.
Conversely, if they were beautiful, they would need to be less talented.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Controlling for junctions</strong>: if you view a causal diagram as pipes conveying
information from a starting point to an ending point, each type of junction can
be blocked by controlling for a certain variable:</p>

<ol>
<li>In a mediator (A → B → C) or fork (A ← B → C) the pipe between A and C is
open, but controlling for B closes the pipe.</li>
<li>In a collider (A → B ← C), the pipe between A and C is closed, but
controlling for B opens the pipe.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Back-door adjustment</strong>: Shit I really don't get it. This book doesn't do a
great job of explaining the technical parts. I'll pause for now, and try
approaching the material with this course instead:

      <div>
        <p>Over the summer, I spent three weeks in Paris with my family. I'd visited a few
times in the past, but only for a few days at a time. Since we had so much time
and just one home base in St. Germain, I felt immersed in the city. Upon
returning home, I wanted to keep that connection alive, and delve deeper into
French history and culture.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/living-the-french-revolution-and-the-age-of-napoleon.html">The lecture</a> proceeds roughly chronologically, covering France between
1789 and 1814. It is informally split into two parts. The first thirty or so
lectures cover the French Revolution, including causes and ramifications, and
the remaining 18 focus on Napoleon. Overall, I found it super informative
and interesting, once you get used to the sometimes monotonous delivery style.
It's hard to summarize such a long and detailed account in this format, so I'll
try to just pick out the stuff that really stuck out to me.</p>

<h2>First half: The French Revolution</h2>

<p>In 1789, the people of France came together into a general assembly. I finally
learned the meaning of the three estates. The clergy were the first estate,
nobles the second, and lastly, the third estate referred to the commoners. (Much
later, and in a different country, the fourth estate came to refer to
journalists. The fifth estate is an even newer notion, referring to journalism
with non-mainstream viewpoints, sometimes on the internet. There are also
enumerated estates greater than five, but it seems the higher the estate number,
the more suspect the source.)</p>

<p><strong>Political spectrum</strong>: during the contentious reign of Louis XVI, monarchists
sat on the king's right, while the republicans sat on his left.</p>

<p>Major causes of the revolution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Home grown enlightenment ideas (Voltaire, Rousseau) became extremely popular
with the French people.</li>
<li>The French government was going bankrupt due to poor domestic management, and
large expenditures on foreign wars with England. Thank Ben Franklin for that!
He was quite the diplomat, and made a splash with the French people, who were
impressed by the combination of beaver hat and ability to wax
philosophically.</li>
<li>A series of bad harvests led to bread riots in the late 1780s.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the revolution had started in
earnest. Louis XVI was coerced into moving to Paris to be closer to the people,
but as revolutionary fervor escalated, many nobles escaped France. Publicly,
Louis XVI supported the revolution, but privately he thought that Paris was
under control of Jacobin extremists. The king himself eventually attempted to
escape, but it and attempts to frame it as a kidnapping failed embarassingly.
Anti-monarchist sentiments flared and eventually the king was guillotined.</p>

<p>The revolutionaries instituted a variety of interesting changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Catholic priests were coerced to take an oath to the republic of France,
against the will of the pope. About half declined, along the left-right
divide.</li>
<li>A new revolutionary calendar was introduced. Each month was composed of three
10 day weeks called decades. It started on September 22 to celebrate the
death of Louis XVI.</li>
<li>New, explicitly secular holidays were created to supplant the old ones. (This
reminded me of Rationalist Solstice.)</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes were pretty radical, and led to a counter revolution, spurred on
by a desire for religious freedom, rebellion against increased military
taxation, and hunger. Peasant uprisings in the west were especially prevalent on
religious grounds. The Republican army wore blue which is why French soccer team
wears blue as well, hence the French cheer "Allez les Bleus". Monarchists such
as the Vendee from the west wore white with king and church front and center.</p>

<p>The new government, a highly factional assembly of people, was led by the
Jacobins, with Robespierre at the helm. They needed to maintain control,
quashing opposition. Marat's writing was emblematic of the mood in 1793 just as
the reign of terror was starting. He advocated for violence as necessary to
establish the Republic. “The death of <em>_</em> had become a necessity” is a recurring
theme in this sad story. Robespierre seems to be a tragic hero.  Initially
opposed to the death penalty, he slipped towards the terror one step at a time,
first arguing in favor of the death of Louis XVI, next killing others that were
seen as opponents to the revolution. This is the sort of thing that happens when
means and ends get mixed up. </p>

<p>There was also a strong proselytizing, international aspect to the revolution,
foreshadowing the Comintern.  In the grand scheme, it was a war of people
against kings. This led to war with Austria, which was desired by all sides.
The revolutionaries wanted it to spread the revolution, but Louis XVI, still alive and nominally in control at the start of the war, wanted
it so that France could lose and be rescued by his relative by marriage, the
emperor of Austria.</p>

<p>I was surprised to learn that by time of the Terror, America-France relations
had crumbled. I didn't realize how pro-British some of the American federalist
were. For a few years America was allowing Privateers to raid French vessels.
As an aside, I realized that "privateer", "mercenary", and the more modern
"military contractor" are all basically interchangeable terms for guns for hire.</p>

<p>Here's a resolution to some confusing terminology. In France, "federation"
refers to multiple states that have equal political rights. In the US, the same
word has the opposite meaning: a strong central government; US "confederation" =
French "federation". </p>

<h2>Second half: Napoleon</h2>

<p>Napoleon came to power through a coup in 1799. By then the French people were
too tired to resist yet another upheval, exhausted by the infighting of the
revolution, terror, and frustrated by a newly instated Directorate system, whose
weak executive branch couldn't rule effectively. Upon seizing power, Napoleon
drafted an illiberal constitution that greatly increased executive power. This
was the fourth French constitution of the decade of the 1790s. </p>

<p>At his core, Napoleon was a pragmatist. In 1806, Napoleon turned down the
revolutionary calendar. He distanced itself from the revolutionary ideals in
favor of stability, French nationalism and catholicism. I loved this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is by making myself Catholic that I brought peace to Brittany and Vendée.
  It is by making myself Italian that I won minds in Italy. It is by making myself
  a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt. If I governed a nation of Jews, I
  should reestablish the Temple of Solomon."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1806, Napoleon crowned himself emperor after a popular vote. He then amended
the constitution allowing for hereditary rule. By becoming emperor he solved the
monarchist threat, but the Jacobin threat remained. He dealt with the Jacobins
by using them as scapegoats for any rebellious acts and then punishing them by
exile or death.</p>

<p>Napoleon's strategy seems to have been driven by several modus operandi:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nepotism: he placed his many brothers into positions of power, used his
siblings for strategic marriages with European royalty. </li>
<li>Military autonomy: he restructured the Grand Armee into separately managed
corps to be more autonomous.</li>
<li>Expansionary conscription: he used the newly conquered peoples to expand the
Grand Armee with fresh blood, and eventually reduced the draft age.</li>
<li>Foraging and looting: by relying more on eating off of conquered lands and
less on supply trains, Napoleon's armies could move faster and be larger than
his opposition.</li>
<li>Domestic improvement: due to general mistrust of the people, he instituted
great public works projects that would placate and benefit them.</li>
<li>Military glory: due to a deep-seated sense of illegitimacy, Napoleon craved
great military victories.</li>
<li>Propaganda: whatever the outcome of his military campaigns, Napoleon made sure
his image was propped up by cherry picking just the good parts.</li>
<li>British nemesis: the French navy was consistently crushed by the British. In
retaliation, and because of a general French hatred of the British, Napoleon
banned English imports throughout the French empire.</li>
</ul>

<p>Napoleon's conquests are many and varied. At its peak in 1812, the French Empire
spanned from Spain to Poland.</p>

<ul>
<li>Egypt: one of Napoleon's earliest campaigns was a PR success, but ultimately a
defeat at the hands of the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain. This expedition
led to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.</li>
<li>Italy: after self-crowning as emperor, he created the Kingdom of Italy and the
Italian flag, which was inspired by the tricolor of the French revolution.</li>
<li>Austria: by 1806, at Austerlitz, France defeated Austria and its allies
including the Russian empire. This was the formal end of the Holy Roman
Empire.</li>
<li>Britain: at the Battle of Trafalgar, the French navy was crushed by Admiral
Lord Nelson's forces (Rule, Britannia!), which cemented Napoleon's hatred for
Britain. During the battle, Nelson was shot and killed by a French musketeer.</li>
<li>Prussia: in 1807, French forces pushed into Prussia and defeated Friedrich
Wilhelm III in two parallel decisive battles led by different corps of the
Grand Armee.</li>
<li>Spain: Napoleon offered to resolve a succession dispute between the Spanish
king and his heir, but instead exiled the royal family and installed his
brother Joseph there. He was overly confident that the Spanish would be on
the French side, underestimated their conservatism and their ability to
resist. 200K Grand Armee soldiers were stationed there in order to try to keep
the peace. The term guerilla (little war) comes from this period. </li>
<li>Russia: by 1812 Napoleon needed another great victory to maintain his
legitimacy as emperor. Once improving Russian relations had soured since
Alexander I felt threatened by French proximity in Warsaw. Napoleon marched
east with 650K strong and conquered Vilnius and by the time he entered Belarus
he'd lost half due to disease, extreme heat and cold. The day after he took
Moscow it was burned down by retreating Russian forces. Napoleon was
eventually forced to retreat and returned home with one fifth the men.</li>
</ul>

<p>Weakened after the Russian campaign, Napoleon's forces were crushed decisively
by a joint force of Austrians, Russians, and Prussians. Louis XVIII, a cousin of
Louis XVI, returned from exile and was placed onto the throne by the victorious
coalition. This Louis introduced a new constitution, attempted turn back time,
reverting France to the divine right of kings. He forced a lot of the army
retire and was unpopular with the people.</p>

<p>Napoleon didn’t last long in his exile at Elba. He was given reign over the
island where he gathered a force of 1000 men and marched back to France. On his
way, the French forces sent to stop him joined his cause instead. He entered
Paris unopposed, framing himself as a product of the revolution in opposition to
the tyrannical Louis XVIII. Upon his return, Napoleon amended the constitution
he drafted with limits to executive power, making France more of a
constitutional Monarchy. Of course, his foreign opponents were unhappy with his
return and decided to stop him once and for all. Napoleon had to prove himself
once more with a decisive battle at Waterloo. </p>

<p>Defeated, Bonaparte was exiled to St. Helena where he spent his last 6 years.
Even after his death, Napoleon remained incredibly popular and became more and
more associated with the revolution. After Napoleon's final exile, Louis XVIII
returned to the throne and was followed by his successor Charles X, in a period
called the Bourbon Restoration. The royal lineage was overthrown by Napoleon's
nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, who was elected democratically, but like his
uncle, crowned himself Emperor.</p>

<p>Truth be told, my interest was initially piqued by events of the mid-19th
century: the surprising rise of Napoleon III in 1848, and the Paris Commune of
1871, which I knew nothing about until my most recent trip to Paris. This
lecture series was as close as TTC offered on this turbulent period. I'd have
loved to hear the lecturer continue on in French history. It will be nice to
return to the subject later.</p>

    <title>Tao of Philosophy by Alan Watts</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Every society operates on very deeply rooted assumptions that are worth
understanding. Watts thinks we can seek wisdom from Chinese and Indian culture
to better understand our own. </p>

<p>Watts is for a holistic view of self without boundaries. We humans have a clear
distinction between the natural (eg. our bodies) and artificial (eg. our houses).
But what about bees? Are bees natural and bee hives artificial? Clearly not.
Watts runs with the boundary-less way of thinking about self and extends it to
limits of our understanding. Watts points to a certain fundamental law of
symmetry. Every coin has heads and tails, every inside has an outside. Waves,
the fundamental unit of animal perception is composed from crests and troughs.
You cannot have one without the other. His ultimate aim here is to try to
eliminate the illusion of self. In this view, there’s no barrier between
yourself and the rest, just a unified whole. </p>

<p>Watts is a big fan of gerunds, and does a good job of taking an outside view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple tree “apples”, meaning it produces apples, and in the same way earth
  “peoples”, producing intelligent humans. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He breaks down various kinds of “why?” Which reminds me of Alex’s post that
in Russian there are at least two words for why: зачем (instrumental: what is it
for?) and почему (epistemic: how is it so?). Watts scoffs at the instrumental
and gravitates towards the epistemic question.</p>

<p>Relatedly, Watts preaches the need for purposelessness as an end in itself. If
you play because it is good for you, you aren’t really playing. Playing has to
be purposeless, like daydreaming or dancing for its own sake. Significance must
be in itself, not for the sake of something else. Great example of Bach and
baroque composers that are satisfying as is without having explicit meaning.
Watts calls for us to embrace nonsense, pointing at Lewis Carroll’s whimsical
“twas brillig...”, babbling choruses in English folk songs (eg. The Corries) and
bopping to Jazz. </p>

<p>He quotes G. K. Chesterton quite a bit, and I enjoyed the quotes he selected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is one thing to look with amazement at gorgon or griffin, a creature that
  does not exist, but it is quite another thing to look at a hippopotamus, a
  creature who does exist, but looks like he does not. – G. K. Chesterton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watts ends with a question: Is human nature flawed as in western
conception? Or is it fundamentally trustworthy and essentially good as in the
Chinese conception? The sentiment “I do not trust nature, it has to be watched”
quickly leads to totalitarianism since you assume the worst in people.</p>

        <p>A sad story about Theranos and it’s leadership, in large part Elisabeth Holmes,
a tragic hero with a fatal flaw: unbridled ambition. </p>

<p>The rest follows: unreasonably high confidence, sweeping major problems under
the rug, and cargo cult worship dedicated to successful leaders. Which includes
setting super high expectations for employees, fostering internal competition,
demanding absolute loyalty and punishing any whiffs of dissent. </p>

<p>What was most surprising to me were the many ethical breaches exhibited by
Holmes herself: mixing business and romance, hiring exclusively political
celebrities to your board, and showing almost no empathy for employees, while
pursuing ruthless legal tactics in personal vendettas. </p>

<p>It’s hard to say how fringe the Theranos story is. I’ve seen some parts in other
Silicon Valley contexts, especially Steve Jobs worship, unreasonable levels of
confidence in executives. And incredible secrecy for questionable reasons. </p>

<p>But some parts of the Theranos story seem more unique, especially given their
specialized domain of health care where I think many startups tread lightly
because of the regulatory environment. Uber may be a good analogy and
counterpoint here, playing hard and fast with regulation and actually
succeeding. The stakes in health care are understandably higher and its probably
a good thing Theranos was ultimately stopped. </p>

<p>The Theranos story may in part be a cautionary tale of digital culture colliding
with physical culture. But it is not helped by a morally compromised leader who
believes that the ends justify the means. </p>

    <title>Darkness at Noon by Arthur Koestler (audio)</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/darkness-at-noon-by-arthur-koestler-audio"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I learned about "Darkness at Noon" from a <a href="/books/reason-in-human-affairs-by-herbert-simon/">Herb Simon
essay</a>, where he praised
emotional story telling as a vehicle for helping people "attend to issues
longer, to think harder about them, to receive deeper impressions that last
longer". He asked: would you rather read "Darkness at Noon", or verbatim
transcripts of Stalin's purges?</p>

<p>The book is historical fiction loosely based on 1930s Soviet Russia. Supposed
counter revolutionary movements are being quashed by Stalin. The "hero",
Nicholas Rubashov finds himself in the middle of absurd Stalinist show trials,
having to publicly admit to crimes he never committed. The intent of his captor
is “to gild the right, to blacken the wrong”, ingraining black and white thinking
into the masses. The means and ends of the current government are good and just
and pure, and everything that opposes it is hellspawn and deserves only one
fate. Despite Rubashov's intention to deliver an impassioned speech
like Danton did before the guillotine, he finds himself powerless against the
Soviet machine, mechanically pleading guilty in the show trial, and then being
put to death.</p>

<p>That isn't to say that Rubashov is innocent. As a younger man fervently
dedicated to the party, he indirectly condemned his own lover to death,
supposedly for the sake of the collective. Now in jail, and softened by sudden
onsets of nuance, the former revolutionary has time to reflect. Intensely
psychological, the book delves into Rubashov's evolution as he realizes that
human life is sacred and no idea is worth sacrificing it for. Rational
mathematics does not apply in this domain, and Rubashov eventually becomes a
humanist. Fundamentally, Koestler's powerful critique of Stalinism is that the
ends do not justify the means.</p>

<p>Late in the book, a distinction between two kinds of suffering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Biological: Inevitable suffering from unmet basic needs.</li>
<li>Social: Avoidable suffering from broken social systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>Koestler observes that Revolution reduces Type 2 suffering but inevitably
increases to Tyle 1 suffering. Was the Russian Revolution justified? When is
revolution ever justified?  Through Rubashov, he wrestles with this issue,
acknowledging the need for social change, but questioning the means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One cannot heal a person mortally ill by pious exhortations. The only solution
  was the surgeon's knife and his cool calculation. But wherever the knife had
  been applied, a new sore had appeared in place of the old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really liked this book. Not having read the transcript of Stalin's purges, I
am going to assume that Herbert Simon was right: Darkness at Noon is well
written, interesting, and visceral.</p>

        <p>Buckminster Fuller's name seems to pop up everywhere in the last few years. I
saw Jonathon Keats talk at The Interval a few years ago, on a book tour about
Fuller's life and work. I finally got to listen to the audio version. I found
bits to be interesting, but overall this book is less of a biography, and more
of an attempt to riff on various modern incarnations of Fuller's ideas. Fuller
himself comes off as overly self-involved. His investment and belief in panacea
projects like the World Game, Domed Manhattan, Dymaxions comes off as overly
naive for such a great man.</p>

<p>The book itself is interesting but not groundbreaking. It involves overly
flowery descriptions of things that I consider obvious: Google, Nest, Sim City,
self driving cars, etc. The end appears especially weak. The author spends too
much time on platitudes about specialization. If I had a dollar for every time
he wrote “comprehensive anticipatory design science”...</p>

<p>Leads from the book:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wikihouse.cc/">Wikihouse</a>: simple, sustainable, open building
technologies.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/mooc-pre-history">Sunrise Semester</a> was an early morning CBS program that offered NYU courses for credit to viewers, precursor of MOOCs. Thousands of people participated.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/green-float/">Green Float</a> is a
proposed floating city concept developed by Shimizu Corporation of Japan.</li>
<li>Lewis Mumfort's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Machine">Pentagon of Power</a> criticizes planned cities as
anti-cities, and Bucky's <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/863">Tetrahedron City project</a> as “A pyramid big
enough to entomb the population of a while town”.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shigerubanarchitects.com/works/2013_CCC/index.html">Shigeru Ban</a> designed some cardboard-based buildings for refugees,
from practical dwellings to cathedrals. Impressive!</li>
<li>One of Fuller's collaborators, critiques domes as <a href="http://www.domerama.com/general/smart-but-not-wise/">"smart but not
wise"</a>, a quip that is often applicable to modern tech. Specifically:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metaphorically, our work on domes now appears to us to have been smart: mathematics, computers, new materials, plastics. Yet reevaluation of our actual building experiments, publications, and feedback from others leads us to emphasize that there continue to be many unsolved problems with dome homes. Difficulties in making the curved shapes livable, short lives of modern materials, and as-yet-unsolved detail and weatherproofing problems.</p>

    <title>Unsong by Scott Alexander</title>

    <link href="https://smus.com/books/unsong-by-scott-alexander"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Unsong is based on a really compelling concept. As it turns out, the Torah is
literally true. God is real, angels and demons literally control the fate of the
world. Kaballah is indeed the fundamental way that the universe works. Some
people continue to irrationally cling to their old beliefs (Science, Pluralism)
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Earth is the center of the
Universe, and when Apollo 11 launched, it crashed into the firmament and left a
gaping hole in it. </p>

<p>Alexander's novel excels at world building. The back story to how the world came
to be is fascinating. Unsong is full of gullible archangels and clever
Kaballists-programmers, San Francisco is Jerusalem, magical incantations possess
true powers and a righteous police force enforces their usage. These are all
super creative components of the complex universe conjured from thin air.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite the awesome concept, Unsong is not well executed. The
storyline is dull, the characters all speak in one voice, the pacing is off, the
interludes break the flow of the story, and the puns get annoying fast. This is
in stark contrast with Ted Chiang's works, which are great conceptually and
share some of the same fascinating themes (Tower of Babel, Hell is the absence
of God, the one about golems). The difference is that Chiang’s stories are well
crafted and come together as coherent wholes. They are emotionally driven,
memorable, well paced, and appropriate in length. </p>

<p>I got through half of the book over the last few months, in small chunks because
Eliana is so small, often having to put the book down out of annoyance. Today I
have decided to declare bankruptcy. I am not invested in the story, I don't care
about the characters, and I don't care what happens in the end. Perhaps one day,
if it is aggressively edited, I will give it another chance.</p>

    <title>Reason in Human Affairs by Herbert Simon</title>

        <p>One of the people I worked with at CMU was a "Herbert A. Simon Professor of
Human-Computer Interaction". I hadn't heard of Herbert Simon before, but his
name came up again recently at the end of <a href="/books/skin-in-the-game-by-taleb-audio/">"Skin in the Game"</a>. Turns out Simon
was a pretty interesting guy, and had a lot to say about Rationality.</p>

<p>Simon was an academic, and mostly wrote for academic audiences. This is his
least academic book, and still presents a dry read. The first essay, called
"Visions of Rationality", describes three flavors of rationality: SEU,
Bounded Rationality, and Intuitive Rationality. I skipped the second essay
because it was too boring. The third essay was about rationality in
organizations, which is Simon's home turf, being a key figure in Organizational
Behavior.</p>

<p>Critically, Simon treats reason as "wholly instrumental. It cannot tell us where
to go; at best it can tell us how to get there. Thus, whereas reason may provide
powerful help in finding means to reach our ends, it has little to say about the
ends themselves".</p>

<p>Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) is the God-like “Olympian model”, but is not a
suitable model for the mind of man. That said, Rationalists tend to elevate this
model:</p>

<ol>
<li>Well defined utility function.</li>
<li>Well defined set of alternatives to choose from.</li>
<li>Can assign a consistent joint probability distribution to all future sets of
events.</li>
<li>Maximize the expected value of the utility function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bounded rationality postulates that our minds are limited, bounded by
computational powers. The model more closely reflects human ability:</p>

<ol>
<li>A mechanism to focus attention. "Rationality could focus on dealing with one
or a few problems at a time".</li>
<li>A mechanism capable of generating alternatives.</li>
<li>A capability for acquiring facts about the environment, the ability to draw
inferences from facts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Intuitive rationality recognizes that thought is often affected by emotion, 
which can usefully "distract you from your current focus of thought, and to call
your attention to something else that presumably needs attention right now.".
There is no contradiction between SEU/Bounded models and intuitive rationality.</p>

<p>I really liked Herb Simon’s take on novels over textbooks for teaching social
science. This “hot cognition” is what makes Ted Chiang’s stuff so compelling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most humans are able to attend to issues longer, to think harder about them,
  to receive deeper impressions that last longer, if information is presented in a
  context of emotion, a sort of hot dressing, than if it’s presented wholly
  without effect.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Darkness at Noon" vs. a history book or transcripts of Stalin's purges?</li>
<li>"War and Peace" vs. a treatise on military sociology?</li>
<li>Proust and Chekhov versus a textbook on personality?</li>
</ul>

<p>People respond well to story, but this leaves us with an important
responsibility: “if we are to learn our social science from novelists, then the
novelists have to get it right. The scientific content must be valid.” Example:
Freud’s stuff still permeates novels despite very few orthodox Freudians left in
psych today.</p>

      <div>
        <p>I don’t remember why I decided to read this book. The political theory it
describes is loved by both Gore and Bannon. This surprisingly heterogeneous
recommendation reignited my interest when I saw it on my reading list. </p>

<p>The basic idea is this: history is cyclical with the unit of interest being
80-90 years. The authors call it a "saeculum", also known as a natural century,
or a long human life. Each saeculum has four stages with the last one climaxing
into a crisis. Each stage is associated with a general mood, and last roughly
20-22 years each. </p>

<ol>
<li>High - occurs after a crisis, institutions are strong, individuals weak. </li>
<li>Awakening - institutions are attacked in the name of personal autonomy. </li>
<li>Unraveling - institutions are weak, individuals strong. </li>
<li>Crisis - often involves destruction, sometimes war or revolution. </li>
</ol>

<p>Each stage brings forth a new generation with a distinct personality type which
evolves the generational lifespan.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prophets (eg. Boomers) enter childhood during a High, a time of rejuvenated
community life and consensus around a new societal order.</li>
<li>Nomads (eg. Gen X) enter childhood during an Awakening, a time of social
ideals and spiritual agendas, when young adults are passionately attacking
the established institutional order.</li>
<li>Heros (eg. Millenials, G. I. Generation) enter childhood during an
Unraveling, a time of individual pragmatism, self-reliance, and
laissez-faire.</li>
<li>Artists (eg. Gen Z, Silent Generation) enter childhood during a Crisis, a
time when great dangers cut down social and political complexity in favor of
public consensus, aggressive institutions, and an ethic of personal
sacrifice. </li>
</ol>

<p>The authors view <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory#Timing_of_generations_and_turnings">history through this lens</a>, for example citing
previous great crises in US history:</p>

<ul>
<li>1774-94: Era of the American Revolution and the Constitution</li>
<li>1860-68: the Civil War and its immediate aftermath </li>
<li>1929-45: and the Depression and the Second World War</li>
</ul>

<p>The book is written in 1997, and the authors make grand predictions for the next
decades, it's fun to see how well the theory predicts the present. It's still
too soon to know how accurate their predictions were, but it's already clear
that their track record will be a mixed bag.</p>

<p>The Crisis turning of this last saeculum was supposed to start sometime
2002-2008, peak around 2020, and resolve by 2026. Several important events can
be shoehorned into the theory as demarcating the beginning of the fourth
turning: 9/11 in 2001, the recession of 2008. Trump's election in 2016 can also
fit into their framework. Other things are way off. The way the media represents
millennials is quite far from heroic (at least so far). Or like the way that
millennial’s are supposed to be like GIs, community focused and socially
cohesive. The increased communitarianism in the 4th turning has not panned out. </p>

<p>A summary from Howe from 2017 retroactively glosses over the parts that don’t
fit, and focuses on those that do: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yfb2zQjKWE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yfb2zQjKWE</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the theory is unfalsifiable and overly general. Specific claims in the
book are often unsubstantiated. However I found it an entertaining read, and
potentially a fruitful “fake framework”. </p>

    <title>The Coffee-House: A Cultural History</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>A chronicle of coffee, especially focused on the coffee houses of 17th and 18th
century England. I found it too long-winded to recommend outright. So here's a
much shorter summary that captures the parts that I found most interesting.</p>

<p><strong>In Turkey</strong>, coffee was used by Sufis, "as a medicinal delicacy to enable the
pious and the studious to stay awake during their devotions". It was also used
more socially in many coffee houses throughout the Ottoman empire: "There sit
they chatting most of the day; and sippe of a drinke called Coffa (of the berry
that it is made of) in little China dishes, as hot as they can suffer it. It
came to symbolize freedom of assembly, so much so that "building a grand
coffee-house became one of the first things Ottoman rulers did in newly
conquered cities, to demonstrate the civility of their rule." Smyrma had over 40
coffee houses in 1658. In addition, it was very egalitarian in nature "because
all were served in turn, no man served another and, furthermore, each was seated
according to the order in which he arrived, rather than that of precedence
usually encountered in the hierarchical Ottoman state."</p>

<p><strong>Humble beginnings</strong>: It came to England from Turkey in the early 17th century,
after some initial struggle, since some thought that "while ‘coffa’ agrees very
well with the constitution of the Turk, [...] it will not suit that of the
Englishman".  The first coffee-man in London, Pasqua Rosee, was a lowly coachman
in the service of Daniel Edwards. His customers, having bought their coffee,
assembled in groups under his awning, and Rosee’s enterprise was apparently
successful.  He was criticized under xenophobic pretenses, and his establishment
was far removed from the elegant and comfortable structures the merchants
remembered from their days in the Levant. On my last trip to London, I saw a
blue plaque celebrating his 1652 ‘coffee-house’, locating their memorial on the
walls of the Jamaica Wine House.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee House</strong>: Daniel Edwards and Thomas Hodges, however, could see the
commercial potential of coffee and were unwilling to let pass the opportunity
Rosee’s shop presented.  Eventually, a proper coffee-house emerged, with
dedicated, specially furnished coffee room, with its fires and stoves for warmth
and preparing coffee, was a retail revolution, although such places quickly lost
their strangeness.  In the fanatical environment of the Interregnum and
Restoration, the coffee-house to many was a haven of civility, but also of
revolution, debate, philosophy, puzzles, socialization, equality, and upward
mobility.</p>

<p><strong>Criticism</strong>: But of course there were critics, many skeptical of coffee house
style debate, which was often seen as shallow, critiqued as falling into four
particular qualities of ruined discourse: gabbling, gossip, wheedling and
idleness. Is it just a waste of time? ‘at this place a man is cheated of what
is, by far more valuable than Mony, that is, Time’. On the other hand, "the
wakeful sobriety of coffee made the coffee-house the natural ally of this
puritan ideology of work and labour". Coffee houses in Turkey came under threat
when the kadis signed a protocol describing the properties of coffee and
declaring it unlawful for Muslims. It was later repealed. In England, "The King
was propelled to issue the proclamation [banning coffee houses] in 1675 in
response to the increasingly fractious nature of political debate". This attempt
ultimately failed, and "the defence of the coffee-houses, it was understood, was
a defence of freedom of speech." Later in England, it was rumored "that coffee
there was widely deployed as a contraceptive" in Persia.</p>

<p>Coffee houses played a part in many of today's important institutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>News: "on entering, customers were as likely to call out ‘What news?’ as they
were to order a dish of coffee."</li>
<li>Auctions: "were conducted ‘by an inch of candle’, in which a section of wax
candle was lit, and bidding continued until the flame went out, with the final
bid carrying the lot."</li>
<li>Stock brokers: "jobbers bought and sold securities on their own account. These
men made a ready market by facilitating buying and selling, because if someone
wanted to sell, jobbers ensured they could always find a buyer."</li>
<li>US central banking: "group of prominent financiers to discuss proposals for a
bank to provide credit for the fledgling republic, modelled on the Bank of
England."</li>
<li>American Revolution: "In America the coffee-house was also associated with
news and rebellion through the eighteenth century."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>End of an era</strong>: In the late 17th century, "Tea was much more expensive than
coffee and it remained a rarity long after coffee was ubiquitous in London". It
later surpassed coffee, but remained something that was "more often associated
with women, with consumption in the home and with luxury: and most often in a
combination of all three". At its peak, there were 500 coffee houses in London,
but eventually Coffee started to wane. "Many blamed tea, and the passing of the
coffee-house was certainly accompanied by an unprecedented rise in tea drinking
among the British people". As early as 1750 coffee consumption in Britain had
been eclipsed by that of tea. Tea was monopolized by the East India Company,
which was "able to use its political influence to manipulate the system of
tariff preferences to distort the trade." By the early nineteenth century almost
six times as much tea was drunk per capita as coffee.  In 1888 a City
businessman wrote that the golden age of coffee-houses, as depicted in the light
literature of the last century, has passed away for ever.</p>

<p><strong>European rivals</strong>: "Paradoxically, while coffee-houses waned in Britain,
various Contintental rivals – the French café, the Italian caffè and the
Viennese Kaffeehaus – prospered, both in reality and in the mind even of the
British." While Manet seems to celebrate café life, works like Interior ofa
Café, The Café Concert (1879) and Corner of the Café Concert (1878) also
suggests a powerful sense of anomie: in the sociable spaces of the city few
people seem to connect with each other. But there are exceptions, such as Café
Central, in the Herrengasse, had a central court with a high glass roof,
originally constructed to serve as an exchange for the merchants. Countless
journalists, lawyers, school-teachers, tradesmen and merchants, made the
Kaffeehaus not simply a place to socialise over coffee and read newspapers, but
also a central location for their intellectual life. Still the closest analogy
for Viennese Kaffeehaus in England was with the tavern or public house.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso revolution</strong>: by WW2, "coffee disappeared off the market for more
than a decade, to be replaced by foul-tasting, adulterated imitations and
substitutes".  After the war, Riservato started the Gaggia Experimental Coffee
Bar, known also as the Riservato, in the summer of 1953, modeled after Italian
Caffes.  Within a year a legion of exotic new espresso bars had opened across
London and the provinces: The Times noted ‘the mushroom growth of espresso
coffee bars in London’ in October 1955. In San Francisco’s North Beach an
Italian immigrant opened Café Trieste in 1957. The ‘espresso revolution’, as
Pearson called it on BBC radio in 1956, changed more than just the appearance of
coffee retailing, reintroducing some of the sociability once associated with the
coffee-house. But, "The ubiquity of coffee bars, and the sameness of their
design, also mitigated their revolutionary sociability for Laski, who suggested
that many of the coffee-bar habitués would be as happy in a traditional tea
shop." The coffee bar was not simply a home for working-class or middle-class
culture, but a space where young people of different social stations mixed
freely, confusing the hierarchies of value both of Marxist and conservative
analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Seattleization</strong>: In 1966 a Dutch immigrant, Alfred Peet, opened a whole-bean
coffee bar at the corner of Vine and Walnut in Berkeley. As the home of the Beat
poets and student protest, cafés and coffee-shops played an important part in
nurturing San Francisco’s cultural revolution in the 1960s. In 1970 three
college graduates who shared an enthusiasm for Peet’s coffee banded together to
open a coffee shop in Pike Place Market in Seattle, doing their own roasting. 
One of their number, Jerry Baldwin, came up with ‘Starbuck’, a name with no
special meaning to them other than a pleasing sound and look. By 2003, Starbucks
was more than twenty times larger than its nearest rival in the American market
Schultz (Starbucks CEO) refers repeatedly to ‘the romance of coffee’. These
deep-seated associations, he argues, can be evoked through aroma, but also
through reiteration.</p>

<p><strong>Got milk</strong>: At Starbucks, and other Seattleised coffee-bar
chains, ordering a coffee has become a farcically complex operation requiring
specific and artificial terms. ‘wet’ means without foam, ‘skinny’ means to use
skimmed milk, ‘with wings’ means the coffee is to take away. Although the
chain’s consumption of milk is vast, almost no mention of its origins,
suppliers, chemistry, preparation or flavour. But milk was rarely added to
coffee before the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-social</strong>: The sociability encouraged by Starbucks is based on
consumption, not conversation. The interior arrangements of the coffee shop
recalls the communal space of the early coffee-house, but atomises people into
distinct individuals, promising customers peace and security from others, not
encounter and discussion. A plaintive symbol of these ambitions is seen in the
encouragement coffee-house chains have given to wifi by which means individuals
using their own laptops can participate in the on-line ‘community’ of the
Internet, all the while remaining oblivious of the living world around them.
In the sanitised, lactified form of the branded chain, the coffee-house is no
longer oppositional, rebellious and dissident. This is their profit, but our
loss.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet these will o’er their Jewish Liquor <br />
  About Religion Jar and Bicker; <br />
  And rave till grown as Piping Hot, <br />
  As the dull Grout o’er which they sot. <br />
  &mdash; Vulgus Britannicus: or The British Hudibras</p>

People have fully tamed their hormones, able to secrete anything at will, change
genders, heal wounds. Machines and humans co-exist with mutual respect. Tiny
drones and intergalactic starships are independent, intelligent entities with

    <title>Skin in the Game by Taleb (audio)</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Taleb is back with another book. It has interesting, but poorly organized ideas.
Fortunately, it is mercifully short acting more of a summary of his previous
work (I only read Antifragile). I don't think I could handle much more virtiol.</p>

<p>First, the interesting parts.</p>

<p>The thesis of "Skin in the Game" is that decision makers need to be
subject to the downsides that arise from their bad decisions, not just the
upside of their good ones. Skin in the game used to be normal: some kings and
emperors would fight on the front lines. Lords traded personal risk for
prominence. In modernity, many decision makers, such as bureaucrats that make
decisions on whether or not to go to war, are shielded from their actions. He
makes some interesting arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big companies want employees to be family men. Because they have more
dependents and thus debt. So they are less likely to leave. </li>
<li>Cato’s injunction: it's better to have someone ask why you don’t have a statue
rather than why you do. </li>
<li>VR can never be compelling since there's no downside risk to you. You have no
skin in the game. (This might be a leap I'm taking).</li>
<li>The Silver Rule - negative version of the golden rule: don’t do to others what
you wouldn’t want them to do to you. He expands on the definition of "you",
which is interestingly applied in the plural as well, to individuals,
families, tribes, countries. This is the libertarian version of the Golden
Rule.</li>
<li>Static vs. dynamic inequality: an important distinction. Wealth inequality is
not itself bad. It would be fair if people rotated through the wealth classes
over their lifetimes. Taleb claims that they do (which I highly doubt) and
this is his critique of Picketty.</li>
<li>But the fact that the market permits the prince become the pauper is an
example of skin in the game. And actually this status loss is super
relatable to people (eg. Trump).</li>
<li>Taleb is in favor of parsimony, and suspicious of an argument defended by too
many data points. This is his critique of Pinker's "everything is awesome"
narrative.</li>
<li>Lindy effect - for some non-perishable things, the longer something exists the
longer it will continue to exist.</li>
<li>Peer reviews are problematic because your peers aren’t necessarily the right
judges. Instead, time is the only judge. (I agree in theory, but in
practice, time takes too long).</li>
<li>Religion can affect actions and words. To the extent that religions affect
words, Taleb is fine with it. He claims most modern religions affect words
only, and there is no function difference between a Catholic and an Atheist.</li>
<li>Claims that Atheists like Dawkins &amp; Harris don't properly understand the
distinctions between various kinds of belief. In practice, everyone has some
"religious" practices like honoring the dead.</li>
<li>Rationality of a belief makes no sense. The only rationality that makes sense,
is that of an action, any only from the standpoint of survival. That which
helps you survive is rational. From this perspective, whether or not you can
explain something has no bearing on whether it’s rational or not. </li>
<li>Good reminder: correlation between deaths matters. Even though Ebola kills
fewer people than bathtubs, it’s still a bigger risk because it's an
infectuous disease, and so has huge downside. </li>
<li>Loss aversion isn't an irrational bias. It's rational to be fearful of ruin.</li>
<li>Summary statistics are often misleading. “Never cross a river if it is on
average 4ft deep”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taleb concludes with thought provoking advice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never engage in virtue signaling;</li>
<li>Never engage in rent-seeking;</li>
<li>You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business.</li>
</ol>

<p>I take issue with the tone in which the book is written. Taleb's level of hatred
towards some ideas and people, especially Steven Pinker is quite funny and
jarring. Whole chapters, such as the one devoted to Intellectuals Yet Idiots,
come off as a giant rant. He makes a lot of ridiculous claims which deserve to
be ignored or made fun of:</p>

<ul>
<li>He insults people as "not even weightlifters". I think this is a reference to
his obsession with deadlifting.</li>
<li>Taleb uses “domestication" as an insult. But the flip side is that this is the
basis of a functional social system. </li>
<li>He claims that employees are just like slaves. But employment is at-will on
both sides, and the trend today is away from "lifer"-dom.</li>
<li>He disparages academics because "talk is cheap", yet writes many books with
pompous names.</li>
<li>He claims that public speakers get nervous because of the stage lights in
their eyes.</li>
<li>Made up words like econophaster, psychosophaster and scientism aren't
winning him any favors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taleb is a provocoteur. But why? His ideas are actually quite academic and
intellectual, so he's not trying to appeal to populist masses. So who <strong>is</strong>
his target audience? Who knows? Anyway, I listened to this book, and it was
probably more worthwhile than listening to podcasts, but that's a pretty low
bar. I can't really recommend you do the same, so here are some interesting
names that Taleb mentions instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>Herb Simon - bounded rationality: people are fundamentally limited. (I've been
meaning to read him since being a CMU student.)</li>
<li>Gerd Gigerenzer - many things appear illogical but are actually done for good
reasons. </li>
<li>Ken Binmore - the word “rational” is ill defined. It’s all about revealed
preferences. </li>
</ul>

    <title>The Modern Political Tradition: Hobbes to Habermas</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>An impressively comprehensive series of 36 half-hour <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/The-Modern-Political-Tradition-Hobbes-to-Habermas-Audiobook/B00K58X53Q">lectures on political
philosophy</a>. I wanted a political philosophy survey to better understand
some of the political articles I've been reading in Foreign Affairs, as well as
have a better sense of context for the current moment. </p>

<p>The lecturer, Lawrence Cahoone, is an engaging speaker, and organized the
material really well. He goes chronologically through some of modernity's most
influential political philosophers, and summarizes their most important ideas.
I found that Cahoone was able to summarize the philosophers I was familiar with
pretty succinctly, although of course it's very hard to avoid
oversimplification. I was also surprised by how many thinkers I hadn't even
heard of.</p>

<p>This was not an easy course to follow for a layperson like me. I found myself
having to re-listen to some of the more dense lectures multiple times before I
felt like I grasped the concepts. Some philosphers remain shrowded in mystery.
Most notably, Hegel and Strauss continue to defy summarization. In the latter
lectures, he does a great job of tying more modern and controversial ideas
surrounding feminism and multiculturalism back to older thinkers.</p>

<p>Here are some of the philosophers he covers, as well as brief summaries for me
to index on later. As a note to myself, here are ones that I thought were most
interesting, and would be worth delving into in more depth: Carl von Clausewitz,
Alexis de Tocqueville, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Leonard Hobhouse, Hannah
Arendt, Friedrich von Hayek, Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre, William
Galston, Michael Waltzer, Carol Gilligan, Charles Taylor, Aldo Leopold, Jürgen
Habermas, Benjamin Barber, Ernest Gelner. What follow are a survey of a survey,
brief notes on each philosopher that was mentioned in the course.</p>

<h2>Formation of Liberal Republicanism (Lectures 3 - 16)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plato - we need a philosopher king.</li>
<li>Machiavelli - Realpolitik. Politics is amoral. The enemy of my enemy is my
friend.</li>
<li>Hobbes - the state of nature is a war of all against all. In the social
contract, you give up rights for security. (Social contract)</li>
<li>Locke - people have natural rights to life, liberty and property. The
government isn’t your master, it’s your servant. (Liberty)</li>
<li>Rousseau - the noble savage was better off than the modern man because
everyone was equal. Independence, equality and community are most important.
"Man is born free yet is everywhere in chains". (Equality)</li>
<li>Kant - morals are derived from reason and not experience. And you must always
act according to the categorical imperative. Kant is a non-consequentialist,
outcome doesn’t matter. (Deontology)</li>
<li>Adam Smith - self-interest can be good. The invisible hand guides private self
interest to create public benefit. (Emergence, Markets)</li>
<li>Montesquieu - checks and balances will prevent despotism. Separate powers into
legislative, executive and judicial branches. (Checks and Balances)</li>
<li>Jefferson - inherited wealth and inherited debt is bad for society.</li>
<li>Hamilton - too much federation is bad, leads to internal conflict. Feared
“Petty republics without any shared unifying purposes”. Centralize for
strength: banks, patent office, etc.</li>
<li>Madison - tyranny of the majority is real. States/communities should have
equal power in some sense (eg. electoral college, 2 senators per state)</li>
<li>Richard Price - the French rightfully replaced King’s with laws. In favor of
elections and explicit consent. (Republicanism)</li>
<li>Edmund Burke - England depends on traditional institutions: royalty, the
church.  Political norms don't come from reason but from tradition.
(Conservatism)</li>
<li>Thomas Payne - there is no power above the people other than god. Natural
rights exist, according to reason. Burke is irrational, tradition is bad.</li>
<li>Joseph de Maistre (far right) - nature is inherently evil. Man must submit
soul to god and body to the state. The order is not rational.
(Counter-enlightenment)</li>
<li>William Godwin (far left) - government coercion is bad. Moral individuality and
rationally derived conduct is good. (Anarchy)</li>
<li>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (far far left) - there is no such thing as absolute
dominion. Property rights over indefinite timescale don’t make sense.
(Anarchy)</li>
<li>Leo Tolstoy - war and church are sources of violent coercion. Violence is
always evil even when monopolized by government. Logical continuation from
turning the other cheek from Christ. (Anarchic pacifism)</li>
<li>Johann Gottlieb Fichte - "For each people, a country, for each country, a
people". This means pan-German unification, mass literacy, etc. A sort of
celebration of diversity on a country level. (Nationalism)</li>
<li>Napoleon - The draft changed warfare forever. No more chivalrous knights,
fealty for the king and hired mercenaries. Just a 600k strong standing army.
(Conscription)</li>
<li><strong>Carl von Clausewitz</strong> - "War is the continuation of politics by other means".
"Real war" is ritualized, chivalrous, traditional. But "ideal war" is pure
conflict, fewer rules, objective is to make your opponents surrender. (War
theory)</li>
<li>Isaiah Berlin - negative liberty (freedom from x, liberty from coercion) vs
positive liberty (freedom to do y, self determination). Positive liberty means
there are multiple “goods”, requiring a pluralistic society.</li>
<li>Hegel - Everything has a thesis, a counter thesis, and then a synthesis
combining both. (Dialectic?)</li>
<li><strong>Alexis de Tocqueville</strong> - Traditional society gave aristocratic individuals
freedom, provided structures of mutual obligation. Modern citizens are
independent free and equal but alone so the government will have to do many
things that family, guilds, feudal structures did before. But in America this
can be mitigated with clubs, churches, other “civil society” outside of
politics. (Civil society)</li>
<li>Jeremy Bentham and James Mill - natural rights is “nonsense on stilts”, the
guiding star is general utility. And this means what people actually value
(from experience, not kantian intuition). Bentham: “push-pin (a children's
game) is as good as poetry” (Utilitarianism)</li>
<li>John Stuart Mill - there is a hierarchy of pleasures. “It is better to be a human
dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a
fool satisfied.” Act to maximize total pleasure overall. Also the harm
principle: be free up to the point of harming others. Harm here
is specifically utilitarian (eg. affecting others concretely, ie. not eating
pork in private). Diversity of opinion is important, marketplace of ideas
brings us closer to the truth. (Liberalism)</li>
<li>Henry J. S. Maine - the individual surpasses the family as the unit to which
law applies. (Individualism)</li>
<li>Eric Weil - loss of community is part of modernity in favor of a looser
association and voluntary groups.</li>
<li><strong>Émile Durkheim</strong> - Modern society is characterized by specialization.
Traditional society was fractal - every hunter gatherer group was the same,
now they vary. (Specialization)</li>
<li>Georg Simmel - Money dehumanizes.</li>
<li><strong>Max Weber</strong> - work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity
is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends.
Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to
a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an
all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)</li>
<li>Friedrich Nietzsche - "God is dead" and modern society is sick. What are the
values that increase the viability of a society? Definitely not equality,
since without ambition it turns mankind into a herd. Need Übermensch to
transcend the Judeo-Christian tradition by finding meaning in chaotic
modernity.</li>
<li>Sigmund Freud - people are still basically primitive and have drives that
contradict modern values. This leads to inevitable regressions like world war
1 and 2.  (Drive theory)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Crisis of Liberal Republicanism from 1914 to 1953 (Lectures 17 - 20)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Leonard Hobhouse</strong> - Laissez faire capitalism didn’t work and reduced the
world to “Manchesterism” - terrible industrial dystopia. Sought a softer mix
of liberalism and socialism. “Organic liberalism” is consequentialist, and
should improve society. People are inherently social, and any impact they have
must be reflected there. Communitarian, interactionist, prescient.</li>
<li>William J. Brian - empower the poor against the elites. Hallmark of populism
is railing against the economic hegemony and social
conservatism. (Populism)</li>
<li>Roosevelt - large monopolies have too much power. The wealthy few form a
tyranny of the minority. 3 C’s: consumer protection, control of corporations,
conservation of natural resources. A shift to more presidential/executive
power to reform the constitution and modernize it.</li>
<li>Wilson - again shift to more presidential power. Checks and balances are too
constraining. Political society is evolving.</li>
<li>Eduard Bernstein - capitalism will evolve to be more socialist organically,
and markets don’t need to be fully abolished. What’s important is that workers
are treated better. (Soft socialism)</li>
<li>Lenin - communism won’t come on its own. Bernstein is a political prostitute.
Communism needs a revolution and a hard line proletarian government that is
wholly dedicated to ushering the new era. Freedom isn’t possible until then so
all spheres of life, including art, must serve this goal. (Totalitarian
socialism)</li>
<li>György Lukács / Theodor Adorno / Max Horkheimer - capitalism lacks any
reference point from which to criticize it. It commodifies everything too
well. But despite western leanings they were quite sympathetic to Leninism.
“parliamentary democracy is like having a debate club at the edge of the
abyss.” The enlightenment wears away at beliefs, so all that remains is power.</li>
<li>Georges Sorel - True morality requires martial virtue, readiness for violence,
and self sacrifice. (Anarcho syndicalism)</li>
<li>Carl Schmitt - Fascism is an enlightened rationalist dictatorship. Politics is
above economics, morality, etc. Social contract theory is wrong. Even Locke
wanted there to be an emergency valve where the executive branch takes over.
But then the executive must also decide if there’s an emergency in the first
place. Ultimately it comes down to a non-rational decision. It’s a theological
politics. (Fascism)</li>
<li>Peter Drucker - Fascism is disappointed socialism. Need something less
international, less economic centric. Especially in light of standing armies
of WW1, nationalism is key, and there needs to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Mg6Gfh9Co">bigger
idea</a>. (Nationalism)</li>
<li><p><strong>Hannah Arendt</strong> - totalitarianism of Hitler and Stalin is unlike anything
that came before. Total organization of society is mobilized for the state.
Nothing remains of civil society. No more art or chess for its own sake. She
characterized Nazis as banality of evil, just following orders while comma
unthinkable atrocities. (Totalitarianism) Distinction between labor, work, and
action:</p>

<ul>
<li>Labor is recurring and pure maintenance: cooking, dishes, chores,
ephemeral output.</li>
<li>Work results in durable output: fixing the car, wiring poetry.</li>
<li>Action: deeds and speeches of free and equal individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>For Arendt, action &gt; work &gt; labor, but modernity focuses too much on economics
and so devalues work in favor of labor and action in favor of work. Powerful
argument against both capitalism and marxism framed in art. For capitalists,
the value of art is financial, for marxists, it's instrumental: for the sake
of advancing communism. For her, it's intrinsic.</p></li>
<li>Giulio Douhet - since so much depends on military technology, produced in
factories, factories and civilians are legitimate targets.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Political theory during the Cold War (Lectures 21 - 24)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Michael Oakeshott - political behavior cannot be deduced from rationalism alone.
Politics can be engineered and must be guided by practical knowledge. Great
analogy to recipes: you need cooking skills to make a great dish, not just
rule following.</li>
<li>Ludwig von Mises - a planned economy is actually impossible. It’s too complex.
Markets have emergent properties and no central planner can know it.
(Anti-communist)</li>
<li><strong>Friedrich von Hayek</strong> - Government should ensure equal rights but not equal
outcomes. Avowed anti-rationalist, believes in limitations of rationality, and
so spontaneous order created by multiple individuals. Markets are both good
and bad, you must have losers to have winners. The market must remain free,
but the losers can be propped up by the government. The market isn’t a
meritocracy, but based around value, or willingness to pay. Hayek is in
favor of free market regulation, for some domains: safety, sanitation,
breaking up monopolies, even health care. The worst is when prices, wages, and
production schedules are fixed by the government because it breaks emergent
spontaneity.</li>
<li>Milton Friedman - in favor of negative income tax or basic income. Opposed to
professional licensing run by governments. (Libertarianism)</li>
<li>Leo Strauss - Philosophy is fundamentally always inconclusive. Athens vs
Jerusalem: religion has all of the answers, but the ancient philosophers could
deal with the uncertainty of taking philosophy seriously.</li>
<li>Alexandre Kojève - history ended with Napoleon and Hegel. No more
qualitative changes in human thinking.</li>
<li>Herbert Marcuse - Advanced capitalism is totalitarian, integrating everything
into itself. Example: music that may have begun as counter culture like jazz,
hip hop, rock eventually gets played at the Super Bowl. In post capitalism,
work becomes play. “One dimensional man” was the Bible for the new left and
SDS of the 60s (New Left)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Domestic political arguments (Lectures 25 - 28)</h2>

<ul>
<li>John Rawls - what distribution of material wealth is just? Socialists usually
focus on outcomes, neoliberals on history. Rawls is a progressive deontologist.
Veil of Ignorance forces people to make ideal laws for a society without
knowing what their position will be. In this case, take the maximin approach:
best worst case. The only acceptable inequality is due to talent &amp; hard work,
not birth status. “Fair opportunity“. Difference principle: remove inequality
until it hurts the least advantages. Contrast to Pareto efficiency principle,
which doesn't care about individuals, but just overall outcome. (Fair
opportunity)</li>
<li>Ayn Rand - hates altruism from a Nietzsche perspectives. Selfishness is good
because people have value in themselves. So capitalism is the only moral
system of government. Society is only great in so far as it’s individuals are
great. In favor of minimal states: optional taxes for police and military.
(Objectivism)</li>
<li>Robert Nozick - Any distribution scheme is unjust because it requires too much
intervention to maintain. Inevitably people will gain a promotion or lose a
job, disrupting the distribution. Also you don’t owe anyone for your fortune
in life: analogy of musician who plays outside your house and then comes with
a bill the next day - you don’t owe them. The veil of ignorance is contrived.
It works for “life boat” cases and other emergency cases, but not in society
where how you got your money matters. Imagine living your life based on how
others want you to live, and you sell shares in your decisions. This is the
opposite of free society, some degree of slavery. (Libertarianism)</li>
<li><strong>Michael Sandel</strong> - Rawls and Nosick are wrong because some values are unchosen:
community, family, etc. the rest are chosen on top. In some cases, individual
liberty can impact community from which that individual liberty is partly
derived. Therefore some things should not become commodities to be bought and
sold: a mother child relationship, surrogacy, outsourcing child rearing etc is
wrong. (Communitarianism)</li>
<li><strong>Alasdair MacIntyre</strong> - Meaning can only be found in narrative, which is
based on the culture and community you belong to. He rejects modernism and
prefers premodern Aristotle to postmodern Nietzsche.</li>
<li><strong>William Galston</strong> - positive liberalism is important but is one of many
worthy values. He rejects moral monism (foxes &gt; hedgehogs) and thinks these
values are in general conflict. Ultimate values are: life itself,
purposiveness, instrumental rationality.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Waltzer</strong> - distributive justice is important but not why Rawls
thinks. A just distribution of a good depends on the good and cultural
conditions. Food, swimming pools, education are all different so distribution
should vary.  What is bad about income inequality? Tyranny of one type
of good over another: it’s that money can buy everything: security,
healthcare, better cars, sex, political influence, commutation (avoiding the
draft). It’s bad when different “spheres of justice” become too asymmetrical.
Free market rules only apply to the bazaar, but treating everything as commerce
ruins things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feminism, Multiculturalism, Environmentalism, Postmodernism (Lectures 29 - 32)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Susan Okin - progressive justice doesn’t take into account women’s special
rights. Women in reality make less, so no fault marriage is equal but unjust.
Wife beating is political in the same way that racially motivated crime is.
The private is political. Women are generally more focused on the private.
(Feminism)</li>
<li><strong>Carol Gilligan</strong> - normal development for humans is masculinized by society.
In fact women are fundamentally different (essentialist). Men think in terms
of rights and rules. Women focus more on care, community.</li>
<li>Iris Marion Young - identity is often construed as negative. Example: Who am
I? I’m not like this cis-gendered white male! Critical of negative identity
because individuals belong to many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Charles Taylor</strong> - all cultures deserve to be recognized but what is their
respective value? Should Shakespeare and Achebe get the same amount of
coverage in school? Cultures are of equal value is nonsensical, muzzles
critical powers.</li>
<li>Bhikhu Parekh - the majority culture should adjust to its immigrants. For
example, wearing a turban is a disadvantage for motorcycling, hence the Sikh
helmet exception law in the UK, which is just to normalize the disadvantage.</li>
<li>Brian Barry - individuals should not be disadvantaged by the groups they are
born into. The Amish must stop preventing their children from going to high
school. (Assimilation)</li>
<li>Will Kymlicka - in liberalism, a group has as much rights as the sum total of
rights of its individuals. But this doesn’t work for small groups like
indigenous tribes. This gets tricky if liberties undermine the culture of the
minority community. (Multiculturalism)</li>
<li>John Muir - preserve nature as it is because it is sacred. (Preservation)</li>
<li>Gifford Pinchot - conserve nature but still allow it to be used for human
purposes. (Managed Conservation)</li>
<li>Peter Singer - argues for animal welfare on a utilitarian basis. Their
suffering should be reduced wherever possible. Applies to mammals and probably
birds and amphibians. Speciesism is the analogue of sexism, racism etc.
(Animal rights)</li>
<li>Tom Regan - non human animals have deontological rights. They have an identity
and so have inherent value and rights. (Kantian animal rights)</li>
<li><strong>Aldo Leopold</strong> - animals eat one another in the wild, but we now have
control over ecosystems. We must "think like a mountain". This is a
communitarian approach often driven by the desire to keep biodiversity high.
(Moral ecology)</li>
<li>Richard Rorty - there is no non circular justification for any philosophical
argument. (Anti-foundationalism)</li>
<li>Jean-François Lyotard -  everything is mediated by culture, which</li>
<li>manifests as a series of signs. Beyond that, it’s all language games. (Radical
structuralism)</li>
<li>Michel Foucault - truth is defined by society and is intended for controlling
the people. Society has constructed its canon out of straight white men. This
is a problem, and blacks, women, and homosexuals need to be brought into the
fray. Biases inherent in western ideals, feminist, multicultural ideas are
all legacies. (Postmodernism)</li>
<li><p><strong>Jürgen Habermas</strong> - attempts to defend enlightenment and modernism from both
Nietzsche postmodernism and conservative premodernism. Expands notion of
rationality to communication. Kinds of rationality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Epistemically rationality: what is true.</li>
<li>Instrumental rationality: rational action.</li>
<li>Communicative rationality (Habermas): we can decide together what we should
do. If what parties are saying is expressed dishonestly, it’s strategic
communication.</li>
</ul>

<p><p>Democracy is all about communicative rationality. There is a conflict between
“the system” and the “lifeworld”, first of which is money and power driven,
second is democratic communicative action. System infringes on the life world:
less is decided conversationally and more moneyed.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Post cold war (Lectures 33 - 35)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Francis Fukuyama - History is about the slaves seeking and achieving equality
(Hegel, Kojev). We're well on our way now, and nothing will really beat
liberal democracy ever. Problem is that the end-state (universal equality) is
bad because it leads to Nietzches “last man”, an ambitionless passiveness. So
there must be room for individual thriving, or Thumos. (End of History)</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin Barber</strong> - We accidentally flooded the world with mcworld, the 3
Ms: McDonald’s, Macintosh, MTV, but not with the civil society requires for
democracy. “Neither Jihad nor McWorld promises a remotely democratic future”.
Model: Tocqueville. (Jihad vs. McWorld)</li>
<li>Samuel Huntington - Culture matters to how states govern.  Listen 9 modern
civilizations: Eastern Europe, greater China, Islamic belt, India, Japan, etc.
Conflicts will occur at the borders between these civilizations.  Western
culture is not replicable. Elements are exportable, but it won’t be a full
package. Globalism will increase tension and resistance because identity is
often constructed negatively. (The Clash of Civilizations)</li>
<li><strong>Ernest Gelner</strong> - airlifting free elections and market economy into Soviet
block countries isn’t sufficient. What you need is modern civil society, by
which he means a plurality of ideas: neither church, nor market, nor govt can
dominate. Life is modular and each part follows different rules. So pluralism
is key. In the West this loss of identity was OK because of nationalism. Most
countries are no longer Ideocracies (single moral idea, no pluralism) with the
exception of those dominated by political Islam. </li>
<li>Mahatma Gandhi/Martin Luther King - forceful non violent resistance but
inspired by Tolstoy. (Non-violent resistance)</li>
<li>William T. Sherman - open to war as needed. "War is hell". (War Realism)</li>
<li><strong>Michael Waltzer</strong> (this time on war) - War is sometimes justified but is
regimented by rules for going to war and then conduct during war. (Contrast to
Just War Pacifism, which thinks modern technology is too dangerous to ever
use.) Codified in Geneva and Hague conventions.  But tricky for civil wars:
are the rebels criminals (to be punished) or combatants (protected by Geneva)?
Terror against civilians is never ok, and tricky for combatants. Peacekeeping
is justified if the target country is no longer able to guarantee rights to
its people ("the right to have rights"). For example if there’s a genocide the
country is unable to protect its citizens or is complicit in the act and must
be stopped. Less clear who needs to intervene though. Dirty hands: politicians
cannot be deontologists but must consider the utilitarian outcome for their
people. (Just War theory)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great overview of some philosophical underpinning of politics. I
learned a ton, gleaming new things about philosophers I was already familiar
with because of superior summarization, and learning about completely new
philosophers I hadn't even heard of before. Well worth a listen, and a
re-listen.</p>
