        <p>This is a Jewish take on parenting from a former psychologist who became disenchanted with her profession and sought wisdom in the tradition of her ancestors. I found myself nodding along in agreement to many of her ideas, which try to synthesize Jewish concepts with "common sense" parenting. Less charitably, this book can also be seen as a conservative reaction to modern parenting trends. Either way, a better than average parenting book. Thanks to LL for the recommendation.</p>
<p>Some things I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A paradox</strong>: parents aren't happy when there is nothing psychologically wrong with her child. If that's the case, then there's nothing to fix and the problem doesn't just go away through some clear intervention.</li>
<li><strong>A parable</strong>: keep one sheet of paper in each the left and right pockets of your jacket. The left note should say "I am a speck of dust", and the right should say "the world was created for me". Mogel refers to this classic parable from Rabbi Simcha Boonim. This spirit of keeping multiple lenses as well as being able to entertain opposite extremes is such an important skill for parents and a key part of how I want to be in the world.</li>
<li><strong>An insight into the first commandment</strong> "I am the Lord your God". This isn't a commandment in itself, as it doesn't really entail any action. Despite this, it serves as a preamble to the rest of the ten commandments, adding appropriate gravitas. Similarly, reminding children "I am your father" (but not like Darth Vader) may tautological, but is actually effective.</li>
<li><strong>Deed over creed</strong> is a great terse summary of the Jewish approach to na'aseh v'nishma (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Jewish_tradition_of_doing_first_and_understanding_later_-_na'aseh_v'nishma">Jewish tradition of doing first and understanding later - na'aseh v'nishma</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Yetzer Hara</strong>. Humans have a congenital inclination to do evil, but there can be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yetzer_hara#Positive_role_of_the_evil_inclination">positive role to the evil inclination</a>. What is the worst behavior of your child? The attributes that cause it might also lead to their greatest strength. If this "evil inclination" is something that has potential for positivity, perhaps it is a misnomer for chaos? This evokes the D&amp;D concept of chaotic good which separates the simple axis of good and evil into the more complex 2x2. I also wrote a previous note along similar lines (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Embracing_deviance_as_a_value">Embracing deviance as a value</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Mishegas</strong> — a great Yiddish term for non-clinical craziness.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I wanted to debate with the author:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mogel claims that children are asked to be generalists in a way that is unreasonable and never again relevant for adult life. My take on this is highly inspired by books like <a href="/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/">Range - Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein</a>, which suggest that generalism in adults is underrated. In "Range", Epstein suggests that children should try a wide variety of activities to increase match quality.</li>
<li>Mogel observes that many find the word "God" to be awkward to say, and that we ought to get over it. For me, "God" is a weird word to say mainly because it's so closely associated with trite concepts related to Jesus and a simple conception of God as a sort of bearded superman in the sky. Abstract Jewish terms like HaShem (literally "The Name") is a good workaround I think, although HaShem in particular connotes a deep religiosity which I do not possess. Does anyone call it "The Lord"? Sounds formal and creepy but kinda cool. Maybe I should try calling it "The Name"?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, a parenting book should have parenting advice! I left "Skinned Knee" with many promising parenting ideas to incorporate into our life, but I'll spare you those details.</p>

        <p>Annihilation was first recommended to me by KO. This book is a creepy combination of Roadside Picnic and Soylent Green. It was advertised to me as Sci-Fi, but I think it really leans into horror, which is Jeff VanderMeer's specialty.</p>
<p>I found this to be a captivating read with a very rich atmosphere, despite the world building being extremely shrouded in uncertainty. Nothing can be trusted. Neither your senses nor your sensors. The vibes this book emanates are unlike anything else I can remember. Reading this book gave me a perpetual sense of Déjà vu.</p>
<p>Annihilation was a very quick read. I don't plan to read the rest of the books in the Southern Cross trilogy yet, although I am somewhat intrigued. I hope that the next book reveals something about the authorities that send missions to Area X. I found this to be the most fruitfully mysterious part for a sequel.</p>
<p>Let me speculate about the book overall and provide my overall theory of what is happening in Area X. This is based on a book club discussion with VK, MM, MK &amp; AK. What if Area X is a generalized next token predictor that uses human cells as its tokens? The gibberish writing spiraling inside the tower could have easily been generated by an LLM. What if this whole world of Area X is an LLM in biological space?</p>

    <title>A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold</title>

      <div>
        <p>Inspired to read more about ecology after enjoying <a href="/books/mystery-teachings-by-j-m-greer/">Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth by J. M. Greer</a>, I picked up "Sand County Almanac". I'm not sure how I managed to miss this gem for so long.</p>
<p>Aldo Leopold was an ecosystems' genius, and this most famous book of his contains deep analysis couched in poetic but accessible prose. Leopold was one of the O.G. environmentalists, perhaps an east coast John Muir? I really loved this collection of essays, especially "Good Oak", "Axe in Hand" and "The Land Ethic". These three essays stand alone, contain great quotes, and should be required reading.</p>
<h1>Good Oak</h1>
<p>In his "Good Oak" chapter, Leopold recalls felling a dead oak, peeling back the layers of time as his saw cuts through each annual circle in the cross-section of the tree. As he does this, Leopold recalls the history of his 80 acre Sand County farm from an Oak's perspective. This is such a great device, noticed by others as well, as in this blog post entitled <a href="https://forestbathingcentral.com/tree-ring-span-storytelling/">Tree Ring-Span Storytelling</a>. I loved this quote from the chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Axe in Hand</h1>
<p>"Axe in Hand" focuses on the almost god-like role of farmers, and a deep discussion on bias (along the lines of my <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Maybe_biases_are_good">Maybe biases are good</a>). Leopold muses on why he prefers pine trees to birches, digging deeply and honestly to try to understand why. I'm impressed at the number of possible reasons he produces to favor the pine, but ultimately concedes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only conclusion I have ever reached is that I love all trees, but I am in love with pines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farmers decide which plants should live and which should die. Improvements to farming tools are all still fundamentally concerned with doing these god-like activities more efficiently. It's an interesting sentiment expressed many years later, in 1968 by Stewart Brand "We are as gods and might as well get good at it". Leopold quotes "Tristram" by Edwin Arlington Robinson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you will or not
You are a King, Tristram, for you are one
Of the time-tested few that leave the world,
When they are gone, not the same place it was.
Mark what you leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The Land Ethic</h1>
<p>In "The Land Ethic", Leopold describes a model for the natural world he calls the land pyramid. This is similar to the food chain, except with soil as the foundation. Leopold observes that soil is not just a place to plant things, but the substrate in which life can evolve and flourish.</p>
<p>The land pyramid tends to grow in height over evolutionary time, increasing in complexity as life figures out increasingly clever adaptations and ways of being. Leopold laments the loss of megafauna and other apex predators due to human over-hunting, as this flattened the land pyramid for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>Leopold describes his conservationist philosophy in a few choice quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethical behavior is doing the right thing when no one else is watching- even when doing the wrong thing is legal.</p>
<p>We are remodeling the Alhambra with a steam-shovel, and we are proud of our yardage. We shall hardly relinquish the shovel, which after all has many good points, but we are in need of gentler and more objective criteria for its successful use.</p>
<p>A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the narrative, Leopold intertwines natural phenomena that were new to me and raised many questions in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rabbits apparently girdle Oak trees. (What does girdling mean? What is the rabbit-tree symbiosis he alludes to?)</li>
<li>You can apparently tell how good a year was by the vertical spacing between branches on the trunk. (How do trees grow? How do bones grow?)</li>
<li>I am really intrigued by this sky dance that the Woodcock does. They are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3-LvmHM4E">hilarious birds</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Sand County Almanac" is well worth a read or a listen.</p>

    <title>Disappearance of Ritual by Byung-Chul Han</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I recently read <a href="/books/the-burnout-society-by-byung-chul-han/">The Burnout Society by Byung-Chul Han</a>, a chaotic, disorganized read full of interesting ideas. "Disappearance of Ritual" continues in the same tradition, but I found the ideas presented in it somewhat weaker and less original than in "Burnout Society". In one section, BCH extols the virtues of beautiful and playful language and laments its disappearance. Yet he writes woeful passages like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delirious contiguity is the poetic principle of wit. The signifiers licentiously enter into neighborly relations without giving any consideration to the signified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blemishes aside, there are some diamonds in the rough in this work, but nothing really jumped at me as totally earth-shattering.</p>
<p><strong>Echoes of The Sabbath</strong>: BCH explores the analogy that rituals are to time like dwellings are to space. Citing Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, "rituals are temporal techniques of making oneself at home in the world". Similarly, he uses rest as a sort of sacred ritual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rest is not merely recovery from work, nor is it a preparation for further work. Rather, it transcends work, and it must in no way come into contact with work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bizarrely, he does not quote <a href="/books/the-sabbath-by-heschel/">The Sabbath by Heschel</a> which contains very similar ideas and predates Saint-Exupéry's "Citadelle" by 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>If Rituals did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Them</strong>: BCH laments the loss of rituals in our modern society. Somewhat along the lines of <a href="/books/the-power-of-ritual-by-casper-ter-kuile/">The Power of Ritual by Casper ter Kuile</a>, he suggests that rituals make life more enjoyable, give form to our lifecycles, and bring variety. Because our society has given up on rituals, they need to be synthesized along the slightly cringe lines described in "Power of Ritual" and observed in rationalist solstices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The demand for individually designed rites to mark the phases of life and their transitional points is also on the increase, with the place of priests now taken by so-called ritual designers. These novel rituals have to obey the imperative of authenticity and creativity. But they are not rituals in the proper sense. They do not exert the symbolic force which directs life towards something higher and thus provides meaning and orientation. Where there is no longer a higher order, rituals disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A ritualistic life is also less depressing. BCH argues forcefully that there can be no depression in a ritualistic society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a society governed by ritual, there is no depression. In such a society, the soul is fully absorbed by ritual forms; it is even emptied out. Rituals contain aspects of the world, and they produce in us a strong relationship to the world. Depression, by contrast, is based on an excessive relation to self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I this is overstated and that BCH presents an overly romantic view of ritualistic societies. That said, I have seen how needing to synthesize your own rituals leads people to a place of "narcissistic introspection" and depression.</p>
<p><strong>Learning things by heart is underrated</strong>. I resonated with this idea, and I'll let BCH speak for himself here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, many forms of repetition, such as learning by heart, are scorned on account of the supposed stifling of creativity and innovation they involve.</p>
<p>The cultural technique of deep attention emerged precisely out of ritual and religious practices. It is no accident that ‘religion’ is derived from relegere: to take note... Rituals are characterized by repetition. Repetition differs from routine in its capacity to create intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Politeness as ritual</strong> that produces a positive mental state in all parties. Yet politeness is at odds with authenticity, and the latter wins in modernity. Quoting William James's "<a href="https://archive.org/details/onvitalreserves02jamegoog/page/n51/mode/2up">Gospel of Relaxation</a>" fake it till you make it ethos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to feel kindly towards a person to whom we have been inimical, the only way is more or less deliberately to smile, to make sympathetic inquiries, and to force ourselves to say genial things. One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BCH and I find deep wisdom in this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A ritual of politeness is not an expression of subjective feeling; it is an objective act. It resembles a magical invocation that produces a positive mental state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ritual made ancient warfare better</strong>. Towards the second half of the book, BCH goes on all sorts of wild tangents, covering a broad range of "bads", from capitalism to pornography in all sorts of blanket statements. It was sort of hard to extract value from the fragments there.</p>
<p><strong>Modernity compresses life's dynamic range</strong>. BCH laments a sort of dynamic range compression over all spheres of life. On the play end of the continuum, leisure has been dumbed down to binge-watching Netflix, a far cry from the word's original sense, the freedom to pursue education in a way not directly concerned with productivity and profit. On the other end of the continuum, peak experiences lack "splendor, sovereignty, and intensity"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only weak play is tolerated, and it forms a functional element within production. The sacred seriousness of play has entirely given way to the profane seriousness of work and production. Life subordinated to the dictates of health, optimization and performance comes to resemble mere survival. It lacks splendor, sovereignty, intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an incomplete thought, but a quote from Juvenal stuck with me, which is BCH's way of describing the modern condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"losing the reasons to live for the sake of staying alive" (propter vitam vivendi perdere causas)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My romanticized analogy to the startup world is that entrepreneurs escape this form of weak play which predominates inside large corporations. Instead, they risk more and live with the prospect of honor and glory.</p>
<p><strong>Ritualized warfare was better</strong>. Continuing on this of "strong play", BCH extends his observations to war. The way he tells it, ancient warfare was ritualized and game-like, with sovereign warriors as players, unafraid of death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prohibition of certain weapons and the agreement on the time and place of battle underline the play-like character of war in the ancient world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ancient generals would be at the front of a column leading the charge. Alexander the Great was famously willing to put everything on the line for the sake of achieving his vision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the chivalric code, which had a decisive influence on the development of the notion of military honor in Europe, it is not honorable to attack an enemy without putting yourself at risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast, modern warfare involves soldiers, which in his BCH-ish fashion, literally translates as "the one who is in someone's pay", from salary and salt. He risks his life not because he is a live player (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Live_player_vs_dead_player">Live player vs dead player</a>), but because he receives payment for it. And honor is rarely taken into account, with cynicism and realpolitik the dominant stances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules of the game to which all belligerents commit themselves ensure that, after the war is over, there is space left for politics. By contrast, killing without rules, pure violence, destroys the political space. War as large-scale dueling differs fundamentally from the kind of military action we see today, which is increasingly degenerating into ruthless killing.</p>

    <title>Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I picked this one up on Sr. B's recommendation and enjoyed it in multi-voice audiobook form. Overall, a fun listen. Very (in-)effable(?). Lots of jokes and satirical observations reminiscent of Doug Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and I think way more Pratchett than Gaiman.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but wonder which of the two authors identified and wrote more of the demon Crowley and the angel Aziraphale. Their hilarious love-hate dynamic reminded me of the starkly different and far more self-serious duo depicted in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/This_is_How_You_Lose_the_Time_War">This is How You Lose the Time War</a>.</p>
<p>On that more serious note, Good Omens explores the possibility of Angels, Demons, and God having a free will. As the end of the world nears it becomes clear that the great conflict of this book is not between good and evil. Both sides act wrongly, and dream only of a war of total annihilation in which one of them wins and the other loses. A zero-sum game. In a real sense, the Biblical "good" is also evil.</p>
<p>Instead, the real struggle is between forces that want the world to end, and those that, despite all imperfections, would prefer it to continue. Framed this way, I am reminded a lot of Carse (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Finite_and_Infinite_Games_by_James_Carse">Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse</a>). And when the world of course doesn't end, my stance against millenarianism is only strengthened (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Millenarianism_is_always_wrong">Millenarianism is always wrong</a>).</p>
<p>Little notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adam Young is well named</li>
<li>"Piss artist" is a great expression</li>
<li>I knew all the "ineffable" jokes seemed familiar, and I must have recalled Dirk Gently, to whom I leave the last word:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable, let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.</p>

    <title>Mystery Teachings by J. M. Greer</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/mystery-teachings-by-j-m-greer"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Ecology, complexity, and other interdisciplinary fields can easily slip into woo. Initially I expected this book to suffer from this problem, but luckily there were no dizzying invocations of Deepak Chiopra™ style quantum physics. Instead, Greer presents a grounded worldview, rejecting spiritual stereotypes and "half truths that you create your own reality".</p>
<p>The bulk of Greer's book features seven laws, which may be better described as perspectives or lenses. The first three are foundational, the fourth is a bridge, and the last three are somewhat derived from the first. Many of these so-called laws overlap with one another. Law of Planes and Law of Evolution are highly interrelated. Why are there seven laws? For relatively unconvincing reasons resembling gematria. I found these "laws" unevenly resonant, with the Law of Cause and Effect quite uninspiring, but others much more evocative.</p>
<p>(The <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Seven_Fundamental_Laws_of_Spiritual_Ecology">Seven Fundamental Laws of Spiritual Ecology</a> are well documented, so rather than enumerating them I'll just focus on the ideas across the laws that I found compelling.)</p>
<p><strong>An alternative entry point to complex systems</strong> Greer's first three laws can be cleanly mapped to the canon of complexity science. Wholeness is all about the world consisting of complex adaptive systems. Flow is about stocks and flows. Finally, balance is about balancing feedback loops.</p>
<p><strong>Everything flows at different rates</strong>. Flow rates vary, often moving at a pace far slower or faster than humans are capable of perceiving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the boulder left by a glacier on one corner of the meadow during the last ice age fifteen thousand years ago is slowly being weathered away by rain, wind, and the slow action of lichens, and fifteen thousand years from now, it will be a fraction of its present size. Solid as it seems, the stone is also flowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps there is a general scaling law that the smaller, the faster, and the higher the frequency? (Also see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Small_animals_perceive_time_more_quickly">Small animals perceive time more quickly</a> and <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Smaller_objects_move_faster">Smaller objects move faster</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Accumulation is poison</strong> because it effectively stops the natural flow of things. My initial reaction to this was one of skepticism: some accumulations seem alright. Organisms need a store of energy to survive. Accumulation also afford freedom. Freedom to consider something other than just constant toil for the purpose of survival.</p>
<p>Greer seems less judgmental about accumulation in the human realm, especially when this is for the future of one’s own life. He explicitly rejects that material wealth is an evil thing and the only right path is one of abject poverty. Instead, in the spirit of seeking a middle way (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Middle_way_in_Buddhism">Middle way in Buddhism</a>), Greer suggests something that resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If material wealth is flowing into your life, material wealth in some form should be flowing out of it at an equal rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Goldilocks zones and balance</strong>: The opposite of thirst is not too much water, it’s just enough water. By default, people seek extremes and this intuition is often wrong. This section evoked a lot of related ideas for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Balancing_loops_are_goal_seeking">Balancing loops are goal seeking</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Active_stability_is_related_to_non-equilibrium_systems">Active stability is related to non-equilibrium systems</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Goldilocks_principle">Goldilocks principle</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Too_much_of_a_virtue_becomes_a_vice">Too much of a virtue becomes a vice</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Scale_causes_ossification">Scale causes ossification</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Two_Watersheds_-_too_much_institutionalization">Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/People_favor_addition_over_subtraction">People favor addition over subtraction</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principle of rebound</strong>: Intriguingly, Greer writes about a practical application of his Law of Balance. Deliberately push a balanced system one way, and you will make it swing back the other way with redoubled force. Fast so that you enjoy food more during the next days. This is a sort of synthesized delayed gratification. Related to <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Manufactured_suffering_for_resilience,_antifragility_and_happiness">Manufactured suffering for resilience, antifragility and happiness</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints are a source of power and elegance</strong>: Like the flow of water through a thinning tube, as the tube thins, the flow will become more and more powerful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power is born when a flow of energy encounters firm limits, and the more narrow the outlet left open by those limits, the greater the power will be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated with me, and reminded me of the benefit of constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Constraints_can_be_good_for_innovation">Constraints can be good for innovation</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Judaism_encourages_robust_debate_within_constraints">Judaism encourages robust debate within constraints</a></li>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Benefits_of_manufactured_childhood_rebellion">Benefits of manufactured childhood rebellion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I found that reframing beauty as "elegance" is generative, and fits well with Greer's example of bird flight, in which nature "engineered" or "designed" an elegant system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To achieve the power of flight, sparrows and most other birds accept strict and inflexible limits that prevent them from engaging in many activities that other living things can do. These limits are anything but arbitrary; rather, they are the other side of the power of flight itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every manifestation in the real world is limited. If you break through these limits, you don't thrive, you die.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a cell ignores the limits placed on it by the body as a whole system and instead grows in an unlimited way, doctors call that condition "cancer." Freed from all limits, the human body would not become something superhuman; it would simply turn into a puddle of red slush, powerless, ugly, and dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Overlapping planes of mind and body</strong>: Greer's notion of planes is very abstract: "Everything exists and functions on one of several planes of being." The most concrete and interesting planes are the mind and the body plane. These planes interact, but only in very specific ways.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem lifecycles</strong>: One intriguing idea in this chapter and the next was about the lifecycle of ecosystems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as every creature begins with a single cell and passes through its life cycle, every ecosystem begins with bare, nonliving elements and passes through stages, called "sers." Those stages reach from the first or pioneer sere that forms on bare ground right up to the final relatively stable sere, which ecologists call "the climax community."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Also see the excellent Wikipedia article on this topic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_community">Climax community</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seral_community">Seral community</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A seral community is an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Placeholders in ecosystems</strong>: I found powerful the idea that individuals in an ecosystem can be seen as placeholders. The organism may die, but its immediate life wasn't that important for the whole system. The individual was playing a role that many had played in the past, and many will play in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meadow in which the mouse and the grass thrive, in other words, is simply one phase of a greater process of change that began long before either one was born, and that meadow will continue long after both have died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, this role can be played by a variety of creatures that evolve, but are still fundamentally of the same lineage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten million years ago, some other species of small rodent filled the same role in meadow ecologies in the same region that the field house fills today, and ten million years from now, todays field mouse will likely be replaced by another species of rodent or some other creature not too different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Magic is about the mind</strong>: Greer has a very hard boiled, realist take on magic. It mainly operates on the “plane of the mind”, and affects other planes only insofar as they overlap to the mind one. He talks lucidly of real limits when it comes to what you can expect magic to be able to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Societal lifecycles</strong>: Greer compares societies to ecosystems and suggests that they too have lifecycle. But what are the seres, and what is the climax community for societies? Perhaps the notion of progress is less clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each human society arises out of the chaos left behind by some previous society and it takes shape in response to whatever challenge the old society couldn’t meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Turchin (<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Fathers-and-sons_cycles">Fathers-and-sons cycles</a>) as well as Tainter (<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Collapse_of_Complex_Societies_by_Joseph_Tainter">Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter</a>). But there is less of a clear sense of progress from one society to the next. This rhymes with the nonlinearity of moral progress (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Moral_progress_is_a_cycle,_technological_progress_is_an_arrow">Moral progress is a cycle, technological progress is an arrow</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unfortunately common for the people of one society to ignore the hard won wisdom of older societies and suffer as a result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Technological lifecycles?</strong> Greer goes further. He wouldn’t be surprised if at the end of our industrial society in several decades, many of today’s tech will become the stuff of legend. Atlantis, an advanced but lost civilization is a common trope in mystery schools. All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people of Atlantis ignored the laws of spiritual ecology and by the time those laws finished with them, nothing remained of Atlantis but gray waves rolling across empty ocean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dealing with higher ideals vs. disappointing realities</strong>: paraphrasing Greer, there are a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Settle for the world as it is, optimizing for pleasure and profit.</li>
<li>Turn to ordinary religion with the hope of a better world after death.</li>
<li>Join social movements or political activism to make the world a better place.</li>
<li>Convince yourselves that changing your own thinking will scale up.</li>
<li>Sit and wait for some apocalyptic event to make the world live up to our expectations.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet there is also another way: the way of the mysteries. This way starts by realizing that our everyday life in the world of manifestation, here and now, exactly as it is, is a lesson to be studied and understood, rather than a trap to be escaped or an illusion to be ignored. It goes on to recognize that the same laws that shape our ecological relationships with the world around us also define our existence in the subtler realms of mind and spirit and that learning to live and act in harmony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like Greer's call to curiosity, but it seems to me that the mystery schools are just one of many different ways to study and understand the lessons from daily life. Still, I'm pleasantly surprised how neatly Greer's ideas map onto my existing canon of Complexity-related notes. Also, it's useful to find giant gaps in my understanding of ecology (e.g. sers, climax communities, etc) will surely make for an illuminating follow-up.</p>

    <title>Technofeudalism by Yanis Varoufakis</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/technofeudalism-by-yanis-varoufakis"/>
    
    <updated>2024-03-01T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/technofeudalism-by-yanis-varoufakis</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Varoufakis' book is written as a missive to his late socialist father, as an attempt to answer his question “Now that computers speak to each other, will capitalism self-destruct or become unassailable?”. His answer is confidently that capitalism has already metastasized into something much worse, characterized by a highly centralized Big Tech sector which engages in rent seeking behavior. He sensationally calls this diagnosis Technofeudalism, and his remedies are unconvincing.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing demand post-WW2</strong>: Going beyond Zeihan (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_End_of_the_World_Is_Just_the_Beginning_by_Peter_Zeihan">The End of the World Is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan</a>), Varoufakis elaborates on how the WW2-era war machine was turned into a consumer-facing economy. He describes the period between WW2 and now as one in which the US established global hegemony. This soviet-esque centrally planned war economy was a great success. During the war, America's manufacturing machine grew so large that once the war was over and it switched to consumer goods, it would overflow the US market. As a result, there was a need to manufacture more demand domestically, and to create international demand for American goods. Thus in addition to robust advertisement at home, we needed America's exported global culture. (Lots of overlap with Adam Curtis' Century of the Self, and a reference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-HR88uPBU">Mad Men</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sacking the commons</strong>: Varoufakis claims that large paradigm shifts aren’t just technological but first social. For the internet age, he describes a politically sanctioned plunder of the internet commons. This was followed by the invention of page rank and other tech.</p>
<p>Provocative analogy of common protocols of internet 1.0 (IMAP, SMTP, HTTP) to the British forests. Both used to be public, but became increasingly privatized and exploited for its resources for personal and corporate gain.</p>
<p><strong>Incentivizing over-complication</strong>: Bankers are incentivized to make complex instruments that are not well understood by the public. Big tech employees are similarly incentivized to do the same, creating complex systems to dazzle promotion committees with their sheer ambition and scalability and level of abstraction. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Simplicity_is_underrated_at_Big_Tech">Simplicity is underrated at Big Tech</a></p>
<p><strong>Rents vs. profits</strong>: Varoufakis rails against rent seeking as something that is actively destructive in the tradition of Adam Smith. His argument is that when rental income dominates corporate profits, you end up with a sort of degenerative capitalism that he calls feudalism. But how is rent different than profit fundamentally?</p>
<ul>
<li>Profits is reduced by competition while rent is not. If my neighbor landlords raise rents, my rent also goes up.</li>
<li>Branding extracts not just profits but “brand rents”, which let them accrue value for “nothing”</li>
<li>(He doesn't mention this, but presumably we want to avoid monopolies too. In a monopoly you end up with only one winner taking the whole pie.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capitalism ➡ Technofeudalism</strong>: Varoufakis' main argument is that modern capitalism has changed over the last decades, and no longer resembles the capitalism of the early 20th century. In particular, he blames big tech's cloud computing sector for rent seeking behavior. He calls this shift "technofeudalism" but acknowledges that this is spin — a marketing term designed to evoke the gravity of the situation. He lists many examples of cloud rent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple and Play Store are lords, charging app developer as vassals a 30% tax.</li>
<li>Major cloud providers (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) charging for cloud APIs that enable all applications.</li>
<li>Amazon taking a fee for selling goods in their online marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Related: <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Building_on_a_platform_is_providing_free_R&D">Building on a platform is providing free R&amp;D</a></p>
<p><strong>The remedy</strong>: Varoufakis notes that historically, the economic left struggles with offering a socialist vision for what the future ought to be, and attempts to remedy it by providing one. His vision is extremely multifaceted and includes many huge ideas, many of which he devotes fewer than a paragraph to. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Democratic corporations: divide post tax profits into tranches: fixed costs, salaries, bonuses.</li>
<li>Mostly egalitarian: each employee owns exactly one share of their company.</li>
<li>Bonuses: determined by Eurovision style tokens, similar to peer bonuses at Google.</li>
<li>Everything will be run by the committees, at various levels. Very anarchist.</li>
<li>Sortition: random delegates are chosen to represent some committees (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Sortition_prevents_power_hungry_people_from_exerting_too_much_control">Sortition prevents power hungry people from exerting too much control</a>).</li>
<li>Land reform: land is constantly on auction. Varoufakis doesn't bother citing Henry George, but he is clearly taking a page from his book (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Georgism_is_a_constantly_running_auction_on_all_land">Georgism is a constantly running auction on all land</a>).</li>
<li>Workers of the world unite: a global alliance of consumers, unionized workers, etc should decide to strike against all Amazon warehouses at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like many radicals, Varoufakis suffers from the pathology of being unable to even propose a coherent desired state, let alone a path to getting there (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Strategy_!=_Goals_!=_Ambitions">Strategy != Goals != Ambitions</a>). He describes a very elaborate, broad ranging vision, and then posits that the many modifications he proposes will get us there. I'm highly skeptical that this would work, since each one of the bullet points above are big ideas on their own and would introduce dozens of second order effects. In tandem, these second order effects would only multiply, leading to some unfathomable future even a very small number of time-steps away.</p>
<p>Perhaps Varoufakis is well grounded on many of these interventions. He worked at Valve previously, which I think is the source of some of the ideas behind "democratic corporations", but the book ends abruptly without much detail into these actual policies. But it feels to me that going into actual policy was never his goal. "Technofeudalism" is a manifesto that describes meaty problems without seriously proposing adequate solutions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Random:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bessemer process first enable large scale steel production. This enabled a lot more things to be built out of steel, such as ship hulls, which up to the 1850s were necessarily built out of wood. More in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Diffusion_of_steel_technology">Diffusion of steel technology</a>.</li>
<li>Contra the author, Thomas Edison did not actually electrocute an elephant to spread it alternating current. That’s a common misconception and draft the narrative. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/List_of_my_own_misconceptions">List of my own misconceptions</a></li>
<li>A compelling point that crypto is just another vehicle for Wall Street now. It’ll especially clear now that BTC is part of the various retirement funds. Just another vehicle for readying existing power structures.</li>
<li>Two antagonistic "super cloud fiefs". Chinese and American. But I don’t think that the Chinese superfiefdom is open for business.</li>
<li>After US froze Russia central bank out of the global financial system, Varoufakis claims that it’s the first time this happened. Even during the Russia-Britain war in 1850 (Crimean war?) British and Russian bankers continued to collaborate. True?</li>

    <title>David: The Divided Heart by David Wolpe</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/david-the-divided-heart-by-david-wolpe"/>
    
    <updated>2024-02-23T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/david-the-divided-heart-by-david-wolpe</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read this book as respite from Samuel I and before tackling Samuel II. Wolpe's retelling of David's stories is lively, easy to read, and insightful. Most of this book summarizes David's story from various perspectives: as a young man, on the run from Saul, as a king, as a father, at the end of his journey, and as the progenitor of the Messiah. I found Wolpe's negative insights to be the most incisive.</p>
<p>Wolpe observes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conventional religion has a regrettable tendency to do surgery on the human soul, leaving only the exalted parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not so with David. In the words of Baruch Halpern, "David is the first human being in world literature". Wolpe's overall portrait of David is not super sympathetic. David's flaws, sins, and moral failings are so great that this sentiment from former Israeli president Shimon Peres seems like an understatement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not everything David did on land, or on roofs, appears to me to be Judaism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author of this book is my radar from a number of different directions, most surprisingly via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQzPhEbyZ5g">interview with Sadhguru</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The supernatural and the feminine</strong>: With the exception of Saul raising Samuel from the dead, there is not a single supernatural miracle in the entire story of David. Wolpe observes that when David needs a miracle, God finds a woman to enact it in an earthly manner. Is this like <a href="https://youtu.be/txqiwrbYGrs?si=9PPAGRrQ5006kbis&amp;t=15">real life</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Family strife</strong>: Wolpe writes resonantly that “for king or commoner, the pain in families dwarfs even the final, eschatological battle”. David's family is rather extreme, a wild caricature of the sorts of pedestrian problems most people experience in their life. In a modern reading, does one soften and interpret them as allegory?</p>
<ul>
<li>David commits both adultery and murder in one sordid chapter, sleeping with Bathsheva ("I saw her bathing on the roof") and sending her husband Uriah to die at the hands of the Ammonites.</li>
<li>Nathan's prophecy that David and Bathsheba's first child would die then comes true.</li>
<li>David's children reenact David's own rape-and-murder when Amnon rapes his half-sister Tamar. Tamar's brother Absalom then avenges this act by murdering Amnon. All three are David's children.</li>
<li>Absalom attempts to usurp the throne from David in his moment of weakness. David flees like he fled from his stepfather Saul. Eventually David tries to spare Absalom, but his general kills his son against his will.</li>
<li>David's parting words to his son and heir Solomon are ruthless: kill Joab (David's general), kill Shimei (a man from Saul's lineage), and dispatch of Adonijah (David's son). Solomon systematically executes his father's wishes and secures his succession.</li>
</ul>
<p>I must say, recalling David's story in detail really enhances my appreciation the much loved "Hallelujah":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But all I ever learned from love,
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wolpe argues that David is the cho­sen of God exact­ly because of his com­plex­i­ty, which strikes me as a very modern take. Would the authors of the Bible considered complexity a desirable quality? I suspect they would laud David for being a great warrior king. A gentler modern reading is far more damning. David was "a man after God’s own heart", at the cost of sordid and tragic personal and family affairs. A broken hallelujah.</p>

    <title>Every Life is on Fire by Jeremy England</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/every-life-is-on-fire-by-jeremy-england"/>
    
    <updated>2024-02-09T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/every-life-is-on-fire-by-jeremy-england</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I came across this peculiar book in a circuitous way. I listened to part of an interview in which a certain Beff Jesos spent an inordinate amount of time speculating about non-equilibrium systems and how they might relate to the genesis of life. He also casually name-dropped Jeremy England. On his lead, I read an article about some of recent research on life-like simulations that seem to spontaneously reach orderly states, and came across this book. Turns out England is not just a statistical physicist, but also an ordained rabbi, and that "Every Life is On Fire" is a strange amalgam of condensed matter theory and The Torah, which sounded right up my alley.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the book thought-provoking and worthwhile despite its unevenness, abrupt end, and overreliance on scripture. One obscure episode from Exodus in which God teaches Moses to turn his hand sickly white and revert it back to normal was given far too much weight, resulting in a contorted and unconvincing analogy. On the other hand, some Torah references illuminated the author's thought process, and at a meta-level, reminded me about the flexibility of human minds to synthesize across such seemingly disparate fields. Anyway here are some ideas that stood out to me:</p>
<p><strong>Escape velocity and state changes</strong>: An intuitive and new-to-me way of looking at changes in state. Consider a particle in its transition from liquid to gas (e.g. boiling water), we can apply the concept of escape velocity. This particle is like a rocket trying to escape the gravitational field of earth. In this analogy, the earth is made out of these rocket-particles, so as more of them leave, the earth's mass decreases, effectively reducing escape velocity. This bandwagon effect applies generally to state changes, explaining why we observe quick transitions rather than gradual ones.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of "first principles thinking"</strong>: Reductionism holds that you can understand system by just understanding its constituent parts. But a complex system is often greater than the sum of its parts, exhibiting emergent behavior, so reductive thinking is inherently limited. Emergence is the opposite of reductionism. Multiple different fields have evolved to study phenomena from different perspectives. Each field has their scope and level of abstraction, suited to best study the phenomenons in their scope.</p>
<p><strong>Life and life-likeness</strong>: Physics doesn't concern itself with defining life, but some life-like properties can be described in physical terms. For example, life tends to replicate itself, tends to require external energy and use it to repair itself. Considering some edge cases reveals how complex the barrier between life and not-life is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire can self-replicate by spreading through a dry forest</li>
<li>Ice can repair itself if you make a hole in it and wait for the water to freeze</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Active and passive stability</strong>: Consider the self repair of an ice sheet crushed by a stick and the self repair that happens when skin repairs a cut. These are very different processes; skin is capable of dynamic self-repair, but ice is passively self-repaired.</p>
<p>Life has a tendency to exist in states that require constant energy input just to remain alive; repair happens continuously in response to ongoing wear and tear. In the event of a cut, the same regular maintenance occurs but perhaps at an accelerated rate.</p>
<p>A frozen pond, in contrast, requires no continuous energy to remain frozen. The crystal structure of the ice is sufficiently stable that it can just continue to exist as long as the temperature doesn't increase. If the structure is disrupted, water under the ice will naturally return to the surface and spontaneously freeze because of the temperature of the surroundings, self-repairing spontaneously.</p>
<p>The downside of the frozen pond strategy is that ice's crystal structure is highly vulnerable to changes in the environment. When it gets warm, the crystal will reliably melt and turn into water. This is static stability.</p>
<p>A biological system, in contrast, typically has a broader operating range, and is more resilient to environmental variation. Life is complex and constantly requires external energy to survive, but it is far more resilient.</p>
<p><strong>Everything interesting flows</strong>: is it true that all interesting systems require a constant flow of inbound energy? Equilibrium is death. There is a cascade of systems in which energy flows from one system to the next, with each of the energy flows cyclical in nature. These sub-systems are not in equilibrium, but they are still in predictable flow states. (There's an amazing visualization to be made on this theme, along the lines of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">Powers of Ten</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Resonance and adaptation</strong>: Energy does not just come into a system in some random way. Instead, its flow and properties have a certain structure. For example, a singer can break a glass with her voice if her pitch matches the resonance frequency of the glass. The singer's voice can be represented as a spectrum of frequencies and powers. In this case, the singer modulates the frequency of the sound wave she emits until it matches that of the glass, and then cranks up the amplitude.</p>
<p>The singer's pitch is the source of energy for the singer-glass system. Unlike the singer-glass, most systems have a fixed source of energy, and entities in the system can adapt to it. In the singer-glass system, imagine an imaginary glass that changes size to match the resonance frequency of the singer's voice. Like the singer's voice, the sun's rays transmit electromagnetic energy in a particular spectrum of frequencies and powers. And like the glass, every living creature adapts to this structured energy to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Energy in the Goldilocks zone</strong>: If energy is not structured correctly or is overpowering, it can be destructive to a system. England makes an interesting Goldilocks zone argument (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Goldilocks_principle">Goldilocks principle</a>) inspired by the paradoxical story of Moses and the burning bush.</p>
<ul>
<li>A bush subject to no external driving force will die of neglect.</li>
<li>A bush subject to too chaotic an external driving force will die of immolation.</li>
<li>A bush needs to have structured external driving forces to thrive.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what inspired the name of the book. Every life is a bit on fire.</p>

    <title>End of the World by Peter Zeihan</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/end-of-the-world-by-peter-zeihan"/>
    
    <updated>2024-01-18T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/end-of-the-world-by-peter-zeihan</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Zeihan's book is an interesting exercise in scenario planning: what if America decides to step back from its role as policeman of the world? But this is not the framing that the author uses. Instead, the book is a high-confidence prediction about the future based on geopolitical and demographic trends. In short, America will step down as global hegemon, global trade will end, supply chains will be irreparably damaged, the world will turn multipolar, and everyone will starve to death, except the Americans who will be a-OK!</p>
<p>Zeihan is a consultant to large companies making important strategic decisions, so I guess high confidence comes with the territory. I would be surprised if Zeihan's world transpires fully, but he makes good "big history" points and the book was worthwhile if you can get past the bombastic vibes.</p>
<p>In general, Zeihan does a good job of going pretty deep into how the world works, and explaining things like I'm five. This is inevitably simplifying, as in his explanation of mediums of exchange, which ignore ledgers as an important part of the history (see <a href="/books/end-of-the-world-by-peter-zeihan/books/debt-the-first-5000-years/">Debt by David Graeber</a>). Nits aside, I really liked his concise chronicle of global mediums of exchange, all historically gold-backed currencies, all the way to the end of Bretton Woods, where the USD now floats freely, untethered to gold. There is a certain unevenness in the presentation however, for example I really disliked his convoluted explanation of inflation, disinflation, and deflation.</p>
<p>The book delves surprisingly deeply into many nitty-gritty side-spurs most of which I think serve to explain the complexity of the modern manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>Geographies of Success</strong>. At different stages of human civilization, different geographic features were desirable. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunter-gatherers geography of success: access to a variety of climactic zones, often best situated at the bases of mountains.</li>
<li>Farmer geography of success: access to water, but also insulated from other people by large deserts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selon Zeihan, during the globalized American Order, these geographies ceased to matter, since you could get anything shipped to you. But once The Order collapses, they will begin to matter again.</p>
<p><strong>The Order and globalization</strong>: After World War II, America was in a position to try to establish a Rome-like global empire. America weighed her options and decided that direct rule would be unsustainable. Instead, America wisely bought a period of peace by offering a militarily brokered economic order with prosperity for all. This meant an essentially global free trade network without any of the historical challenges and high costs. Previous trade networks had way more middle-men charging exuberant prices at every step of the way and way smaller shipping volumes. This ushered in an unprecedented peace dividend (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_peace_dividend_is_over">The peace dividend is over</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Collapse of The Order</strong>: When the Soviets emerged as a countervailing pole shortly after WW2, America's need to create a strong western alliance became even stronger. When the Soviet empire collapsed, and America "won" the Cold War, it lost its sense of urgency and direction. Zeihan claims that the order is over without much justification. It seems to be more of a mood affiliation (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_fallacy_of_mood_affiliation">The fallacy of mood affiliation</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The uneven spread of tech revolutions</strong>: the industrial revolution began in Britain, where it took decades to refine the key inventions: steam engines, looms, factories. Subsequent adoption in other countries like Germany proceeded much faster. Later entrants like China industrialized even faster.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic determinism</strong>: It's hard to refute demographics, which are definitely an underrated (by me) source of long-term future projection. Given a demographic pyramid of the current world, it's relatively easy to predict a future pyramid because of population dynamics. In general, the more affluent a country, the lower the birth rate. If you have few children today, you will likely have few children in twenty years, because fewer children today means fewer child-bearing adults.</p>
<p>One major flaw with demographic determinism is that there is more to the story than just age. For example, a large young population may be skilled or unskilled, and these scenarios will play out very differently.</p>
<p>Straightforward projection of demographics does not account for immigration. Countries like the US and Canada are based on an influx of people from the outside, and this remains a major advantage compared to many other countries, which have similarly low birth rates but no immigration.</p>
<p><strong>De-sourcing trend</strong>: Multinational companies set up factories in other countries, hiring the local population and selling them the goods. Japan does this globally with Toyota and other car companies. China does this with their auto industry in Russia, especially after the pandemic (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Russian_car_industry_after_War_on_Ukraine">Russian car industry after War on Ukraine</a>). The US does this all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>The Order is fragile</strong>. Zeihan points to a historical episode in the 1980s, where the Iraq-Iran war disrupted global trade because the insurance industry collapsed. This rhymes a lot with what's happening in the Red Sea and Yemen's Houthi trade route disruptions. Large container ships enable essentially free global shipping and a very complex supply chain for all things. Unfortunately they cannot be easily defended, and having military escorts for all of them would be very expensive. Zeihan calls them "floating buffets" for other countries to raid.</p>
<p><strong>Without The Order</strong>: Zeihan's predictions without American-backed global free trade are dire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the Eurozone, Southeast Asia does not have an independently curated peace treaty, and many countries still harbor great hatreds towards one another from past aggression and atrocities (eg. most hate Japan, many fear China).</li>
<li>Purely oil exporting countries which dominate the Middle East rely on everyone else for everything else.</li>
<li>These Persian Gulf countries also rely on external experts for building and maintaining their own oil infrastructure, including both extraction and transportation.</li>
<li>(Israel is half a world away, so if the American brokered global peace ends, it will be Israel against its genocidal Arab neighbors which outnumber it by orders of magnitude.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Split by hemisphere?</strong> Zeihan predicts a multipolar world that is for some reason split by hemispheres. The American hemisphere will do super well for many reasons. First, there is so much untapped resource potential in America. Mexico has the right demographics and US has the right expertise to replace a lot of global supply chains. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will suffer because of longstanding hatreds, relative lack of resources.</p>
<p>Pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominant professions over time: this would be an interesting statistic to track. One angle could be to investigate the capital investment going into each profession. Another could be just raw numbers. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Most_common_professions_over_history">Most common professions over history</a></li>
<li>Japanese finance culture and debt forgiveness: Zeihan mentions some Japan-specific historical precedent having to do with debt forgiveness.</li>
<li>Demographic pyramids in general seem really powerful and interesting tools. <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/population-pyramids-compared">https://www.visualcapitalist.com/population-pyramids-compared</a></li>
<li>3D printing could be a significant enabling technology if Zeihan's dire predictions come to pass and globalized world trade propped up by the American Order vanishes.</li>
<li>In a zero-sum world, people will be more likely to look for scapegoats even in America and we all know what that means...</li>
</ul>

    <title>Great Work Of Time by John Crowley</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/great-work-of-time-by-john-crowley"/>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Thanks to AK for the suggestion, I found this to be a more historical and literary take on a concept similar to <a href="/books/the-end-of-eternity-by-isaac-asimov/">End of Eternity by Isaac Asimov</a>. It's also a short novella, which I think is part of why a lot of the details feel like they are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>Crowley's secret cabal of time traveling elites, takes after Asimov's Allwhen Council of Eternals. Except is founded by Cecil Rhodes and called the Otherhood. Just like Asimov's Eternals seek to intervene in time by making Minimal Necessary Changes for the Maximal Desired Response, the Otherhood seeks “the smallest possible intrusion that would have the proper effect”.</p>
<p>But unlike the Allwhen Council interested in preventing societal collapse, the Otherhood are Tories whose main goal is to keep the British empire going for as long as possible. In one future explored by Crowley, the Otherhood succeeds in this, preventing the calamities of the 20th century. A glimpse into the far future, however, reveals a dark and bizarre world with Hominids, Angels, and "Draconics". (Connecting the dots, this is supposed to be a terrible turn of events, but its apparent awfulness doesn’t really come through in the prose. What’s bad about it?)</p>
<p>Crowley goes beyond Asimov in describing the geometry of the multiverse which time travelers ("orthogonists") can traverse. Time marches on inexorably:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The universe proceeds out of what has been and into what it will be, inexorably, unstoppably, at the rate of one second per second, one year per year, forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But as I understand it, any forward progress breeds a new universe that is literally orthogonal to the arrow of time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At right angles to its forward progress lie the past and the future. The future, that is to say, does not lie "ahead" of the present in the stream of time, but at a right angle to it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can never enter the same present twice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The past he had passed through on his way back was not 'behind' his present at all, but at a right angle to it; the future of that past, which he had to traverse in order to get back again, was not the same road, and 'back' was not where he got.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I think this is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a> that quantum mechanics applies everywhere and at all times and so describes the whole universe. In particular, there is no wave function collapse. Schrödinger's cat is both alive and dead, even before the box is opened, but the "alive" and "dead" cats are in different branches of the multiverse, both of which are equally real, but which do not interact with each other.)</p>
<p>But how does time travel work in such a world? Well, I guess one possibility is that in the next time step, you move into a world that is a lot like the one before. With the many-worlds interpretation, it's possible that anything happens. So there's a non-zero probability of having a time machine and using it to time travel to a world that looks just like 1893. There is also a non-zero probability that you will use a chicken to time travel to a magical rainbow under the surface of Jupiter's smallest monkey. The only difference between these two scenarios is their respective probabilities.</p>

    <title>Letters to my Palestinian Neighbor by Halevi</title>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/letters-to-my-palestinian-neighbor-by-halevi</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I discovered Yossi Klein Halevi following Hamas' massacre on Oct 7 on a podcast. Halevi's ability to combine a firmly pro-Israeli position with a gentle touch impressed me. This comes through in his book too, which I liked overall. I'll recommend it to left-leaning friends struggling to understand the situation.</p>
<h1>Interesting history</h1>
<p>Half of Israeli Jews descend from the Arab diaspora. (I did some additional research at <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Waves_of_Jewish_immigration_(aliyah)_into_Israel">Waves of Jewish immigration (aliyah) into Israel</a>). This is a pretty solid counter to the idea that Zionism is a European colonial project.</p>
<p>Hertzl's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Scheme">Uganda Scheme</a> was new to me, or I'd forgotten the idea completely. Was this omitted from the brave and valiant history of Israel in my Hebrew school?</p>
<p>The 1975 UN resolution that "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379">Zionism is a form of racism</a>" caused the hard Israeli right to harden. This "Zionism = racism" act was reverted in 1990 which increased Jewish and Israeli inclination to peace.</p>
<p><strong>Genocidal neighbors</strong>: On one hand, you want to befriend your neighbors and let them into your house. On the other, when a genocidal enemy says that they want to destroy you, you should believe them. This is the dilemma that Israel faces with many Palestinians in Gaza. They are both neighbors and committed to the destruction of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Arafat’s Johannesburg Speech</strong>: In 1994, Yasser Arafat gave a speech in which he admitted that he wasn't actually looking for peace with Israel at all just a temporary seize fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What they are saying is that [Jerusalem] is their capital. No, it is not their capital. It is our capital. It is the first shrine of the Islam and the Moslems</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Palestinian voice for peace?</strong>: It's completely unclear where the serious voices advocating for a two state solution are in the Palestinian media. Where are they in the Arab world? Where are they in the broader Muslim world? (They seem to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PalestinianVoiceforPeace/">exist</a>, but they are quiet.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No national movement has rejected as many offers to create a nation as the Palestinian national movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Yossi's remedy</h1>
<p><strong>Distinguish between country &amp; land</strong> Both the Israelis and the Palestinians make claims to the same land. But neither side can have full control over that land, so the only way the conflict can resolve peacefully is if there's some equilibrium in which the country of Israel is not the same as the land of Israel and the country of Palestine is not the same as the land of Palestine.</p>
<p><strong>Understand the imperfection</strong>: Both sides must understand the imperfection of this equilibrium. This is just a compromise that needs to be reached while also acknowledging that both sides have a maximalist tendency to acquire all the land. This must be resisted in a credible way.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual contraction</strong>: There is a mirroring here between the Palestinian right of return and the Israeli settlement movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palestinian right of return</strong>: Palestinians from Tel Aviv, Western Jerusalem, etc, want to return there. This is unprecedented — no other defeated nation would ever make such demands, and there's no way Israel would concede to them.</li>
<li><strong>Israeli settlers movement</strong>: Israelis that care about holy lands in Judea, Samaria, and in Arab cities like Hebron want to return there. This flies in the face of a two state solution and gives Palestinians proof that there is no credible partner for negotiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These maximalist claims need to be reneged in a mutual contraction. Israel contracts its settlements and Palestine contracts its refugee return demands.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry-pick the holy books</strong>: There is so much in the scriptures, it’s a matter of picking the right narrative for the right time.</p>
<p>For example, from a religious Jewish perspective, it’s easy to see the territories as a literal commandment to capture the land of Israel and make it belong to the country. But also there are commandments about leaving the land fallow every 7 years and a bicentennial jubilee in which all debts and ownership is forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>Find common ground</strong>: Despite the differences between Abraham and Ibrahim in the Torah and Quran respectively (e.g. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Abraham_vs._Ibrahim_in_the_story_of_Sodom">Abraham vs. Ibrahim in the story of Sodom</a>), there is a common ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abraham/Ibrahim smashed his father's idols.</li>
<li>Ibrahim/Abraham was buried jointly by his sons Isaac and Ishmael, progenitors of proto-Judaism and proto-Islam.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Religious surrender vs. intellectual inquiry</strong>: Both Judaism and Islam have traditions of religious surrender and intellectual inquiry:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Judaism</th>
<th>Islam</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Religious surrender</td>
<td>Binding of Isaac</td>
<td>Prayer mats</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intellectual inquiry</td>
<td>Study houses</td>
<td>Lost enlightenment</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now in the 3rd millennium, Judaism lacks religious surrender, while Islam lacks intellectual inquiry. Both could use some work.</p>
<p><strong>On The Holocaust</strong>: A common Arab take on the holocaust is: "it never happened, we're glad it did, and we're gonna do it again". Yossi describes a conciliatory trip to Auschwitz, undertaken by a mixed group of Israelis and Palestinians in which Arabs got to see the plight of the Jews due to the Nazis. (The people that need that trip the most are the people that would never go on such a trip.)</p>
<p>A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains as illusive as ever, and while no book will provide one, this one shed light on some historical details I did not know about. I hope that "Letters" might be even more illuminating to left leaning friends that feel less intrinsically connected to Israel than I do.</p>

    <title>Tales from the Ant World by E. O. Wilson</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/tales-from-the-ant-world-by-e-o-wilson"/>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/tales-from-the-ant-world-by-e-o-wilson</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>As a kid growing up in the Soviet Union, I remember eyeing a book called Пароль скрещенных антенн (literally "password of the crossed antennae") on my grandfather's bookshelf. It had a green leather home-made cover on it with just the title on it in block capital lettering. My grandfather bound it himself, as he did with many other books, from popular science books to books banned by the authorities. Grandma told me many stories about his obsession with books and bookbinding hobby which he took on after retirement. He would read everywhere: on the pot, at the dinner table, on the sofa. He always had a book on his person, which came in handy because Soviet life involved waiting in so many long queues, you could get a lot of reading done.</p>
<p>I still have the book, and it's on my to-read shelf, but for now, I opted for E. O. Wilson's most accessible take about ants to whet my appetite. "Tales from the Ant World" is a sort of popularization of his more famous "Ants", a Pulitzer prize winning textbook. This in itself is remarkable, but E. O. Wilson is also a pretty remarkable figure who I first learned about from his work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience#Edward_O._Wilson">consilience</a>. The writing in "Tales" is very personal, including many anecdotes from Wilson's life, and I think is geared to nudge younger readers towards myrmecology when they grow up. Perhaps less specifically, this book feels primed to maximize latent curiosity for budding scientists (it me?).</p>
<p>Overall it was well written and crazy interesting, a nice diversion from my usual topics. As it happens, I'm dealing with a minor ant infestation at home. There's something pleasantly escapist about peeling back a mundane aspect of our daily experience and discovering a whole world inside. It's equally real, but completely different.</p>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of useful ants (workers, soldiers, queens) are female.</li>
<li>Males are "little more than flying sperm missiles", who after their nuptial flight, die or are driven away by their sisters</li>
<li>Winged ant queens can be inseminated by multiple males and have provisions for storing male sperm for the duration of their whole lifetime, 10 to 15 years!</li>
<li>A single queen is usually the mother of all the other ants in that colony.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pheromones</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ants can "speak" with a limited vocabulary 10-20 chemical "words". For example, a scout can discover food and report it to her sisters via pheromones she leaves on the trail behind her.</li>
<li>Each ant colony has its own unique smell, allowing ants to differentiate members of their own colony from intruders.</li>
<li>Dead ants emit a certain pheromone, and when they do, their sisters bring them to the ant cemetery.<ul>
<li>Wilson experimented by dabbing living ants with that pheromone and sure enough if dabbed, these ants are also carried to the cemetery despite their protestation! No ants were harmed in this particular experiment though. Subjects eventually wash themselves of it and return to normal ant life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Violence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ants are the dominant carnivores in their weight class.</li>
<li>Many ants are cannibals, eating their dead and injured.</li>
<li>Some species of ants can enslave other species of ants, and this is most commonly done by raiding another colony and stealing the larvae. These then grow up in the slaver nest and become pheromonically synchronized with their captors.<ul>
<li>Wilson suggests this may be a good strategy of expanding worker ranks in a very difficult survival environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Super-organisms?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fire ants have a fascinating survival tactic for flooding. They cling onto one another and create a living raft to float an entire colony back to shore (check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2ZysgGAABw">this video</a>).<ul>
<li>More accurately, it is a partially living raft given that many of the lower layers of ants will die of asphyxiation for their sisters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leaf cutter ants are especially coherent and work as a single unit.<ul>
<li>At which point are a collection of individuals better understood as a Super-organism?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <title>The Burnout Society by Byung-Chul Han</title>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/the-burnout-society-by-byung-chul-han</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Some interesting ideas in this philosophical pamphlet, but they are atomized and not woven into a strong coherent argument. The book is not especially well written: rambling and repetitive and lacking structure. I'd recommend a shorter summary (hello, you're welcome) or listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm56nQ31kBk">Episode 188 of Philosophize This</a>, which is what turned me onto Byung-Chul Han in the first place.</p>
<h1>Modernity suffers from too much positivity</h1>
<p>Human societies operate like the immune system. Just like the immune system's goal is to determine which cells are part of the organism and which aren't, societies do the same at a higher level of organization. Societies historically are based on an identity. Some people are part of the in-group, and others are not.</p>
<p>If an immune system is not working properly, the organism becomes infected with disease. Similarly, as contemporary society shifts to be more inclusive, "otherness is being replaced with difference", and societies and individuals living in them lose their identity. Because of this shift, we live in a time that is "poor in negativity". And so, unlike the pathologies of yore that are borne from excess negativity, modernity suffers from too much positivity. I don't think Han takes this in a xenophobic direction, but I can definitely see the potential for this strain of thinking.</p>
<p>This rhymes a bit with toxic positivity, which errs too much on being outwardly positive, no matter how dire the circumstances. It also reminds me of modern censorship tactics (eg. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Flood_the_zone_with_shit">Flood the zone with shit</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The violence of positivity does not deprive, it saturates; it does not exclude, it exhausts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depression, ADHD, and burnout syndrome point to excess positivity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s society is no longer Foucault’s disciplinary world of hospitals, madhouses, prisons, barracks, and factories. It has long been replaced by another regime, namely a society of fitness studios, office towers, banks, airports, shopping malls, and genetic laboratories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People living in a society which glorifies the idea that nothing is impossible are likely to set unreasonable expectations for themselves. This leads to a downward spiral of disappointment, and ultimately depression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, its inhabitants are no longer “obedience-subjects” but “achievement-subjects.” They are entrepreneurs of themselves [...] Excess work and performance escalate into auto-exploitation. This is more efficient than allo-exploitation, for the feeling of freedom attends it. The exploiter is simultaneously the exploited. Perpetrator and victim can no longer be distinguished.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Against multitasking</h1>
<p>Han compares modernity's demands to multi-task with the state of nature, in which animals must divide its attention between many activities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is why animals are incapable of contemplative immersion: either they are eating or they are copulating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This state of being is incompatible with maintaining and creating culture, creative work, and mental health. Han criticizes Arendt's and Nietzsche's endorsement of the active life, instead favoring the contemplative life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culture presumes an environment in which deep attention is possible. Increasingly, such immersive reflection is being displaced by an entirely different form of attention: hyperattention. A rash change of focus between different tasks, sources of information, and processes characterizes this scattered mode of awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me a lot of a few books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/books/creativity-by-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/">Creativity — Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a></li>
<li><a href="/books/deep-work-by-cal-newport/">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a></li>
<li>And of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs">HYPER-REALITY</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Negative emotions can be good</h1>
<ul>
<li>Too much positivity weakens feelings such as dread and mourning, which are important parts of the human experience.</li>
<li>In Zen meditation, one attempts to free the mind of thoughts to "achieve the pure negativity of not-to".</li>
</ul>
<p>Even rage can be good. Han writes that part of the problem of too much positivity is that we are losing the capacity for rage. Surprisingly, he interprets rage in a positive light. Perhaps there is something lost a bit in translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rage is the capacity to interrupt a given state and make a new state begin. Today it is yielding more and more to offense or annoyance [Ärgernis], “having a beef,” which proves incapable of effecting decisive change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defined this way, my mind goes to rage-quitting a job, which is less negative than say, road rage or a raging rampage. Indeed, when you notice negative emotions arise, that can be a catalyst for change.</p>
<h1>Two types of tiredness</h1>
<p>Han suggests that there are two kinds of tiredness. I don’t want to be tired of you. I want to be tired with you.</p>
<ol>
<li>"I-tiredness" is the tiredness of an exhausted ego. As in, I'm tired of you, a separating an isolating kind of fatigue.</li>
<li>"We-tiredness" after <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/874779">Handke</a> is a collective deep tiredness which brings wonder back into the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Han describes the difference in his usual cryptic style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tiredness of exhaustion is the tiredness of positive potency. It makes one incapable of doing something. Tiredness that inspires is tiredness of negative potency, namely of not-to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Han, The Sabbath is a dedicated space-time for collective deep tiredness built into the Jewish week. This resonates with me and reminds me a lot of Heschel's ideas in <a href="/books/the-sabbath-by-heschel/">The Sabbath by Heschel</a>.</p>
<p>Han ties this I-tiredness to the war the achievement society individual wages on himself. He invokes a very short story by Kafka called Prometheus (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Kafka_parables_notes">Kafka parables notes</a>), in which “The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.” Han comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As everyone knows, Prometheus also brought work to mankind when he gave mortals the gift of fire. Today’s achievement-subject deems itself free when in fact it is bound like Prometheus. The eagle that consumes an ever-regrowing liver can be interpreted as the subject’s alter ego. Viewed in this way, the relation between Prometheus and the eagle represents a relation of self-exploitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Achievement society</h1>
<p>In a somewhat wayward way, Han brings us to the main thesis of the book, which is that modern society is no longer a negative disciplinary society (thou shalt not X), but rather a positive, achievement society (you can be anything you want to be). He rehashes the same point many times over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our society has eliminated the commanding Other in exchange for the self-starting entrepreneur.</li>
<li>The late-modern achievement-subject [...] liberates itself into a project. However, the change from subject to project does not make power or violence disappear. Auto-compulsion, which presents itself as freedom, takes the place of allo-compulsion.</li>
<li>Achievement society is the society of self-exploitation.</li>
<li>The achievement-subject exploits itself until it burns out.</li>
<li>The achievement-subject that understands itself as its own master, as homo liber, turns out to be homo sacer.</li>
<li>The achievement-subject is simultaneously perpetrator and victim, master and slave. Freedom and violence now coincide.</li>
<li>The project turns out to be a projectile that the achievement-subject is aiming at itself (haha — nice wordplay)</li>
</ul>
<p>Han suggests that depression is caused by becoming “exhausted by his sovereignty”, tired from the constant need for initiative.</p>
<p>Han dunks on Freud and declares psychoanalysis obsolete. If I was more versed in psychoanalysis I might be more capable of understanding convoluted phrases like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It proves quite easy to withdraw the weakened libido from the Other and to use it to cathect new objects. There is no need for drawn-out, pain-filled “dream work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My assessment from the first read is "great ideas poorly assembled". Maybe it flows better in the original German?</p>

    <title>This is How You Lose the Time War</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war"/>
    
    <updated>2023-10-05T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>A stylistically beautiful novella reminiscent of <a href="/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino/">Invisible cities by Italo Calvino</a>. Written in an innovative format, this is more poetry than prose. "Time War" was certainly worth my time, but I could see how it may be annoying to some. At least it is mercifully short!</p>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Well executed slow reveal (Burn Before Reading)<ul>
<li>Multiverse composed of multiple forking strands and threads. They have names and numbers. Going "upthread" means back in time, "downthread" into the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beautiful quips like:<ul>
<li>“adventure works in any strand. It calls to those who care more for living than for their lives”</li>
<li>"She climbs up thread and down. She braids and unbraids history’s hair"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ridiculously creative way of corresponding with one another. Letters are cleverly encoded in owl pellets (ha gross), seed sacks etc.</li>
<li>Maybe this is deliberate, but who The Seeker is remains unclear. Is it the other agent? Or is it something else, planted by capital-C Chaos?</li>
<li>If the world is a game, Blue and Red play a meta-game. But it feels like there is also a meta-meta game being played, which Blue and Red are only faintly aware of.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complaints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blue and Red are agents for two opposing "shifts", led by Garden and Commandant respectively, and representing broadly speaking Nature versus Technology.<ul>
<li>Maybe this is somehow the point, but the two narrators/voices of the letters were indistinguishable.</li>
</ul>

Killed Tsar and his ministers<br>
Anastasia screamed in vain<br></p>

        <p>My skip-skip-skip level manager at work recommended it to all of his manager reports, and so I decided to read this book to get closer to the top brass. Overall it was a sobering read, actively reminding me how far my organization is from being customer-centric. The book mostly addresses product managers, but tries to also apply to leaders in general, and "product people" in particular. It's a bit unclear who these people are, but I suspect they include product-minded engineers and designers.</p>
<p>Things I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coach-as-manager</strong>: Emphasis on coach-as-manager was interesting. "You can no longer be a good manager without being a good coach."</li>
<li><strong>Build Right Thing</strong>: The goal of a product manager is to ensure that the features being built by the product engineering team are the right features to be building.</li>
<li><strong>Product Discovery</strong>: The product development process is a process of discovery. It's like the product is already there, you just need to discover it, as opposed to inventing it from whole cloth.</li>
<li><strong>PM's fault</strong>: for a product to be successful, all cross-functional stakeholders have to have been successful. But if a product is not successful, it's the fault of the product manager.</li>
<li><strong>Platform vs. experience</strong>: Platform teams are not the same as experience teams and I strongly gravitate towards experience teams. The worst is when your experience team gets reorged to become a platform team.</li>
<li><strong>Against the agency model</strong>: The authors advocate strongly against the agency model, which encourages employees to behave like mercenaries rather than like missionaries.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy means focus</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Four big product risks</strong>: (<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Four_Big_Product_Risks">Four Big Product Risks</a>)<ol>
<li>Value: will they buy it?</li>
<li>Usability: will they figure out how to use it?</li>
<li>Feasibility: can we build it?</li>
<li>Business viability: will it work for the business?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I did not like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perpetuating Silicon Valley tropes:<ul>
<li>Bill Campbell cult (reminds me of CB)</li>
<li>Favorite essay is "Software is Eating the World". How trite!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unclear how lessons from this book apply to completely new products like Smart Glasses. How we be customer-centric in a world where we have no customers?</li>
<li>Authors seem overly optimistic about equity based compensation as a way to perfectly align incentives. At a company the size of Google, I don't think that sufficiently aligns individual actions. Might work better at a smaller company though!</li>

        <p>Mike Duncan covers a ton of ground on the events, people, and the necessary background to understand the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>I appreciated the time spent on pre-revolutionary Russian history, and ideas and learned a lot about Russian anarchism. In particular, <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Bakunin's_ideas_of_collectivist_anarchism_are_appealing">Bakunin's ideas of collectivist anarchism are appealing</a>, because <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Power_corrupts,_but_absolute_power_corrupts_absolutely">Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely</a>.</p>
<p>One may balk at <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Kremlinology,_Putinology,_and_now_Prigozhinology">Kremlinology, Putinology, and now Prigozhinology</a>, but understanding the main players deeply is important, especially when events are contingent and individual actions can determine the fate of whole countries. Here too, Duncan does a good job providing more personal color than a dry history lecture might.</p>
<p>Feel free to read my working notes, or <a href="https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/">listen to the podcast yourself</a>. What follows is an incomplete summary of themes I found novel and compelling.</p>
<!--more-->

<h1>A chain of embarrassing defeats lead up to the revolution</h1>
<ul>
<li>Defeat in the Crimean war (1850s), embarrassingly shows how backwards Russia was, supposedly a military powerhouse.</li>
<li>Defeat in Russo Japanese war (1905). Lost Port Arthur and the whole pacific fleet.</li>
<li>Poor performance in WW1, which found Russia "grossly unprepared" and with far worst logistics than Germany, infighting, and distracted by lofty goals like taking Constantinople.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Russia's Turkish ambitions</h3>
<p>That's right, Russia had an explicit goal of taking the city of Constantinople away from the Ottomans. That would give Russians both the second and the third Rome! This was incredibly ambitious and in retrospect unrealistic. Despite Russia's sub-par performance in the war, some Russian leaders in the provisional government attempted to keep the conquest of Constantinople as one of Russia's military goals. Even as late as February 1917!</p>
<h1>Jewish matters</h1>
<ul>
<li>Curious to see how important the Jewish Bund is to the whole revolution, both in the labor movement and Russian Revolution.</li>
<li>The reactionary forces set in motion by the 1905 Russian Revolution mostly targeted Jews. Jews were very closely associated with Bolsheviks because most of the Bolshevik leaders were Jews. The internationalist orientation of the Bolshevik party, only helped antisemites confirm that Jews were foreign agents. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were a Russian invention, first printed in 1903.</li>
<li>"Death to the Yids!" was as common as "Death to the Bolsheviks" during these times. This rhymes with the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Jewish_Bolshevism_conspiracy">Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy</a> used by Nazis to justify the Holocaust, which I first read about in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Bloodlands_by_Timothy_Snyder">Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder</a>.</li>
<li>Yet leaders of all colors, red, white, and black constantly distanced themselves from the pogroms on the ground. They would condemn antisemitism in words only, without ever actually doing anything to stop it.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Russia's early industrialization</h1>
<p>Sergei Witte successfully led Russian railway modernization in the late 19th century. He argued that the tsarist regime could only be saved by transforming Russia into a modern industrial society. Some of his rapid industrial reforms were very successful and showed that Russia was well on its way to industrialization. This played well into the Marxist narrative that a first revolution was necessary for the socialist one that was to follow.</p>
<h3>Russia's archaic farming system</h3>
<p>The "open-field system" was the prevalent agricultural system in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Large fields, usually several hundred acres each, were divided into many narrow strips of land and doled out to peasants. A lucky family might own several independent strips in different regions, which was very inefficient.</p>
<p>Because Russia freed the serfs only in the mid-19th century, this system remained in place far longer than in other European countries. And it wasn't until Stolypin's reforms in 1905 that the system began to slowly phase out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Medieval_farm_plots_were_long_and_thin_because_oxen_couldn't_turn">Medieval farm plots were long and thin because oxen couldn't turn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Western-backed industrialization</h3>
<p>After the revolution and during the 1920s, the Great Depression in the West reduced popular confidence in capitalism. Thus, western investors turned to the Soviet Union whose brave new economic model was not yet discredited. Its economy was shaky at the moment, but had a bright future ahead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Impressive growth rates during the first three five-year plans (1928–1940) are particularly notable given that this period is nearly congruent with the Great Depression. During this period, the Soviet Union saw rapid industrial growth while other regions were suffering from crisis. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41933723">The Soviet Problem with Two "Unknowns": How an American Architect and a Soviet Negotiator Jump-Started the Industrialization of Russia</a> was a worthwhile paper I read on this subject a few years ago.</p>
<h1>Russia was never democratic</h1>
<p>Wow, the color of the political climate between 1905 and 1917 makes me really reconsider the position that Russia had this period of democracy between 1905 and 1917. Something like 2000 people were murdered by the state as part of punitive actions conducted by the tsar following the revolution of 1905. The first Duma Congress was not real democracy, by any stretch of the imagination, and multiple Dumas were created and dismantled by the tsar.</p>
<p>So the actual precedent of liberals in power in Russian history is very small, possibly just Gorbachev and Yeltsin?</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Russia_has_never_been_liberal,_democratic,_or_free">Russia has never been liberal, democratic, or free</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>WW1: Europe's workers chose war over solidarity</h1>
<p>Fascinating (socialist) perspective: on the dawn of WW1, the workers were at a cross road between two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Join together for an international communist revolution, or</li>
<li>Kill each other at scale in the battlefield in the name of their respective nations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately they chose (2). Why? International socialists ultimately embraced their national identities rather than the globalist agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>By 1914 the socialist parties had been well integrated into the parliaments and could influence the government directly. They now had a lot to lose.</li>
<li>Being against the war meant that opposing parties could accuse the socialists of being unpatriotic.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Marx's prophecy of two revolutions</h1>
<p>Lenin and other Bolsheviks took Marx at his word, and thought Russia needed to undergo two revolutions. The first one to become more capitalist and industrialized to bring Russia into a state resembling the western society Marx imagined would be fertile ground for extreme inequality and worker immiseration. Then another socialist revolution would then actually bring forth socialism.</p>
<p>Luckily Russia was on track, and the Bolsheviks watched and waited in exile as the first revolution went swimmingly in 1905. Here are some proximate causes of the Revolution of 1905:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terrible performance in Russo Japanese war. Lost Port Arthur and the whole pacific fleet.</li>
<li>Worker strikes in at Petersburg and general support from workers and the Intelligentsia.</li>
<li>Bloody Sunday illustrated the tsar true colors and awarded him the nickname Bloody Nicholas.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Women began the February 1917 revolution</h1>
<p>In 1916, women spent forty hours a week in bread lines. And ultimately the radicalized women galvanized the February 1917 revolution during International Women's Day. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day#Early_development_in_the_USSR_and_other_communist_nations">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On March 8, 1917, in Petrograd (February 23, 1917, on the Julian calendar), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding "Bread and Peace"—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to czarism. This marked the beginning of the February Revolution, which alongside the October Revolution, made up the second Russian Revolution</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/There_are_only_nine_meals_between_mankind_and_anarchy">There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy</a>. Of course, there were also other causes for the February 1917 revolution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Millions of casualties in an entrenched war with front lines stabilizing but still a dismal situation.</li>
<li>Massive inflation due to funding the war effort leading to unaffordable living.</li>
<li>Lack of food and goods due to supply chain disruptions from prioritizing war efforts.</li>
<li>An unusually cold winter in 1917, leading to general misery.</li>
<li>A tsar that refused to do anything in response to a chorus of voices warning him of the dire path he is on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, International Women's Day was the catalyzing event.</p>
<h1>The hemophiliac grandmother of Europe</h1>
<p>Tsarevich Alexei, son of Nikolai II had hemophilia (non-clotting blood), a debilitating disease inherited from Queen Victoria I, known as the “grandmother of Europe” because of how many rulers were descended from her blood. Nicholas and Alexandra sought out a healer in hopes of curing their son and heir of Russia. And that is how Rasputin got an initial foothold in the Russian palace, coming recommended as a holy man and miracle healer.</p>
<p>Rasputin ended up being emblematic of the magical thinking so common in the last tsar's surroundings.</p>
<h1>Defeatism and defencism</h1>
<p>Defencists hoped Russia would win World War 1 outright. But there was also an internationalist (less charitably, defeatist) camp which hoped that Russia would lose. Lenin was more aligned with the latter, although his views are characterized as “flexible” despite bombastic delivery.</p>
<p>The Bolshevik membership dwindled during the war years because of their defeatist position. Because they wanted Russia to end the war and lose, they were easily painted as being extremely unpatriotic and equivalent to German agents. Lenin's flexibility allowed this to almost come true:</p>
<h3>Lenin's German-backed voyage from Switzerland to Petrograd</h3>
<p>The story of how Lenin got back from Switzerland to Russia on the eve of the February 1917 revolution is completely fascinating. The Germans learned that they may have a great asset in the revolutionary-in-exile, who at the time was living in Zurich. Lenin and a tight group of collaborators colluded with the Germans to orchestrate his return to St. Petersburg. They planned a clandestine operation, taking a circuitous route, and sneakily traveling in closed railway cars. The whole trip sounds like a great adventure. Surely there are books and movies written about it?</p>
<h1>Lenin's role and historical contingency</h1>
<p>During the "July Days", the revolutionaries themselves had to talk radicalized people down from pursuing a socialist revolution because they felt like they weren't quite ready for the events that might unfold. And if the provisional government managed to retain power after such an attempt, it would be bad news for future revolutionary prospects.</p>
<p>But Lenin was extremely passionate about decisive action, and managed to eventually convince the rest of the Bolsheviks. What would have happened without his drive, if the October Revolution did not play out?</p>
<p>Fanny Kaplan attempted to kill Lenin and almost did in 1919:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One bullet passed through Lenin's coat, and the other two struck him. One passed through his neck, punctured part of his left lung, and stopped near his right collarbone; the other lodged in his left shoulder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would have happened if she succeeded?</p>
<h1>Duma ➡ Soviets ➡ Communists</h1>
<p>After Nicholas' abdication, Russia was governed by "Dual Power". Under this scheme the country was ruled partly by the Provisional Government (Duma) and partly the people directly via bottom-up Soviets. The Soviet system emerged from the St. Petersburg Soviet and when they declared that they will be the Soviet of All of Russia, which eventually morphed into the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The slogan "All power to the Soviets" now makes more sense in this context of the parallel tracks of a provisional government and of soviets sharing power.</p>
<p>Lenin sensed that this dual power system was unstable and helped quash the provisional government. Then his Bolsheviks had a unified agenda and successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevization_of_the_Soviets">"bolshevized" the soviets</a>.</p>
<p>The Russian Communist Party is just a rebranding of the Bolshevik party and retains full continuity. The split between Communists and Socialists might mirror the differences of opinion between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Why is the political left so often infighting?</p>
<p>The new Communist government was recognized as by many of the international powers as part of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, hastily signed by the triumphant Communists after the October 1917 revolution on March 3, 1918. The treaty was terrible for the sovereignty of Russia because it lost so many territories. This was a serious gambit on the part of the Bolsheviks, an astounding move because of how much territory was ceded. But this did not last, as the treaty was annulled by the armistice of November 11, 1918.</p>
<h1>Absolute power corrupts absolutely</h1>
<p>Kerensky, leader of the provisional government in 1917 assumed more and more power until eventually he took up residence in the winter palace. Flags were raised when he was at home, as was the custom of the old order. He slept in the bed of the tsar. Kerensky believed he was the right leader for Russia. By September 1917 he had effectively cultivated a dictatorship. Didn’t last long though.</p>
<p>Kerensky lost touch and feared a counter revolution from the right. Through a series of miscommunication Kerensky became convinced that Kornilov was planning a right wing coup and empowered the Bolsheviks to defend the counter revolution (see
<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Defense_is_much_more_palatable_than_offense">Defense is much more palatable than offense</a>). This gave the Bolsheviks a second life, because at this point most were held in prison and convinced they were about to be executed.</p>
<p>It’s funny that the Soviets by 1919 had become quite corrupt and society was extremely unequal. Just as expected from a new elite that suddenly discovers an inordinate amount of power. This is interesting especially in contrast with the extremely austere and ideological stance of the communists just a year before.</p>
<p>Now this inequality meant that communist party began to attract careerists and those seeking comfort, a completely different group than ideologically driven revolutionaries. And the cycle is complete.</p>
<h1>Russians are a passive and nihilistic population</h1>
<p>Most Russians were neutral during the October Revolution. Few participated in the Bolshevik ideology, and few came to the defense of the provisional government.</p>
<p>This neutrality is deep-seated in the Russian soul. My theory is that this skeptical nihilistic stance stems from a lack of civic society. I strongly suspect that this lack of civil society is keeping Russia back politically, and that elites actively foment this stance in the population.</p>

<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Civil_society_is_an_antidote_to_autocracy">Civil society is an antidote to autocracy</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Reds, whites, blacks, and other colors</h1>
<p>Despite the reactionary white's military success in Ukraine, they were universally hated by the local population. The Cossack division of the white army served as mounted shock troopers, raiding Ukrainian cities to such an extent that they were completely distrusted. The communist reds were not much better, but committed fewer outright atrocities. The people chose them as the lesser of two evils.</p>
<h3>Lineage of the anarchist blacks</h3>
<p>Nestor Makhno was a Ukrainian anarchist and framed as an anti-anti-Semite by Duncan. Both of those these things are interesting, and I looked more into him as a person including a grotesque depiction in an old Soviet film, and read a few articles. Quite the character.</p>
<p>Makhno found under the black flag, the classic anarchist symbol. He temporarily allied with the communist Reds, but only to join forces against the Whites. After repelling the White forces, the Blacks and Reds did not have enough common ground. According to a prominent anarchist Peter Arshinov,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic psychological trait of Bolshevism is the realization of its will by means of the violent elimination of all other wills, the absolute destruction of all individuality, to the point where it becomes an inanimate object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such opinions were not tolerated by the Communists, and Makhno ultimately fled to Paris.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Bakunin's_ideas_of_collectivist_anarchism_are_appealing">Bakunin's ideas of collectivist anarchism are appealing</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other color armies</h3>
<p>The Polish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Army_(Poland)">Blue Army</a> was so named for French-issued blue military uniforms worn by the soldiers. There were also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_armies">Green Armies</a> during the same period of the Russian Civil War.</p>
<p>Using colors as names for armies feels especially out of place when millions of people are being displaced and dying.</p>
<h1>Russian chauvinism against Ukraine and visible minorities</h1>
<p>The Whites completely denied Ukraine's existence, instead calling it "Little Russia" (Малороссия). They completely ignored Ukrainian autonomy and national statehood, and appointed just ethnic Russians as governors for the region.</p>
<p>Before the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, propagandists used really disgusting overtly racist hatred of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>This xenophobia echoes Putin's ongoing war in Ukraine. Firstly, the dismissal of Ukrainian legitimacy is central to the whole endeavor. Secondly, visible minorities like the Buryats are much more likely to die in Ukraine because they are used as cannon fodder.</p>
<h1>Western-backed anti-Russian forces</h1>
<p>The White counter-revolution managed to make significant gains largely supported by the British.</p>
<p>There is a historical pattern emerging here from the perspective of Russia, or at least Russian propagandists. In the Russian Civil War, the Polish-Soviet War and the current Russo-Ukrainian war, allied western powers create a puppet entity, whether it's the White Army or the Polish State or the Ukrainian State, to wage war against Russia's historical integral territory. The Russians are of course on the defense in this framing, fighting for their survival. (See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Defense_is_much_more_palatable_than_offense">Defense is much more palatable than offense</a>)</p>
<p>In the civil war, people on the front were not motivated to fight for the idea of communism. Instead, the rallying cry in the civil war, in Soviet-Polish war and in general focused on preserving the integrity of Russia itself. The same was true during World War II, which was framed as the great patriotic war by Stalin to appeal not to ideology or way of life, but to the powerful force of Russian nationalism.</p>
<p>Why did Lloyd George change his mind on regime change in Russia? Initially he was extremely anti-Bolshevik, but it seems like he lost steam over time. In 1921, at the insistence of Great Britain, the Allies ended the Russian military intervention and gave up on the blockade. Are we on track for same change of heart in the Russian War on Ukraine now in 2023?</p>
<h1>Western relief for Russian famines</h1>
<p>During the terrible famines in the 1920s I didn't realize how much humanitarian aid the Soviets were receiving. Twice as many people would have died if not for the external help. The most impactful and generous was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Famine_Relief_Act">Russian Famine Relief Act</a> funded by the American Relief Administration (ARA), which gave $2B USD (2023) to the effort, until Lenin began to export grain in 1923.</p>
<h1>Lenin sowed the seeds for Stalin</h1>
<p>Lenin's cruelty is often overshadowed by his famously vile successor, but Stalin was largely building on top of the foundation that Lenin had set during his tenure.</p>
<p>Grossman makes a similar argument in (<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Все_Течёт_(Everything_Flows_by_Vasily_Grossman)">Все Течёт (Everything Flows by Vasily Grossman)</a>), saying that more than any of Lenin's other potential successors, Stalin best captured the essence of his soul: thirst for power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who, asks Grossman rhetorically, should be Lenin's successor? Would it be the brilliant, turbulent, magnificent Trostky? The charming, gifted political theorist Bukharin? Perhaps the one closest to the workers Rykov? Maybe the well-educated, confident, and sophisticated governor Kamenev? Last but not least, the one best versed in international labor, Zinovyev?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lenin and the Bolsheviks were flexible and not bound to morals</h3>
<p>One of the minor Bolsheviks named Bauman had an affair with another revolutionary, who became pregnant. Bauman responded by mocking her and circulating vicious cartoons. The woman later hanged herself. Most members of the party wanted Bauman expelled for this misconduct but not Lenin, citing that he was a good agent. Personal ethics was nothing to Lenin.</p>
<p>Early Bolsheviks would routinely participate in so-called expropriations. This was just a fancy term for stealing from the rich. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_Tiflis_bank_robbery">1907 Tiflis bank robbery</a> in particular was especially impressive and bloody, killing 40 and injuring 50. It was planned mainly by Stalin (aka Koba) and Ter-Petrosian (aka Kamo), but also involved Lenin.</p>
<p>Initially imagined as a multiparty system centered around the soviets, Left SRs were well represented alongside the Bolsheviks. Their presence gave the Bolsheviks plausible deniability to claim they weren’t authoritarian at all, and were just facilitating a democratic system. The left SR rebellion in 1918 changed that. They were opposed to Brest-Litovsk and wanted to usher in international communism. They were brutally repressed by Lenin in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_the_Socialist_Revolutionaries">Trial of the SRs</a>, which paved the way for Stalinist show trials in the era that followed.</p>
<p>I was surprised at how early the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_on_factions_in_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union">Soviet ban on Factions</a> began. Because it was rolled out in 1921, it's almost a foundational idea to the whole Soviet project. Fundamentally illiberal, it was effectively a ban on freedom of assembly and served to strengthen the Communist Party, by weakening the bottom-up soviets.</p>
<p>Lenin's own big personality is largely at fault for the Communist party's oligarchy, which tended towards autocracy. On the other hand, other Russia-specific trends point to something deeper. The tsars and the mongols that preceded presided over societies dominated by small cliques or individuals (Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great). Stalin and Lenin were just links in the same chain.</p>

        <p>What if a book review could be composed entirely of "what if?" questions?</p>
<p><strong>Speculative cephalopods</strong>: What if octopuses developed a communication system, exapted from their ability to create clouds to escape from predators? What if it was like visual speech, ephemeral as an ink cloud?</p>
<p><strong>Climate pressure as a catalyst for cephalopod intelligence</strong>: What if cephalopods experienced survival pressure from human induced climate change, which caused them to become extremely intelligent? What if it was analogous to early humans who were forced into resourceful survival by the coming of an ice age?</p>
<p><strong>Social learning</strong>: What if deep sea octopuses with a longer natural lifespan adapted to shallower depths and changed their breeding practices to overlap with their offspring, raising them and passing on their language and wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>Human machine labor</strong>: What if human labor ends up being cheaper than machine labor, and a wave of automation that once replaced human workers with robots runs in reverse because it turns out that a crew of human slaves is cheaper to maintain than a crew of marine robots?</p>
<p>(This reminds me of the low cost of human slave labor in Roman times. Why bother improving on simple water wheels if slaves are ubiquitous? <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Increasing_costs_of_human_labor_and_mechanization">Increasing costs of human labor and mechanization</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Tricking super-human intelligence:</strong> What if even in the far future, an advanced AI could be outwitted by a mere human to make a fatal mistake, just like Bing's ChatGPT could be outwitted to reveal its creepy secret identity, Sydney?</p>
<p><strong>Praying to super-human intelligence</strong>: What if the power imbalance between AIs and humans becomes so great that people will begin praying to AIs in the same way that a Christian might pray hoping The Lord hears her and grants her wish, except the AI can actually hear it and grant it?</p>
<p><strong>Musings on consciousness</strong>: What if "what is it like to be a Bat" is too hopelessly difficult to answer, and we should instead be focusing on "what is it like to be another person", which involves more empathy and theory-of-mind than most people can ever muster?</p>
<p><strong>Automonks</strong>: What if religious ceremonies could be performed by automata, and would that somehow diminish their effects on the deities that they are aimed to please?</p>
<p><strong>Contemplative robotics</strong>: What if zen-inspired contemplative Buddhist traditions could be harnessed to create biologically inspired, nature-compatible robots that are far superior to those descending from the higher modernist western tradition?</p>
<p><strong>Memory and forgetting</strong>: What if there was a conscious being that never forgets, and could it really have a human-like intelligence with perfect memory, while still retaining the ability to grow and change over time?</p>
<p><strong>Embodied cognition:</strong> What if most of an intelligent being's intelligence was located not in some centralized brain, but decentralized in its extremities, and what would the implications of that be?</p>
<p><strong>Underwater control</strong>: What if a human submerged underwater attached to a breathing apparatus could use their arms and legs to control more devices, like an army of semi-autonomous drones?</p>
<p><strong>Computerized therapy companions</strong>: What if a common prescription for loneliness and some mental health problems is to talk to a sophisticated virtual friend designed to be the perfect companion that discretely also administers a CBT program? What if this extends to virtual romantic partners? What if people delude themselves into thinking their virtual companions are real?</p>
<h2>Meta observations</h2>
<p>I am once again reminded that good speculative fiction is often a more powerful medium for conveying information than popular science (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Power_of_Fiction">Power of Fiction</a>).</p>
<p>The names of the characters were out of this world: Evrim, Rustem, Altantsetseg, Arnkatla Mínervudóttir-Chan. I enjoyed the somewhat exotic Central Asian settings where the events took place.</p>
<p>The quotes are at the start of the chapters are excepted from books authored by two main protagonists, <em>How Oceans Think</em> by Dr. Ha Hguyen, and <em>Building Minds</em> by Arnkatla Mínervudóttir-Chan. These quotes both contribute to character development and sprinkle in abstract wisdom. I really wish that "How Oceans Think" was a real book. I'd read it in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Although Nayler doesn't quite tie up all loose threads, the threads compliment one another in a way that I found pretty compelling.</p>
<h2>Synthesis with other mediums</h2>
<p>Nosferatu is apparently a reference to Dracula and the corresponding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6jFoYm3xs&amp;t=3051s">eponymous silent movie Nosferatu from 1922</a>.</p>
<p>The character Rustem's internet alias is Bakunin, a reference to the most famous Russian anarchist prominently featured in the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revolutions/id703889772">Russian Revolutions Podcast</a>. I'm digesting this magnum-podcast in parallel, review/summary forthcoming.</p>
<p>Nayler draws analogies between octopuses and fictional drone army operators (Altantsetseg) in their reliance on autonomous leaf-nodes, whether they are limbs or drones. Similarly, Sun Tzu and John Boyd <a href="/books/boyd-by-robert-coram/">recommend</a> giving subordinates loose orders but empowering with almost complete autonomy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.” – Frederik Pohl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By Pohl's metric, The Mountain in The Sea is great science fiction. I enjoyed the book thoroughly, major thanks to Captain A for the recommendation.</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I've heard a lot about Boyd in various FLUX-adjacent circles. His ideas seem to have reached a critical mass, in which they are widely known in the business world, having matriculated there from their origin in the military. I enjoyed this account of Boyd's larger than life legacy. Boyd is vividly depicted as a complex, brilliant, funny, and flawed character. He made great contributions to organizational dynamics, but was abrasive and broadly disliked. He was a great mentor to his followers, but an uncaring and absent father.</p>
<p>Boyd seemed to combine two incongruous personas. On one hand, he was a "big jock", a boastful fighter pilot who was constantly in your face. In retrospect, Top Gun does a good job of conveying some of this fighter pilot machismo. On the other, he was a history nerd, and read widely on war and philosophy.</p>
<p>There's a lot to digest in this book, and I've tried to categorize the things I've learned (TIL!) into a few categories:</p>
<h1>Organizational analogies to Google</h1>
<p><strong>Military performance reviews</strong> parallel my experience at Google. Except, their performance reviews are called ERs and peer reviews are called "indorsements". Similar to Google, positive indorsements from Generals (I guess L8+ Directors) are weighted heavily and are reason for promotion.</p>
<p>I was most interested in the author's insights on the dynamics of the military.</p>
<p>Boyd had an interesting pattern of ERs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As had happened again and again in Boyd’s career, his immediate supervisor gave him a poor or mediocre rating, one that signaled it was time to get out of the Air Force, and again and again a general officer rescued him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Politics between branches of the Military</strong>. Just like at Google, where different "orgs" are often less than friendly towards one another, the military has significant rivalries between branches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE Air Force has never made a serious study of warfare because every historically based effort to do so has come to the inescapable conclusion that the use of air power should be consistent with or—better yet— subordinate to the ground commander’s battle plans, a conclusion that argues against the existence of an independent Air Force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing galvanized an Air Force general more than being told the Navy was on his six.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyd's impact on the Air Force peaked with E-M theory, and his intellectual contributions did not really stick. They had a much warmer reception with the Army and especially with the Marine Corps, a warrior culture with utter contempt for the Air Force technocrats.</p>
<p><strong>Military briefs</strong> seem to be a very specific kind of medium. This is a fascinating digression in itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The briefer has a pointer, which he should not use too often. He stands on a stage but should not move about too much. He has a lectern upon which he should not lean. He has slides or charts but is expected to know the material far beyond what is displayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also interesting how some of the culture parallels some aspects of culture at Google, perhaps analogous to pitching a project to a director or senior PM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that most people can read and assimilate information faster than they can learn something by listening to a dog and pony show. But the U.S. military culture is an oral culture and the bedrock of that culture is the briefing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Franklin Roosevelt theory of management</strong>, bypassing sycophantic generals and seeking out from among relatively junior officers a few men who would tell him the truth. (See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Franklin_Roosevelt_theory_of_management">Franklin Roosevelt theory of management</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Corruption in the Pentagon</strong>. The real business of the Pentagon is buying weapons, which is a very idiosyncratic process. One big problem Spinney (one of Boyd's acolytes) identified was that defense contractors routinely underestimate costs so that Congress funds their programs. This is called front-loading.</p>
<p>Another issue has to do with the "revolving door" that shuffles former military officers into high-level jobs as defense contractors, just as the door pulls former hired guns into government careers.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders are opposed to free play</strong>. To hone skills around OODA, Boyd set up exercises which were "immensely popular with most junior officers and just as unpopular with most senior officers." because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free play means winners and losers; it means postexercise critiques by enlisted men as well as junior officers. No battalion commander enjoys being contradicted by a sergeant, especially if the sergeant is correct. And if a battalion commander loses a free-play exercise, he might lose his chance at promotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the problem with prediction markets (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Prediction_markets_do_not_align_with_what_leaders_want">Prediction markets do not align with what leaders want</a>).</p>
<h1>Fighter pilot culture</h1>
<p><strong>A shocking number of pilots died training at Nellis</strong>, training to be fighter pilots. Incoming F-86 students were told, “If you see the flag at full staff, take a picture.” Boyd says that in one year, more than seventy pilots were killed. A historian at Nellis says he probably was conservative—that wing commanders sometimes doctored statistics if too many pilots died.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a pilot augered in, screwed the pooch, fucked the duck, and bought the farm, then the base siren wailed and the blue car drove slowly and wives stood in the windows and the chaplain consoled and the flag hung at half staff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a temporary trend, and safety was becoming paramount in the Air Force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dogfighting was becoming an arcane and almost lost art in the Air Force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cool fighter pilot slang</strong>
- To "get on someone's six" is to be directly behind them.
- To "have someone in your pipper" means to be missile-locked onto another fighter plane.
- To "pull high G's" means to climb or bank abruptly, creating a lot of acceleration.
- "Guns. Guns. Guns." is what you say when you have someone in your pipper as if shooting them in a training exercise.
- A variable-geometry wing, commonly called the “swing wing.”</p>
<p><strong>Fast transients</strong> are fighter pilot maneuvers like "flat-plating the bird." and the "buttonhook turn" and "energy dumping" were strongly preferred by the Fighter Mafia, describing planes like the YF-16 that could perform them as "shit hot".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He would be in the defensive position with a challenger tight on his tail, both pulling heavy Gs, when he would suddenly pull the stick full aft, brace his elbows on either side of the cockpit, so the stick would not move laterally, and stomp the rudder. It was as if a manhole cover were sailing through the air and then suddenly flipped 90 degrees. The underside of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer became a speed brake that slowed the Hun from 400 knots to 150 knots in seconds. The pursuing pilot was thrown forward and now Boyd was on his tail radioing "Guns. Guns. Guns."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This "energy dumping" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_maneuver">Cobra maneuver</a> used to be prohibitively expensive, but became common for lightweight fighters.</p>
<p>More complicated maneuvers like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf1cRPs8CQo">button-hook turn</a> also became possible. Even crazier, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailslide">Kvochur's Bell</a> or "tail sliding" became possible.</p>
<p>TIL there's a whole diagramming language of aerial maneuvers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aresti_Catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Many fighter pilots are short</strong> to fit into a tight cockpit of the plane. Tom Cruise comes to mind... :)</p>
<p><strong>IDF Cameo</strong> involving Mordecai Hod, head of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), who reified the idea that aircraft guns make a lot of sense. In the Six Day War of June, the Israeli Air Force shot down sixty Arab jets while losing only ten fighters—an exchange ratio of six to one. Every Israeli kill was a gun kill. At the end of Hod's briefing,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a fighter pilot stood up and asked how the IAF got sixty gun kills. Hod paused, shrugged, and said, “Why waste a missile on an Arab?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fighters vs. bombers vs. test pilot culture</strong>. Bombers were in favor, with the military retooling for nuclear bombs because they believed that the next war would be nuclear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fighter pilots were the obsolete cowboys, but they had the fun job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SAC’s bomber pilots might be the glamour boys. But to a fighter pilot, flying a B-47 or a B-52 was the aviation equivalent of being a bus driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Test pilots were another breed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>detached from the airplane they flew. Fighter pilots fell in love with their airplane. Test pilots talked of going into space. Space? And in a capsule? You don’t fly a fucking capsule, you sit in it and watch the instruments. You’re a passenger. To hell with space. Fighter pilots wanted to get on an enemy’s six and hose the sonofabitch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Fighter pilot design</h1>
<p><strong>Energy–maneuverability theory</strong> is one of Boyd's first intellectual contributions. Fundamentally, it's a tool for fighter pilots to intuit the rate of change of energy available to the aircraft. For example, If I am at 30,000 feet and 450 knots and pull six Gs, how fast am I gaining or losing energy? Can my adversary gain or lose energy faster than I can?</p>
<p>The theory eventually became accepted in the Air Force and was instrumental in designing the F-16.</p>
<p><strong>Guns or missiles?</strong> The Air Force was inherently technology obsessed, and rushed to embrace any new technology. This led to over eager adoption of missiles before they could lock very well. It also led to fighter planes that were crippled by having too many features in them (feature creep!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Air Force was only seven years old, but it was fast becoming not only a bureaucracy, but a technocracy that worshiped equipment and gadgets more than any other branch of the military. It was becoming hardware oriented and the goals for its hardware were simple: Bigger-Faster-Higher-Farther.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, many generals mistakenly thought that "if an American pilot saw a blip on his radar, he pressed a button, launched a missile, and the blip disappeared. Poof! It was that simple.", but E-M data and computer simulations proved that reality was far different. And pilots knew it too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sparrow missiles performed so poorly they were considered little more than extra weight; more than one pilot punched them off his aircraft as soon as he was away from his home base.</p>
<p>Signs began showing up on the walls in the Pentagon: “It takes a fighter with a gun to kill a MiG-21.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Swing-wing were too heavy</strong> and did not justify the benefits that they purported to provide. A straight wing is most efficient for low-speed flight, but swept wings are superior for supersonic speeds. However, this design became obsolete by the 1970s, and Boyd foresaw it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the summer of 1967, the Soviets introduced two new fighters: the swing-wing MiG-23 and the MiG-25. American fighter pilots laughed at the MiG-23 and said the only good thing about the F-111 was that the Soviets had copied it and thereby lost at least one generation of aircraft to bad technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>F-111 design had too many miracles</strong></p>
<p>When Boyd was coming up in his career, he predicted that the F-111 would be a failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prudent designers usually make significant technological advances in only one of the three categories when they plan a new aircraft. But the F-111 was a high-tech wonder with two bold innovations, both of which were later to cause enormous problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyd knew that, left to its own devices, the bureaucracy always came up with an aircraft such as the F-111.</p>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Startups_should_have_exactly_one_miracle">Startups should have exactly one miracle</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, Boyd was proven right when the disastrous results of Vietnam became well known. During the Korean War, the US boasted a 10-to-1 kill ratio, but in Vietnam, the ratio sank close to parity, at one point favoring the North Vietnamese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the war finally ended, one Air Force pilot would be an ace. North Vietnam would have sixteen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>F-X was designed with maneuvering specifications</strong>, the first plane in the US Air Force designed with dogfighting in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The closest Boyd came to defining a specific technical solution was when he said the aircraft should pull enough Gs at 30,000 feet to “roll down your goddamn socks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Design by committee sucks</strong>. The design process of all projects Boyd was involved in was a huge struggle since it was designed by committee, and the plane became a huge kitchen sink.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Boyd worked daily to remove things from the F-X, seemingly everyone else in the Air Force—the fire-control people, missile people, electronic-warfare people—wanted to add something. Maintenance people even insisted the aircraft carry a built-in maintenance ladder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, Boyd lost many design battles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Air Force insisted on a speed greater than Mach 2. The Air Force insisted on a radar with a thirty-six-inch dome—a requirement that dictated a much larger fuselage than Boyd wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scope creep is a massive problem for products at Google too. Boyd was part of a ragtag team that tried to develop an alternative prototype:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night after night they labored at the Pentagon, drawing plans for an airplane they called the “Red Bird,” a 33,000-pound stripped-down version of the F-X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it was never brought into production, since</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all the three-stars who worked for [the Chief of Staff] wanted the bigger and heavier version of the F-X</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which was a huge blow to Boyd's ego:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had cut some weight, and yes, he had killed the variable-sweep wing. But it had taken just about everything out of him to fight and fight and fight for so much that was so obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this disempowerment is just a feature of working for a large bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p><strong>Tropospheric discontinuity</strong> is an interesting phenomenon (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause">wikipedia</a>), explaining why it is meaningful to talk about discrete parts of the atmosphere. The speed of sound at sea level is ~340 m/s, and decreases as the temperature decreases until reaching ~10 km altitude, where it drops to 300 m/s. This part of the atmosphere is called the tropopause, the boundary that marks the troposphere from the stratosphere. Higher than that, temperature and the speed of sound decrease at a much slower rate than in the troposphere.</p>
<h1>Boyd the person</h1>
<p>Coram spends quite a bit of time pontificating on Boyd's personal life, which was often in a state of disrepair.</p>
<p><strong>Boyd sayings</strong>
- “Stroking the bishop. You’re just stroking the bishop.”
- “I have found the dripping cock.” Secretaries wept at Boyd’s language. (Instead of "smoking gun")
- It is said that Air Force careerists—“Blue Suiters”—would put on track shoes and climb up the backs of their mothers for [appealing] assignments.
- “It’s too goddamn big, too goddamn expensive, too goddamn underpowered. It’s just not worth a good goddamn.”
- “We don’t care what the Russians are doing. We only care about what the Navy is doing.”
- Boyd asked “How did you get this data on the wing design?” The vice president charged off the cliff. “Wind-tunnel tests,” he said. “Fuck a wind tunnel,” Boyd roared. He pointed up. “The biggest wind tunnel in the world is up there. It’s called reality. This is not reality.”
- “Goddamn airplane is made out of balonium.”
- Boyd's “air-to-rug maneuver,” happened once, where his phone call with a Blue Suiter caused him to fall out of his chair.
- “If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty.”
- “There are only so many ulcers in the world and it is your job to see that other people get them.”
- “Machines don’t fight wars, people do, and they use their minds.”
- “People, ideas, hardware—in that order.”
- “They still believe in high diddle diddle, straight up the middle.”
- “So you got your reward; you got kicked in the teeth. That means you were doing good work. Getting kicked in the teeth is the reward for good work.”</p>
<p><strong>Boyd's "Acolytes"</strong> all subscribed to the "do something" idea, were not career oriented. They were "extraordinarily bright, all have an almost messianic desire to make a contribution to the world in which they live, all are men of probity and rectitude, and all—while independent in the extreme"</p>
<p>Many of these people were long-term collaborators from all over the military. Notably Thomas Christie, Pierre Sprey, Everest Riccioni, and others also formed a controversial ad-hoc group jokingly called the <strong>Fighter Mafia</strong> (a rejoinder to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Mafia">Bomber Mafia</a>) and strongly advocated for a lightweight fighter pilot.</p>
<p>Christie the Finagler, Sprey the Intelligent, Leopold the First, Spinney the Brash, and Burton the Unbending.</p>
<p><strong>Boyd the Legend</strong> Separating legend from truth was an ongoing challenge for me while reading the book, especially considering that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deep in the bone marrow of a fighter pilot—exaggeration and the belief that a good story is more important than sticking with the bare facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Incapable of compromise</strong>. The author speculates that had Boyd been promoted, he would have been a terrible general because of his inability to compromise, and lack of patience for those that disagreed with him. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Compromise_is_often_a_strength_for_Very_Senior_Leadership">Compromise is often a strength for Very Senior Leadership</a></p>
<p><strong>Extreme frugality</strong>. Boyd's Stoic approach to life led him astray. He thought that if</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if a man can reduce his needs to zero, he is truly free: there is nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to hurt him (если у вас нену тети...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He refused to ever purchase a home to raise his five children, and they despised him for it. He was so cheap that he carried his glasses in an old sock.</p>
<h1>Big Ideas</h1>
<p><strong>To Be or To Do</strong> refers to a famous speech delivered by Boyd, which came out of his realization that he would never make general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But hard work and success do not always go together in the military, where success is defined by rank, and reaching higher rank requires conforming to the military’s value system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyd made powerful enemies due to his outspoken nature, his lack of reluctance to criticize his superiors, and his love of conflict with others.</p>
<p>Study after study shows that the higher in rank a military officer ascends, the less likely he is to make change.</p>
<p>Boyd's speech summarized succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference.” He paused and stared into Leopold’s eyes and heart. “To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How to comply without really complying</strong>, Boyd was a master of this, for example when a general gave him a direct order to write a paper Boyd disagreed with, he complied, but then wrote a follow-up paper explaining in detail why he disagreed with his own paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he told the general he considered the two papers a package; if the first one were released, he would release the second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyd did not succeed in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Disagree_without_being_disagreeable">Disagree without being disagreeable</a>, but still an interesting path.</p>
<p><strong>Snowmobiling</strong>, John Boyd’s term, is how creativity really happens. It is destructive deduction combined with creative synthesis. Boyd used a thought experiment to show how destruction and creation lead to creativity. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">Schumpeter's gale</a>, Boyd emphasized creative synthesis. (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Snowmobiling_-_creativity_is_deduction_followed_by_synthesis">Snowmobiling - creativity is deduction followed by synthesis</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Sun Tzu &gt; von Clausewitz</strong>. Here I am really unmoored, not having read von Clausewitz. Boyd was opposed to a WWI-era idea of bringing the enemy to a gigantic decisive battle, instead favoring Sun Tzu's approach of unraveling the enemy before the battle occurs, perhaps avoiding the battle entirely!</p>
<ul>
<li>Von Clausewitz believes wars are decided by set piece battles more than by strategy, deception, and guerrilla-like tactics. This means that even if he wins, there is a bloodbath.</li>
<li>Sun Tzu believes in generating confusion, disorder, panic, and chaos. It's analogous to clipping the nerves, muscles, and tendons of an enemy, thus reducing him to jelly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observe-Orient-Decide-Act</strong>. Boyd is probably most famous for formulating the OODA loop, the process by which military strategists make decisions. By understanding it, one can develop an understanding of how to unravel one's enemy (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/OODA_Loops">OODA Loops</a>).</p>
<p>A key idea is that speed is of the essence. A successful commander must operate at a faster OODA Loop than does his opponent. This is why Boyd was so opposed to the idea of synchronization. This evening up the front line meant an army moves at the speed of its slowest unit.</p>
<p>One must truly understand how the enemy thinks to get under their skin (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Theory_of_Mind_and_unpredictability">Theory of Mind and unpredictability</a>). Boyd's rejoinder to the machine-obsessed Air Force mindset was that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Machines don’t fight wars,” he responded. “Terrain doesn’t fight wars. Humans fight wars. You must get into the minds of humans. That’s where the battles are won.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this human-centricity, and it's what got me into HCI in the first place. Without a good interface, the best software is garbage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next
- Watch El Cid, one of Boyd's favorite movies
- Is there some high level overview of military history? I feel a large gap, and Coram has done some good name-dropping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But some had never heard of Sun Tzu and could not spell “von Clausewitz.” They might have known the names of Douhet or Jomini or von Schlieffen or Fuller or Guderian or Lawrence or Balck, but few knew the theories espoused by these men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I know none of these men)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He told them of Sun Tzu and the Battle of Leuctra in 371 B.C. and of Arbela in 331 B.C. and of Cannae in 216 B.C. He told them of Genghis Khan and Belisarius and Napoléon, of Heinz Guderian and of what made great commanders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I know few of these battles)</p>
<ul>
<li>Look into General Patton because this quote is amazing. Perhaps time to watch "Patton".</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A simplistic explanation of cheng and ch’i comes from General George Patton, who in World War II said his plan for attacking the Germans was to “hold them by the ~~nose~~ balls and kick them in the ass.” Holding them by the nose is the cheng. Kicking them in the ass is the ch’i.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Probably worth reading Thomas Cleary's translation of Art of War. Lots of interesting aikido style ideas: "swordlessness", etc.</li>
<li>What’s the story with Dick Cheney? In my mind he is forever tainted by the Iraq war, but honestly don't know much beyond that. He seems to have been quite respected in Boyd's acolyte circles.</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://mca-marines.org/magazines/marine-corps-gazette/">Marine Corps Gazette</a>, which published a translation of Mao on guerrilla warfare in 1941, wrote extensively about Sun Tzu.</li>
<li>Maybe read "Certain to Win: The Strategy of John Boyd, Applied to Business" for a more pre-digested take.</li>
<li>Maybe watch "Legends of the Fall", a movie that seems to have affected Boyd emotionally (a rare thing).</li>
</ul>

        <p>One of my early childhood fixations was the golden peacock clock in the Hermitage in Leningrad. Now, here is a whole book about ancient automata, combining my interests in Medieval history and AI! I listened to the audio version, which perhaps impoverished my experience of "reading", assuming the non-audio book includes the beautiful paintings, illustrations, and diagrams described in prose.</p>
<p>This was an academic and dry read overall. I liked the overall arc of the work, but often found the author getting a bit lost in the details. The book initially focuses on automata of antiquity and the Islamic world, a fascinating and unusual lens on already fascinating civilizations. The medieval European reaction to these suspicious contraptions, and how they inspired fictional accounts of automata in European culture follows, until the narrative is capped with later medieval European automata and clocks in particular. Overall a cogent narrative, but some sections feel unnecessary, especially the disturbing chapter 4.</p>
<p>We begin in early Greece, where work on automata was chronicled by Hiro of Alexandria, who built various steam based contraptions. The Antikythera mechanism was only recently uncovered, a complex, dynamic stellar map operated by hand crank dating back to 80 BCE. These works along with much of the rest of the Greek tradition were unknown to the medieval Europeans but preserved via the Arabic world (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Lost_Enlightenment_by_Frederick_Starr">Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr</a>). During the Islamic enlightenment, many such contraptions were built. Al-Khwarizmi and many other famous Islamic scholars had a role to play in the automata creation too.</p>
<h1>Islamic automata</h1>
<p>Europeans were first exposed to automata from the Abbasids and Byzantines via gifts. It wasn’t until Harun al-Rashid gifted Charlemagne a mechanical water fountain that the west renewed their interest in automata. Fictional and legendary automata began appearing in chivalric romances. The vast majority of early and high middle age writings on the topic were unsurprisingly in French (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Old_French_was_spoken_across_a_lot_of_Europe,_hence_Lingua_Franca">Old French was spoken across a lot of Europe, hence Lingua Franca</a>).</p>
<p>Most automata from this period do not exist, so all we have are writings of dubious reliability. For example, The Throne of Solomon, a Byzantine automaton was described by a Carolingian writer, who emphasized lions that roared and birds that chirped, as well as a mysteriously rising throne. Reminds me of Baron Vladimir Harkonen from Dune (<a href="https://youtu.be/mWq15lDh8yM?t=91">Lynch</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/WQCV8O3oIU8?t=105">Villeneuve</a>). The Carolingian work offered some, but surprisingly little speculation about how the Throne of Solomon worked. Perhaps a rising wine press mechanism? The sounds were likely pipe organ-like pneumatic devices, but the author did not speculate about this aspect at all.</p>
<p>Another famous automaton was the Elephant clock (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_al-Jazari">Ismail al-Jazari</a>'s Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices), a Clepsydra, or water clock with ornate design and automaton functionality. It was far superior to that found in Charlemagne’s court. The technology and craftsmanship was next level. The cost to make it as well as the precision of the timepiece is far beyond candle clocks and sundials that the Frankish contemporaries were using at the time.</p>
<h1>Fictional automata in Europe</h1>
<p>Chanson de Geste (Chivalric Romances in English) often featured a binary contrast between eastern cleverness and western faith. This is described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_P%C3%A8lerinage_de_Charlemagne">Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne</a>, a story about Charlemagne’s visit to the fictional Byzantine Emperor Hugo. In the narrative, Hugo is depicted as being superior in riches, technology and cleverness. But God stands by the side of the western Roman emperor, as Charlemagne's faith prevailed over Hugo's dubious Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>One vignette from the Benoit's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Troie">Roman de Troie</a>, a Chivalric Epic about the Trojan War, stood out. In it, four golden automata in the Chambre de Beaute do various tasks around social control. One holds a mirror that helps you be presentable. The last is a robot that gives everyone perfect personalized social cues so that nobody loses face.</p>
<p>Another fictional automata described a contraption resembling a bronze knight with a spear, which whenever a Roman province threatened revolt, would point in its geographical direction. This magic is attributed to Virgil (what). Also, archers and buglers were often to be fictional automata that safeguarded cities from natural disaster or from barbarians. In one account, Naples had such guardians to warn its population about Vesuvius.</p>
<p>An automaton is not the same as a wine press. Because automata fall into the category of natura artifex and is more than just craftsmanship. There’s a god like element to that endeavor. Medieval Europeans would sometimes attribute the almost supernatural technology that they saw from the east to their superior civilization. But in other cases these automata would be attributed more to demonic means; sometimes to necromancy, sometimes to just being extremely vicious and vile. This helped confirm European superstitions. See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Natura_artifex_—_God,_nature,_and_humanity">Natura artifex — God, nature, and humanity</a>.</p>
<p>I really struggled through Chapter 4, "The Quick and the Dead" and nearly dropped the book. It features detailed and disgusting descriptions of a fictional automaton designed to preserve Hector of Troy's body by running alcoholic liquid through his embalmed corpse. Far too many details about balm, balsam, and other preservation techniques were both disgusting and overly detailed.</p>
<h1>European late medieval automata</h1>
<p>Chapter 5 returns back to the core theme of the book, this time describing real automata from the late European Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The automata described in the chivalric romances purport to do advanced things like maintaining the social milieu of a royal court and other fantastical things still far beyond modernity's ability.</p>
<p>In contrast, real automata of the late Middle Ages were quite simple. The court of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain">Phillip II</a>, for example, featured a room full of automata which embodied practical jokes, focusing mainly on surprising guests and making ladies clothes wet from above and, as emphasized in the chronicles, from below. These childish pranks mainly provided an endless source of entertainment for the royal class, but also served a more sinister function, separating those "in the know" from the outsiders.</p>
<p>The makers and maintainers of these automata in the 14th and 15th centuries tended to be painters. Painters of that era were highly respected, and typically oversaw groups of artisans to create the giant masterworks that they ended up creating.</p>
<p>Fascinating that the etymology of the word engine is from in engineer, or I guess in genius and genius, and it's just engineering. Is it also the same route where it's all about this ingenuity and genius</p>
<p>The escapement mechanism is almost a millennium old. A really great description of how it works can be found in <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/#escapement">this masterpiece</a> explaining how mechanical watches work.</p>
<h2>Clocks</h2>
<p>Strasbourg Horloge is a really famous and elaborate Clark in Strasbourg. Inspired Robert Boyle Renee to cards and tons of others that took a mechanistic view of the human condition. Including Thomas Hobbes.</p>
<p>The Latin word for bell is "clocca", which is the etymology of the word clock. So clocks and timekeeping have always been associated with more than just the abstract notion of time, but also some kind of action. And thus they are intimately linked to automata.</p>

        <p>A recommendation from MP, this is apparently one of the classics of the genre of Military Science Fiction. In addition to being a fun and quick read, I found it thought-provoking, and a really cool concept.</p>
<p>In a near-future earth, humans have traveled to other planets and made contact with aliens. As it turns out, our galaxy is teeming with intelligent, multi-planetary species far more advanced than us. And they're aggressive! To protect earth and its colonies against this thread, the humans have created the Colonial Defense Force (CDF). This galactic army is shrouded in mystery to the earth dwelling humans, which are bound to the planet. The only way for a human to leave earth is to take a leap of faith and sign your future septuagenarian self to fight for the CDF. And you can never go home again.</p>
<p>The book is not really profound, but skims some deeper than expected themes and references, including Arendt's banality of evil. This surpassed my expectations given the genre.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reincarnation: what happens when an army division consists entirely of octogenarians?</li>
<li>Nature vs nurture (ghost brigades): what would it be like to be a completely different person with roughly the same set of genes?</li>
<li>What is it like to love a person deeply, lose them, and then meet their clone?</li>
<li>What is it like to gain a completely new body after living a full and long life?</li>
<li>What would it be like to be battling a huge variety of unknown species all the time, where you have absolutely no idea what to expect?</li>
</ul>
<p>Choice quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with aging is not that it’s one damn thing after another—it’s every damn thing, all at once, all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun tech mockery, like naming a personal assistant "asshole" and the resulting potty humor including “Activate Asshole” and "Go away Asshole", as well as the assistant confirming that "I am Asshole". And other crass hilarity like a female soldier activating her assistant with "Hey Bitch".</p>
<p>I enjoyed the world building quite a bit, from the whole premise of the book, to the various alien species encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Consu, vaguely culturally Japanese, are a very advanced and enlightened species capable of destroying the humans easily, but interested in more profound goals. Honor and tradition seems to play a huge role in their culture, as is ritual honor based suicide clearly modeled after harakiri.</li>
<li>The Whaidians, vaguely culturally Arabic, are brutally destroyed by the CDF. I suspect there is a political agenda here as well, with parallels to the War on Terror.</li>
<li>A variety of other species which were only alluded to. A terrifying slime-mold which enters through your mouth and eats you from within. The Covandu, a tiny but intelligent species with high-tech weaponry, but so small they can be crushed underfoot like a bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why don't animals photosynthesize in addition to regular metabolism?</li>
</ul>

    <title>The Sabbath by Heschel</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This is a great example of a branch book (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Narrative,_tree,_and_branch_books">Narrative, tree, and branch books</a>), containing one big idea followed by elaboration. In this case, the core idea is that the Jewish Sabbath celebrates time over space, which is a rare thing to celebrate. The elaboration is a poetic meditation on time's superiority over space, and it quickly gets koan-like, but in a way that is less repetitive than <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Finite_and_Infinite_Games_by_James_Carse">Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse</a>.</p>
<h1>Sabbath: a cathedral in time</h1>
<p>"Where is god?" is often asked. It is assumed to be in a place. But what if instead, it is at a time? (Perhaps then, a better question to ask is "When is god"?)</p>
<p>It is not a thing that lends significance to a moment, but a moment that lends significance to things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meaning if the sabbath is to celebrate time rather than space. Six days a week we live under the tyrant of things of space; on the sabbath we try to become attended to the holiness in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a silly story I found evocative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Angels have six wings, one for each day of the week, with which they chant their song; but they remain silent on the Sabbath, for it is the Sabbath which then chants a hymn to God."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sabbath: the idea of a holy space is well understood. Not so the idea of a holy time. This in itself a beautiful insight. Rhymes with Finite and Infinite games, where the climax is arguably the abstract. But Heschel has more to offer.</p>
<h1>Sabbath is the end, not the means</h1>
<p>Philo of Alexandria, spokesman of Greek speaking Jews was famous for his ability to blend Roman philosophy with Jerusalem's theology. He provided a practical reason for Shabbat: even athletes need to take a break sometimes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a breathing spell enables athletes to collect their strength with a stronger force behind them to undertake promptly and patiently each of the tasks set before them. (Philo)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s not the case that the Shabbat serves some instrumental purpose. It is an end in and of itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sabbath is not for the sake of the weekdays. The weekdays are for the sake of the sabbath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A passage in the book reminded me of the idea of God via negation. I find this to be an extremely powerful framing that I actually resonate with, despite not really being religious (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Negative_theology_and_via_negativa">Negative theology and via negativa</a>). Like a sculptor chipping away in the latent space of concepts.</p>
<h1>Misery in space, solace in time?</h1>
<p>It is handy that the Jews, ever persecuted, forever wandering, sanctify a time, not a place. Very wise!</p>
<p>The Jewish tradition converted cyclical festivals into ones that celebrate specific events from historical time. For example, Pesach went from harvest holiday to a commemoration of the Jewish exodus from Egypt.</p>
<p>In the world of time, sabbaths are our great cathedrals. The holy of holies is Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>There is no Hebrew word for “thing”. Holiness of things is explicitly prohibited in idols and the story of the holy calf. It’s not a holy mountain or a holy sprint that was emphasized in Judaism. But instead a holy time.</p>
<h1>Freedom from technology</h1>
<p>Humanity has grown to know how to control space but we remain powerless to control time. So we try to use our time to make it subservient to space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time to us is sarcasm, a slick treacherous monster with a jaw like a furnace incinerating every moment of our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spirit of sabbath is to advance beyond technical civilization, become independent of it.</p>
<p>Big idea: Shabbat helps us to emphasize resilience and independence from technology. We should learn to live with things but not depend on them. We should learn to live with people but not be dependent on them. This resonates with me from the perspective of type two fun, (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Manufactured_suffering_for_resilience,_antifragility_and_happiness">Manufactured suffering for resilience, antifragility and happiness</a>). Along similar lines, one great way to get independent from tech is to go backpacking for a week... but I don't think this is the intent of the Sabbath.</p>
<h1>Sabbath as eternity</h1>
<p>Sabbath as eternity or a taste of the world to come:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A story is told about a rabbi who once entered heaven in his dream. He was permitted to approach the temple in Paradise where the great sages of the Talmud, the Tannaim, were spending their eternal lives. He saw that they were just sitting around tables studying the Talmud. The disappointed rabbi wondered, “Is this all there is to Paradise?" But suddenly he heard a voice: "You are mistaken. The Tannaim are not in Paradise. Paradise is in the Tannaim."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salvation through study or knowledge? I don't think I fully understand this yet, but it feels important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Rabbi Shimeon, eternity was not attained by those who bartered time for space but by those who knew how to fill their time with spirit. To him the great problem was time rather than space; the task was how to convert time into eternity rather than how to fill space with buildings, bridges and roads; and the solution of the problem lay in study and prayer rather than in geometry and engineering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Personal reflections</h1>
<p>Feels weird to be looking forward to Shabbat all week. Shouldn’t you aspire to enjoy every living moment? The restful aspect of sabbath adds variety to life, but if all of life were a sabbath, much would be lost.</p>
<p>One is supposed to love the sabbath in the way that chivalric knights love their ladies. Shabbat as a bride or a queen? These analogies fall flat for me.</p>
<p>Finding the balance between austerity (the way Shabbat still feels to me) and luxury “choice meals and beautiful garments” feels strange and unattainable.</p>
<p>The sabbath prohibitions are in place to prevent “vulgarization of the grandeur of the day”. The sabbath is for enjoying the best meals, the best clothes. I find it a challenge to bring this into practice, especially as a parent of young children!</p>
<p>The adage "buy experiences, not things" rhymes with some of the time over space wisdom in this book, although of course buying is far too vulgar, and explicitly prohibited on Shabbat.</p>

    <title>Impossible Owls by Brian Phillips</title>

        <p>It's hard to call these essays, because they have a tinge of magic to them, despite appearing to be completely factual. It's as if the fictional genre of magical realism has somehow found its non-fiction counterpart? Anyway, as A says, the boundary between fiction and non-fiction is overrated.</p>
<p>Enough philosophizing! I enjoyed this collection of essays, my favorite of which seem to include a lot of Brian Phillips' personal reflection as well as intense and interesting travelogues. The essays I enjoyed most evoked a strong feeling of I want to go to there. Like, maybe it's time to finally visit Alaska and do some backpacking around ~~McKinley~~ Denali? And yes, I'm definitely overdue for another Japan trip, and maybe I should try watching Star Trek TNG again, and how is it that I haven't seen the Soviet Tale of Tales cartoon? (Update: I did, and it was good.)</p>
<p>Part of what is appealing is how immersive the essays are, and the comprehensive picture that is painted in so short a passage. It feels like I’ve been there and back! This is helped by the fact that Phillips is a talented author, eg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the bureaucrats seized it from the priests years ago and, exercising their own power of transubstantiation, made it into something else. Now it is a puppet workshop that only happens to look like a church: in the same way that Eucharist blood once happened to taste like wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>England pulls the sea around her like a mantle: these waters our robe of ermine, these stars our imperial crown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another observation: Phillips is clearly from the internet, which shines through in the way he writes. But this does not detract from his writing, instead it somehow legitimates writers from very online culture I know so well.</p>
<p>I did find that there was some unevenness to the quality of the essays. Some of them didn't leave an impression at all, and some I thought were just weaker than others. I found the UFO essay to be a bit too unfocused, a mishmash of cultural tropes and Americana. My theory is that Phillips' own experience really add to the essays, and this was not always present. In other cases, the topics were too far from my interest.</p>
<p>A pointers to follow: Robert Service poems about Alaska &amp; co... pretty good, eg. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46643/the-spell-of-the-yukon">The Spell of the Yukon</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No! There’s the land. (Have you seen it?)
   It’s the cussedest land that I know,
 From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it
   To the deep, deathlike valleys below.</p>

    <title>The Timeless Way of Building</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The built world is defined by a small number of patterns, which keep repeating over and over and over again. The patterns are deep and mostly relational. This applies at all scales in human construction: to American cities, Gothic cathedrals, Paris, Chinese kitchens, doors, and so on.</p>
<p>These patterns can be codified into a pattern language. And just like a great writer or orator has an intuitive grasp of human language, a great builder can and should strive to attain an intuitive grasp of his pattern language.</p>
<p>But just because you have a pattern language does not make it good. A concrete jungle is also governed by a pattern language. Alexander strives to capture a collection of patterns that create a microcosm that has "The Quality Without a Name", which he defines via negativa (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Negative_theology_and_via_negativa">Negative theology and via negativa</a>). Here's a quick summary:</p>
<p><img alt="The Quality Without a Name" src="/assets/qwan.jpg" /></p>
<p>Subsequent books in the series present lists of specific patterns at various scale levels (eg. town, building, substructure) that Alexander wholeheartedly endorses.</p>
<h2>Tired: things I didn't love 😫</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stuffy tone</li>
<li>Exacerbated by the narrator's proper English accent in the audio book.</li>
<li>Dry prose. If I had a nickel for every "pattern of events" in some of those middle chapters...!</li>
<li>Overly universalist</li>
<li>The Quality Without A Name is supposed to span time and space. It's timeless, as per the title of the book, but this pomposity is the opposite of the egoless ideal.</li>
<li>Alexander makes sweeping claims like whether a pattern language is alive or dead is necessarily objective.</li>
<li>QWAN has a strong “you’ll know it when you see it” vibe. Alexander is really appealing to some imagined sense of universal taste.</li>
<li>Opinionated and tending negative</li>
<li>About architecture, including modern star architects, nature-inspired architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.</li>
<li>About specialization in general</li>
<li>About materials that tend to last forever like concrete and metal. They are inherently not alive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wired: things I loved 💗💗💗</h2>
<ul>
<li>The specific patterns found in the second volume "A Pattern Language", especially pertaining to buildings. I'd never thought of many of them, and now find myself viewing buildings through this patterned lens.</li>
<li>Every living thing is the product of a process. There is no way to creates a living thing by some direct process.</li>
<li>Trying to define QWAN as an overlap of many attributes, where none of the attributes on its own adequately describe it. Reminds me of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Negative_theology_and_via_negativa">Negative theology and via negativa</a></li>
<li>One of the attributes of QWAN is "Being Alive", which although vague is evocative. Design must be done with the idea of death. Nothing can be alive unless it can become dead (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Momento_mori">Momento mori</a>).</li>
<li>Only about 5% of buildings are designed by architects. The vast majority are constructed by following relatively simple patterns and rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspired: threads to pull on ✨🧵✨</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's difficult to describe what constitutes a rough circle. A precise circle is easy to quantify. It is the locus of points that are equidistant from a center. But naively defining a rough circle as some locus of connected points 5 to 6 cm away from a certain point might include zigzags, polygons, or other shapes that are totally not circle-like.</li>
<li>How would I algorithmically generate a rough circle? Sounds like a fun side project or interview question.</li>
<li>Alexander leans heavily on the environment as something that is critical for happiness. It does not come from within. I liked that he acknowledges that this is an untrendy claim to make, and explicitly defends his position. How much happiness comes from the self, and how much from the environment?</li>
<li>What are the pattern languages for 1940-59 builds in Seattle? What about the 1910 eta craftsmen? How about new modern builds going up now?</li>
<li>Can these design patterns be used to consider whether existing buildings are good? I am judging my house and my parents house from this vantage point.</li>
<li>What are the buildings and building patterns I like most?</li>
<li>In PYNY's house: great benches integrated into windowsills.</li>
<li>I took notes on this too, see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Design_Pattern_Languages_for_Single_Family_Homes">Design Pattern Languages for Single Family Homes</a>.</li>
<li>Can this be somehow adapted when considering what to look for in a new house? It's a bit like Marie Kondo's "do these underwear spark joy" question. Evocative but also silly.</li>
<li>Alexander implores us to design without drawing plans. Keep the whole project plan in the mind as you conceive it to be maximally flexible. As you add new patterns to the design, the whole system may need to morph, so any representation other than that of the mind's eye is too inflexible. This seems too extreme, but also somehow appealing.</li>

        <p>Ritual is closely associated with an ancient monolithic tradition, but Casper ter Kuile encourages us to cherry-pick the good parts from many traditions, and reconstruct your own rituals. At times, the book gives off obnoxious self-help vibes, other times it came off as overly woke. Overall, I'm pretty sure it was ghost written by a slightly flamboyant gay alien who just landed on Earth.</p>
<p>I am thankful that I personally don't need to reinvent rituals rom scratch, as I find myself firmly rooted in the Jewish tradition. In this tradition, rituals are glorified as an end in themselves (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Jewish_tradition_of_doing_first_and_understanding_later_-_na'aseh_v'nishma">Jewish tradition of doing first and understanding later - na'aseh v'nishma</a>). But I'm way too skeptical to embrace the whole canon wholesale.
That said, I'm much more inclined to ground myself in some traditional basis and make modifications, rather than start from "first principles". In Rationalist circles, unmoored by any traditional or religious foundation, solstice celebrations are fully made up. The result is inspiring in some ways, but also feel cringeworthy and a little bit fraudulent.</p>
<p>This book inspired me to start a journalling practice, and incorporate aspects of "prayer" into it. Also, I've implemented tech sabbath, which kicks in automatically on my devices from Friday 6pm to Saturday 6pm.</p>
<p>Here are my (slightly sanitized) notes on the book:</p>
<h1>Sacred reading and Lectio Divina</h1>
<p>I found value in the sacred reading idea that ter Kuile outlines, and appreciated his breakdown of various kinds of reading. The crux of the sacred practice is to read a text but then address questions that are far more broad ranging than the text as written. As an example of how far this practice can be stretched, ter Kuile points to his <a href="https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/">Harry Potter and the Sacred Text</a> podcast.</p>
<p>Adapted from Lectio Divina, here are four levels of analysis of a sacred text:</p>
<ol>
<li>Literal content: what is happening?</li>
<li>Allegorical content: what is this alluding to, what is the bigger meaning?</li>
<li>Personal reflection: what does this evoke in your personal experience?</li>
<li>Action: what do you want to do about it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lectio Divina comes from Christian tradition, but there are similar traditions in other cultures. In the Jewish tradition, ḥavruta is a study group structure often practiced in Yeshivas.</p>
<h1>A modern dearth of celebrations</h1>
<p>The author suggests insightfully that the reason that weddings are so overblown is to compensate for a dearth of rituals in our daily lives. In the mainstream west, there are no more harvest festivals, no real Easter celebrations, and not much for Christmas either.</p>
<p>The religious and spiritual calendar tends to follow a yearly cycle. Casper thinks we should embrace that more. There is something comforting about this cyclical nature, although it’s not a strict repetition of prior celebrations. The world changes, and you yourself change in some direction, leading to a spiral-like progression.</p>
<p>I am reminded of Rabbi Heschel's take on "Jewish time" and its emphasis on celebrating historical events as part of the yearly cadence. This, by the way, is from <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Notes_on_The_Sabbath_by_Heschel">Notes on The Sabbath by Heschel</a> which I am reading next.</p>
<h1>Connecting with nature</h1>
<p>A few lenses when connecting with nature:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nature is a resource for humans to exploit for our own purposes.</li>
<li>Nature is to be avoided. We should get away from it as far as possible.</li>
<li>Nature is like a lover.</li>
<li>We are part of nature not distinct from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perspectives one and two are dominant in our culture. Three I didn't quite understand, but I resonate with four.</p>
<p>A common worldview sees animals and plants as "individual sacks". In fact, the skin of a thing ecologically speaking much more like a pond surface than a sack or a shell. The author describes this as "delicate interpenetration", which is evocative if a bit disgusting. I strongly resonate with the idea of mutual interdependence, and the elation and suffering which is to be found in nature. Shared laughter and shared suffering is critical for community. Also see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Two_types_of_fun,_type_1_and_type_2">Two types of fun, type 1 and type 2</a>.</p>
<p>A technique: verbalize the landscape from its perspective. “I am the pond and the pond is me”</p>
<h1>A modern take on prayer</h1>
<p>Prayer can be viewed as way to getting yourself to verbalize how you truly feel. It feels reductive to use prayer as a journaling technique, but also really intriguing.</p>
<p>Four steps prayer framework:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decentering</strong>: stop thinking about your individual experience, and refocus on the profound.</li>
<li><strong>Contrition</strong>: what have I done that I shouldn’t have? Where have I gone astray? Incidentally this is all of Yom Kippur.</li>
<li><strong>Thanksgiving</strong>: give thanks for being alive. For the body, for health and people and meaning and joy. Recognize that the goodness comes from without, outside ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>Supplication</strong>: what one thinks about when one thinks of prayer: making requests. One approach is to sequence it, repeating three intentions. (1) Self, (2) someone we love or a stranger, (3) someone with whom you’re struggling (from Jack Kornfield)</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless a pretty literal god exists, this sort of prayer will not work directly to change the world. But it can change you. Why Journal?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk about who you are, and who you wish to become. Talk about what matters most. Unless we speak the truth, we will forget what we want to stay loyal to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhymes so much with the C. S. Lewis' Inner Circle and John Boyd's "To be somebody or to do something".</p>
<h1>Random</h1>
<ul>
<li>Spiritual music I should revisit: Arvo Pärt - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc">Spiegel im Spiegel</a></li>
<li>Beyond Monteverdi: Jacobus Clemens non Papa wrote some dope choral music, including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLRgLM0HHek">bunch of motets</a>.</li>
<li>Simone Weil wrote that god and prayer can be found in the most surprising places, like in a <a href="https://www.wabashcenter.wabash.edu/2018/08/simone-weil-on-study-prayer-and-love/">geometry problem</a>.</li>

    <title>The Toynbee Convector by Ray Bradbury</title>

        <p>I picked up this volume after reading The Toynbee Convector and really enjoying it. I'm surprised Ray Bradbury wrote so much horror and so little science fiction. Perhaps it's selection bias in this volume? Here are a few stories that really stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Let Me Remind You of Why We Are Here</strong>: resonates strongly on a personal level, exploring the nuances in communication between parents and children at various stages of that relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trapdoor</strong>: a slightly loony story about monsters in the attic. Creeepy and surprisingly compelling, very far from my usual taste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Last Circus</strong>: Ominous and timely once more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Banshee</strong>: Another horror tale that I enjoyed. He had it coming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bless me Father, For I have Sinned</strong>: who blesses the givers of blessings?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Touch of Petulance</strong>: Relationships are so complex. A self fulfilling time travel tragedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Come, and Bring Constance</strong>: Cute story with multiple possible interpretations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also really liked the titular story. Here's the basic premise: Craig Bennet Stiles travels a century into the future and returns with detailed descriptions and photographs of a bright future in which all of humanity's problems have been solved. This gives people hope in a hopeless world much like our own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You name it, we had it. The economy was a snail. The world was a cesspool. Economies remained an insolvable mystery. Melancholy was the attitude. The impossibility of change was the vogue. End of the world was the slogan.
...a fifth horseman, worse than all the rest rode with them: Despair, wrapped in dark shrouds of defeat, crying only repetitions of past disasters, present failures, future cowardices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is of course a giant twist which I will leave out, out of respect for you, dear reader. But you might piece together where things are going anyway.</p>
<p>Overall I loved it. One remarkable thing is that this is a truly consistent time travel story, no caveats. It left a strong impression on me and reified the power of positive visions (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Positive_visions_are_necessary">Positive visions are necessary</a>).</p>
<p>Stray thoughts still linger:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fake it 'till you make it is almost trite, but how much 'faking it' is too much?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much credence to give Toynbee's idea that "any group, any race, any world that did not run to seize the future and shape it was doomed to dust away to the grave, in the past"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Stiles a science fiction writer? So many technological efforts are inspired by fiction, even dystopian fiction (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Dystopian_fiction_that_inspires_real_products">Dystopian fiction that inspires real products</a>). In this light, this is a pretty self serving story, Mr. Bradbury!</p>

    <title>Wild Problems by Russ Roberts</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/wild-problems-by-russ-roberts"/>
    
    <updated>2022-09-22T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/wild-problems-by-russ-roberts</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Despite being a famous economist, Russ Roberts has a tendency to disparage his own field for its shortcomings. His core argument is that a lot of the thinking employed by economists applies to overly simplified models along the lines of "imagine a spherical cow". In particular, Roberts focuses on so-called Wild problems, which seem to be the same as Wicked problems (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Kind_and_wicked_problems">Kind and wicked problems</a>), but usually in the personal domain. The thrust of this short book is that such problems can’t be solved in a naïve way. Who to marry, who to hire, who to befriend, whether to have children? There are many different ways to live. There are many different destinations that you may pick for yourself, and which destination to pick is often the hardest part of the exercise.</p>
<p>Much of the book is spent on dismantling Subjective Expected Utility (SEU), and reifying Herb Simon's <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Bounded_rationality">Bounded rationality</a> observations. Examples familiar to me included Darwin’s famous marry/don’t marry note and Franklins “moral algebra” where pros and cons for making a tough decision are weighed against one another and crossed out until one column is longer than the other and you have an answer. Of course, this sort of moral algebra doesn't work. Firstly, it's very hard to quantify things that matter to us. Secondly, <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Values_are_incommensurable">Values are incommensurable</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Persi Diaconis</strong> was agonizing about a decision whether or not to move to Harvard from Stanford. He had bored his friends silly with endless discussion. Finally, one of them said, “You’re one of our leading decision theorists. Maybe you should make a list of the costs and benefits and try to roughly calculate your expected utility.” Without thinking, Persi blurted out, “Come on, Sandy, this is serious.”</p>
<p><strong>The Vampire Problem</strong> I really enjoyed a new-to-me thought experiment Roberts introduces, attributing L. A. Paul, of a man deciding whether to become a vampire. A human cannot imagine what it would be like to be a vampire because they have never been a vampire. In the same way, a woman cannot imagine what it would be like to become a mother until she has become one. Becoming a mother will fundamentally change you, your priorities, your tastes. Becoming a vampire too, will make you much more interested in drinking other people's blood and avoiding the sun. Such transformations involve a leap of faith. Whether to take it is not a decision that can be made using a decision matrix or rational deliberation.</p>
<p>So even bounded rationality is of little help in such transformative situations. On paper, having children is a terrible decision. Here, Roberts appeals to novelty. Becoming a parent is like getting tickets to Shakespeare's brand new play. You get to watch it with someone you love (hopefully), and you don’t know if it’s a tragedy or a comedy. Just do it and see. It’s part of being human and living a complete life.</p>
<p><strong>Flourishing over pleasure</strong> The problem with Benjamin Franklin's moral algebra is that values are incommensurable with one another. Furthermore, comparing things from the realm of economics (eg. money, things) with values, ideals, and principles is impossible. They are in distinct categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Things pertaining to <strong>flourishing</strong>, which tend to provide a backdrop for life spanning a long term. They form your identity.</li>
<li>Short term <strong>pleasures and pains</strong>: a nice meal, a flat tire. These are fleeting and have no long term bearing on life.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prioritize your principles</strong>. From this flourishing perspective, becoming a vampire is a bad idea. Your core values will not be satisfied even though the vampire you will become will get a lot of Hedons from drinking all that delicious human blood. 🧛</p>
<p>Roberts even combines this with <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Two_types_of_fun,_type_1_and_type_2">Two types of fun, type 1 and type 2</a>. You flourish from Type 2 fun, even though it may be less pleasurable in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Aside: picking a religion</strong>: This reminds me of the Khazar decision to pick Judaism based on a utilitarian argument: choosing Christianity or Islam would put them under the authority of either Baghdad or Constantinople. Later, when Vladimir converted the Rus to Christianity, he did it on similar utilitarian grounds:
- Of the <strong>Muslim</strong> Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them, only sorrow and a great stench. He also reported that Islam was undesirable due to its taboo against alcoholic beverages and pork. Vladimir remarked on the occasion: "Drinking is the joy of all Rus'. We cannot exist without that pleasure."
- Ukrainian and Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with <strong>Jewish</strong> envoys and questioning them about their religion, but ultimately rejecting it as well, saying that their loss of Jerusalem was evidence that they had been abandoned by God.</p>
<p><strong>The Penelope problem</strong>. The secretary problem is cleverly reframed as the “Penelope problem” from the perspective of Odysseus' wife who is besieged by 108 suitors. A very PC move, Roberts. Well played! Also, it's a good reminder that the correct percentage of houses to view first is 1/e or about 38% to establish a baseline to compare the rest against.</p>
<p>“The happy hypocrite” story is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Three kinds of people:</p>
<ol>
<li>No conscience. You get a kick from hedonism.</li>
<li>Conscience and you get a kick from doing the right thing</li>
<li>No conscience. But aspiring to find one.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Things I liked less</h1>
<p>It's unclear why Roberts adopts the new terminology "wild" versus "tame" problems? It seems neatly analogous to the preexisting terminology I first saw in <a href="/books/gardener-carpenter-by-alison-gopnik/">The Gardener and The Carpenter by Alison Gopnik</a> and <a href="/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/">Range - Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein</a>: <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Kind_and_wicked_problems">Kind and wicked problems</a>.</p>
<p>Roberts argues also that to become a vampire is unethical, which is fair enough. But then this vaguely is also mapped to being a non-parent, with an implied equivalence between vampires and non-parents, which is too extreme for my tastes.</p>
<p>In general, and I'm not sure this is avoidable, Roberts soapboxes a lot, imploring the reader to stick to his principles, fully trumping any utilitarian considerations. Ones values should always stand above the domain of economic utility. No amount of money should be enough to sway this. Reality is clearly more complex than this, and ultimately the difficult questions remain difficult.</p>
<p>Roberts' book concludes with some Vogon Poetry which seems slightly embarrassing to publish. Overall, I like the advice, but the whole thing just comes off as a little bit too much of like something that your highly intelligent but a little bit tipsy uncle would give you during a long heart-to-heart:</p>
<pre><code>Beware the urge for certainty.
The mortal lock.
The sure thing.
The lure of the bird in the hand.

Maybe once or twice, put all your eggs in one basket.
Take a chance
On romance. Ask her out. Or him.
Embrace doubt.
Go on a limb.
</code></pre>

    <title>Forever Flowing by Vasily Grossman</title>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This unfinished work begins as a novel, and ends as a scathing critique of the Soviet Union under Stalin.</p>
<p>Viewing the work from the perspective of a novel is slightly disappointing. Although the characters are compelling, the narrative arc is stunted, leaving a lot to be desired. Briefly, the emaciated Ivan returns from a 30 year stint at a gulag, only to meet his pudgy, talentless cousin Nikolai, who has made a great career for himself by being unprincipled. Ivan's wife found a new lover, and most of his friends have died in the camps. Ivan begins anew, finds a job and falls in love with a woman who eventually succumbs to cancer.</p>
<p>The narrative in this book is shadowed by Grossman's critical agenda. This work is listed as an inspiration for <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Bloodlands_by_Timothy_Snyder">Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder</a>, but adds extra color to the history described there. The strength of Grossman's work incorporates some interesting historical ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arendtian "Banality of Evil" was alive and well in Soviet Russia.</li>
<li>The strong Soviet state became an end in itself, to the detriment of the people.</li>
<li>The culture of informing on your neighbors was even more terrible than I thought.</li>
<li>The situation on the ground was in some ways even worse than what was described in Snyder.</li>
<li>Stalin was Lenin's true spiritual successor because Lenin's essence was thirst for power.</li>
<li>Russia's default state over the last millenium is totalitarian unfreedom.</li>
<li>The truly radical Russian Revolution was the end of Feudalism in 1861.</li>
<li>Lenin's legacy was as a totalitarian innovator, emulated by the Mussolini, Hitler, Mao, and other less-then-lovely humans.</li>
</ul>
<p>I elaborate on each idea in what follows.</p>
<h1>Banality of Evil in Soviet Russia</h1>
<p>Ivan's cousin Nikolai Andreyevich is very good at blending in to the (terrible) times. An adaptive chameleon without serious principles, but a self-described decent man, and truly well meaning. Sure, sometimes he agrees to sign an order to punish an enemy of the people, or condemn a Jew for his treasonous poisoning of a respected party member. But these people are certainly guilty, and deserve to be punished. All in a day's work for a well respected member of society. At any rate, it's a comfortable life.</p>
<p>Yet even for Nikolai, uncertainty lingers in the background. He knows really decent Jewish doctors personally. What if some of accused are innocent? Could it be that Stalin and the party are wrong? No — unthinkable. When, upon his death, Stalin turned out to be not such an infallible leader, things got uncomfortable really quickly.</p>
<p>The pudgy wine-drinking Nikolai, with his jowls and heavyset build, contrasts starkly to his principled, emaciated cousin. Sometimes Nikolai wished he could take Ivan's place in principled opposition, even if it meant thirty years in a gulag.</p>
<p>Grossman does an impressive job of explaining and understanding various kinds of traitors against humanity. He is able to apologize on their behalf and explain their behavior from their own perspective. Judas I, II, III and IV are all good men at their core. Some are erudite scholars, some have great respect for their parents, and love their children. All of these various flavors of everyman busy informing on one another. It's just what you do.</p>
<p>Yet even towards this scum, Grossman calls for moderation lest we become Stalinists ourselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Подумаем. Не подумавший не казни. Подумаем не торопясь, потом уж, приговор.
Think. Think before executing. Think, don't rush. Then later, we'll impose a sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Butchers and hairdressers: Moscow in the 50s</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Повсюду на домах имелись одни и те же вывески: «Мясо» и «Парикмахерская». В сумерках вертикальные вывески «Мясо» горели красным огнем, вывески «Парикмахерская» светились пронзительной зеленью. Эти вывески, возникшие вместе с первыми жильцами, как бы раскрывали плотоядную суть человека. Мясо, мясо, мясо… Человек жрал мясо. Без мяса человек не мог. Здесь не было еще библиотек, театров, кино, пошивочных, не было даже больниц, аптек, школ, но сразу, тотчас же, среди камня красным огнем светилось: мясо, мясо, мясо… И тут же изумруд парикмахерских вывесок. <strong>Человек ел мясо и обрастал шерстью</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Fifty words for "informant"</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Да. Все течёт. Все изменяетесь. Нельзя дважды вступить в один и тот же эшелон.
Everything flows. Everything changes. You cannot board the same gulag train twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Inuit have many words for snow. The Russians, for informing on your neighbors: клевета, стукачи, сексоты, доносчики, информаторы.</p>
<p>The greatest and most disgusting defence of this behavior was to deflect blame from the government, and attribute it to human nature itself. The baby grows into an informant organically through mothers milk. Humanity is naturally corrupt and people are either deserve to be informed on, or inform on others for personal gain. This deeply insidious position is still espoused by Russians today: a nihilism and fundamental pessimism about human nature. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Russia's_strategy_is_sowing_cynicism">Russia's strategy is sowing cynicism</a>.</p>
<p>This deflection was effective. Many gulag denizens believed in their own innocence (a clerical error) while insisting that the system was working as intended. Surely de-kulakification doesn’t just happen to hard working peasants. Those slackers deserved it!</p>
<p>In fact, the government was directly to blame. Not informing was potentially punishable by jail time. You could get ten years for NOT reporting on your friends. Women were often the main victims here, as wives would get ten year sentences for not reporting on their husbands. The more prominent the man taken to the gulag, the more women in his sphere would get taken away to women's camps: his mother, his wife, his sisters, his daughters.</p>
<p>Woman’s camps totally terrifying. Women would get ten year sentences for not reporting on their husbands. Prominent husbands would cause more women around them to get sent away to camps.</p>
<p>Stalin's system pre-emptively punished potential criminals. Those that were jailed and sent away weren’t usually guilty of any real opposition, merely belonged to some group that might tend, in the right circumstances, to have a higher probability to oppose the government. A terrifyingly high modernist stance, straight from Minority Report.</p>
<p>After Nikita Khrushchev dismantled Stalin's cult of personality, there were no consequences for those informants that did it for personal gain. All of the blame was attributed instead on Stalin personally, not on the system underlying the brutal famines and repressions.</p>
<h1>Atrocities beyond "Bloodlands"</h1>
<p>During the famines of 1932-33, NKVD checkpoints on roads prevented Kulaks starving in the villages from leaving. Many desperate enough to try to flee through the swamps met their deaths in the wilderness.</p>
<p>A PR campaign raged to try to conceal the famine from the population at large, but many city dwellers knew anyway and passengers on the Kiev-Odessa express would throw food out of their windows when traveling through famished Bloodlands so that villagers could scavenge for scraps near the train tracks after the train passed. Again, the authorities intervened and installed guards to lock car windows when passing through starving regions.</p>
<p>As the famine eased and villagers were able to claw their way back into the cities, Grossman vividly describes bread lines were unlike any other. A line of people, each hugging the person in front to ensure their place oscillated like a wave. Every hungry stumble created a ripple through the line, but it stood firm. I found this image of emaciated people, clinging on for dear life and howling from hunger visceral and terrifying.</p>
<h1>The strong state, an end in itself</h1>
<p>Those faithful to the original bolshevik vision of international communism became unnecessary ideologues for Stalin. When the tides shifted and the idea of the Comintern fell out of favor, the old internationalist dogs needed to be put down. How to best do this? Declare them enemies. Hence the Stalinist repressions of 1937-39. Stalin was tired of this entourage of useless old dogs following him around, so he simply murdered them, at scale.</p>
<p>The soviet state was purportedly created for the benefit of the people: the workers, the farmers. A strong state was established as a means to achieve this end, but sometime in the early decades of the Soviet Union, the original goal was forgotten. Over time, the means became the end. For Stalin, crushing a few million people became the new means to the real end: a strong state.</p>
<h1>Stalin as Lenin's true spiritual successor</h1>
<p>Grossman quotes a <a href="http://esenin-lit.ru/esenin/text/lenin-2.htm">Yesenin's "Lenin"</a>, evoking the dark image of encasing Lenin's legacy in concrete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Его уж нет!
А те, кто вживе,
А те, кого оставил он,
Страну в бушующем разливе
Должны заковывать в бетон.
Для них не скажешь:
"Ленин умер!"
Их смерть к тоске не привела...
Еще суровей и угрюмей
Они творят его дела.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who, asks Grossman rhetorically, should be Lenin's successor? Would it be the brilliant, turbulent, magnificent Trostky? The charming, gifted political theorist Bukharin? Perhaps the one closest to the workers Rykov? Maybe the well educated, confident, and sophisticated governor Kamenev? Last but not least, the one best versed in international labor, Zinovyev?</p>
<p>All of these men embodied aspects of Lenin's multifaceted personality, but none of them captured the essence of his soul: thirst for power. Stalin executed all of them, eliminating these subsidiary aspects of early Soviet rule which were merely getting in the way. The real goal was to raise and strengthen Lenin's banner over Russia, consolidate power, and build a powerful state.</p>
<p>To Grossman, Lenin’s intolerance, his firmness, his fanaticism all stem from the centuries of Russian unfreedom and intolerance. Grossman sees Stalin not as a huge departure from Lenin's tenure, but as a logical continuation of former events, and a cementing (as per Yesenin) of the existing path.</p>
<h1>Russia's default state: totalitarian unfreedom</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Лишь одного не видела Россия за тысячу лет: свободы
The one thing Russia has not seen in a thousand years: freedom.</p>
<p>Особенности русской души рождены несвободой. Русская душа тысячелетния раба.
Particularities of Russian spirit emerge from unfreedom. One thousand years a slave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freedom had almost no grounding in Russian history at all. Any notions of liberalism are entirely imported from western thought. The government was only democratic for two brief moments: the period of 1905-1917, then again roughly 1991-2000.  Other than that, the default state of Russia for the last millennium has been unfreedom.</p>
<p>Grossman writes almost from a Eurasianist perspective, emphasizing Stalin's veneer of culture on top of a Mongol yoke core. Stalin's Russia was certainly the successor of the Tatar-Mongol empire.

<p>There are a surprisingly large number of words for serf in Russian: крепостной, холоп, ишак.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Этот  азиат  в  шевровых  сапожках,  цитирующий Щедрина, живущий законами кровной мести и одновременно пользующийся словарем революции, внес ясность в послеоктябрьский   хаос,  осуществил,  выразил  свой  характер  в  характере государства.
This khan in velvet boots, citing Schedrin and living by the law of the jungle, used the language of revolution to bring clarity to the post-October chaos and projected his own character into that of the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The Real Russian Revolution: Ending Feudalism</h1>
<p>For Grossman, the real revolution in Russian history was the prohibition of serfdom in the 1861. The Revolution of 1917 and the rise of Lenin and Stalin is a reversion to Russia default state of unfreedom.</p>
<h1>Lenin: totalitarian innovator</h1>
<p>Glimpses of Russian influence were imagined during the height of Russia's monarchic peak a century before the revolution of 1917, but never like this.</p>
<p>Rather than shining as a beacon for those dreaming of a communist utopia, Lenin's Soviet Russia rose up as an example of a simpler totalitarian society for the west to emulate. First Italy, then Nazi Germany followed suite. Leninism inspired authoritarian regimes in Asia too, including Communist China. Its legacy continues, with menacing echoes into the present day.</p>

        <p>The Goal: A Business Graphic novel is crass, outdated and overly on the nose. At the same time, it is a relatively entertaining illustrated introduction to a boring idea (a management paradigm). For this alone, I can't help but recommend it.</p>
<p>Alex Rogo directs a plant at Unico. He’s struggling to turn his business around and the CEO has just given him an ultimatum. I've never read a business novel before, and the combination of words is surprising. Is Rogo up to his managerial task? (Of course, otherwise there would be no hero's journey... But how?) Like “Obi Wan Kenobi instructing Luke Skywalker on the use of the force”, his former professor turned consultant Jonah saves the day.</p>
<p>The formulation of a business seems very crass and slightly outdated. None of this ESG shit; the goal is to make money. How? In a nutshell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maximize throughout: the rate at which the system generates money through sales.</li>
<li>Inventory: all money the system has invested in purchasing things it intends to sell.</li>
<li>Minimize operational expenses: all money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughout.</li>
</ol>
<p>I enjoyed the vignette of Alex Rogo taking a group of boyscouts including his son on a backpacking trip. He is faced with the challenge of making sure everyone safely arrives at the destination and managing their various abilities. One boy, Herbie seems to always be lagging behind, slowing the group down. When Rogo investigates, it turns out that he is carrying the large and heavy tent. By redistributing the tent parts between the rest of the boys, everyone is slightly more burdened, but the group is able to establish a much faster pace.</p>
<p>This boyscouts story is directly analogous to the factory production line, where some resources are bottlenecks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bottleneck resources - capacity is less than or equal to demand placed on it. It's a constraint</li>
<li>Non-bottleneck resources - capacity is greater than demand.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so this is Eliyahu M. Goldratt's Theory of Constraints: look for bottlenecks and optimize the system accordingly. In the fictional plant in the story, quality control initially happened after an expensive bottleneck. One of Jonah's insights was that it was far more efficient to do quality control before the bottleneck and discard parts before they pass through the expensive bottleneck.</p>
<p>Bottlenecks should always have a queue waiting on them. They are critical pieces that, if scaled, would greatly improve efficiency. Conversely if they sit idle, it’s a complete waste of resources. A bottleneck sitting idle means the whole plant is effectively sitting idle, with no throughput.</p>
<p>But also having huge queues of parts waiting on a bottleneck is a bad idea. It means somewhere in the system something is working too hard. So running non-bottleneck resources at maximum capacity is dumb. It’ll just create a giant queue of stuff stuck in the bottleneck. Reallocate resources.</p>
<p>Jonah suggests: work backwards from total throughput to have each part of the process output parts at the right rate. So avoid massive queues and make sure bottlenecks are operating at 100%.</p>
<p>Of course once the bottleneck has been resolved throughout increases. And now another bottleneck is in the way. And so on.  This is essentially an optimization process.</p>
<p>A funny parable to summarize the concept involves Jonah visiting the Rogo household and having the kids devise solutions to the Herbie hiking problem. His daughter suggests the boyscouts march to the best of a drum (i.e. constrained by the bottleneck), while his son suggests they also provide ropes so that the campers stay close together but without too much rigidity (ie. to be more resilient if there are random fluctuations.)</p>
<p>The whole book has a sleazy vibe to it. In one scene, Alex bets the head of sales that they will produce a quantity of units a new pair of Gucci loafers. And in the end, Alex wins the battle with the terrible accounting division, who is trying to subdue Alex's creative problem solving. Gotcha!</p>

        <p>At first I was taken by the surprisingly well written prose (for a non-fiction book). Here Lorr recollects his feelings after having lived abroad for a while and seeing an American supermarket for the first time in a while. This feeling of awe is familiar to me having immigrated from the Soviet Union in 1990:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A love like all love filled with doubt and rage and insecurity, but also overwhelming and blanketing, warm and intoxicating. It was a love of re-acclimation, of reabsorbing a childhood and birthright, of seeing myself and my country with new eyes, both fearful and reverent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is a memory conveyed remarkably well in writing of the olfactory experience of cleaning a whole foods fish freezer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...ten thousand minnows piled up in silver ribbons, left for days, as they waited to be transformed into the protein base of the aquaculture pyramid. Those were some strong sniffs. And yet none of it—not the trash fish nor fecal lagoons—was as fundamentally gross and disturbing as the smell that came out of that fish case in Manhattan. In a Whole Foods. In one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the wealthiest nation in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned that SKUs stand for "Shop Keeping Units", and that the average adult spends 2% of their life in a supermarket.</p>
<p>Despite the relative interestingness, the book kind of drones on. The section on Trader Joe's was overly fanboyish and protracted. Further, I am ashamed to admit that my interest in groceries and supply chains appears to be dwindling as the pandemic comes to a close.</p>

    <title>Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>At a high level, Bloodlands is a deep look into a variety of organized mass killings conducted by the Nazis and Soviets from roughly 1932 to about 1953 in The Bloodlands, loosely defined as territories in Eastern Europe, centered on modern Ukraine, but including modern Poland, Belarus, the Baltic states, and western Russian regions occupied by Germany. Snyder estimates 14 million non-combatant victims, 2/3 of which were murdered by the Nazis, 1/3 by the Soviets.</p>
<p>I was brought up with a Russian perspective on the Great War: we carried the whole damn thing. In school, I was learned the Canadian-American perspective on World War II: we saved the day  in the nick of time and owned the war in the Pacific. My Jewish background gave me a good sense for the horrors of the Shoah. I lost two great grandfathers in The Bloodlands, one murdered by Stalin in the repressions of 1938, another murdered by the Nazis as a Soviet POW in 1942.</p>
<p>Snyder's work integrates all of these disparate pieces and more into a coherent and truly terrifying narrative. He emphasizes the interactions between Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany, and the similarities between the two regimes. This view is distinct from any I had experienced. The events described are so terrible, I searched online multiple times to find a credible takedown of Snyder's work, but to no avail.</p>
<hr />
<p>Broadly speaking, the events in the book can be separated into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-war Soviet Russia (1933-1939): Characterized by large scale Stalinist repressions.</li>
<li>Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (1939-1941): Russia was allied with Germany and mostly ganged up against Poland.</li>
<li>Allied Russia (1941-1945): Germany engaged in mass killing of Soviet POWs, then Jews and other minorities.</li>
</ol>
<p>The breakdown of victims in these events is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starvation of Ukrainians by the Soviets in 1932-33 (Holodomor): 3.3 million.</li>
<li>Great Terror of 1937-38: 300,000 people, mostly poles and Ukrainians. 400,000 more outside the Bloodlands.</li>
<li>Soviet and Nazi oppression of Poles and Balts from 1939-41: 200,000.</li>
<li>German starvation in 1941-44: 4.2 million soviet citizens.</li>
<li>Nazi Jewish killings (Holocaust): 5.4 million Jews.</li>
<li>German killings of Polish and Belorussian partisans in 1942-44: 700,000 civilians shot during the occupation of the western soviet union.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Triple occupation: Soviets, Nazis and back again</strong>. Many of the territories in question were triply occupied: first by the Soviets, then the Nazis, and back again to the Soviets.</p>
<p><strong>Stalin enabled Hitler</strong>. Stalin's brutal collectivization and ensuing famines paved the way for Hitler to point to the transgressions of the communists. He rode that wave to consolidate power in Germany. This in turn reduced Comintern prestige globally and strained Russia German relations.</p>
<p><strong>Jews as communists</strong>. The communist party was largely Jewish, a fact the media gleefully covered for decades in the 1920 and 1930s. When Stalin's communists began committing mass murder at an unprecedented scale, this played into the propaganda of the Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>Ethnic composition of the NKVD</strong>. The founder of the NKVD, Felix Dzerzhinsky, was a Polish nobleman by birth, and Poles were highly represented in the NKVD at its foundation. Snyder claims that 40% of the NKVD were Jewish in ethnicity, which is shockingly high and somewhat <a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/45384/did-40-of-the-nkvd-soviet-police-leadership-have-jewish-nationality">controversial</a>. Both Poles and Jews were systematically purged, and by 1940, the party was more ethnically Russian than the general population. The only more represented ethnicity were Georgians, largely because of Stalin’s nepotism.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern European Nazi collaborators</strong>. Many Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Poles, Belorussians, and Ukrainians collaborated with the Nazis in their Jew killing venture. The jews were a convenient scapegoat for the ills of the Soviets. By agreeing that the Jews were at fault and needed to be purged, they saved their own skin from the wrath of the nazis.</p>
<p><strong>European polarization</strong>. Europe was so polarized by 1936 that it was impossible to criticize the Soviet Union without appearing to endorse Hitlers Germany. Hitler called his enemies Marxists. Stalin called his Fascists. They agreed there was no middle ground.</p>
<p><strong>Murderous troikas</strong>. A shockingly high number of people were killed by Stalinist Troikas, which consisted of three administrators from various levels of government, acting as judge jury and executioner.</p>
<p><strong>Japan's role</strong>. The Russo-German alliance 1939-41 sidelined the Japanese, who were Germany's natural ally and Russia's natural enemy. What would happen, speculates Snyder, if rather than purging its own citizenry, Stalin focused on disarming Japan and preventing the War in the Pacific? The course of the war might have been altered drastically, and perhaps not for the better... Imagine no Pearl Harbor?</p>
<p><strong>Mass starvation as a geopolitical strategy</strong>: Much of Ukraine suffered greatly in Stalin's attempts to convert Kulaks into collective farmers. Later, because Ukraine was still the breadbasket of the Soviet Union and supplied major Russian cities, Hitler would just starve the Russian urban elites (necessary anyway) and feed the Germans instead. This was literally called the Hunger Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Gareth Jones, journalist of the Holodomor</strong>. Jones, a Welshman, described the soviet atrocities and described the widespread famine in detail. After being banned from re-entering the Soviet Union, Jones was kidnapped and murdered in 1935.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown war crimes</strong>. The scale of the Stalinist program was completely unknown outside of soviet Russia. And even in Soviet Russia it was not at all widely known. (How much clandestine terror happens behind closed doors today? At what scale can such things operate in a world of internet and social media?)</p>
<p><strong>Personal stories help re-humanize people</strong>: This masterwork does an impressive job of combining the birds eye view with deeply troubling personal stories. Snyder writes eloquently about the importance of the latter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nazi and Soviet regimes turned people into numbers some of which we can only estimate. It is for us as scholars to seek these numbers and put them into perspective. It is for us as humanists to turn these numbers back into people. If we cannot do that, then hitler and Stalin have shaped not only our world but our humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Names and history of Donetsk</strong>. Bizarrely, the city of Donetsk was founded in 1869 by Welsh businessman John Hughes, an energy magnate. It was originally named Юзовка after Hughes but by 1931 it was renamed to Stalino. It was renamed to Donetsk by Khrushev as part of destalinization in 1961.</p>
<p><strong>Jews: shot and gassed</strong>. Jews living east of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line tended to be shot. Those living in German Reich territory tended to be gassed. Gassing techniques were first perfected for mass euthanasia of disabled and elderly “useless eaters”. Rather than running the exhaust of a truck into its cab, they took out the ICE of trucks and put them into buildings to increase the scale of the killings. First perfected at Belzec (“Boo-jets”), this was also used in Treblinka and other death camps like Sobibor.</p>
<p><strong>Let them destroy each other</strong>
- The West stood by as Russia and Germany waged war on one another, hoping to let the Nazis and Communists destroy one another without lifting a finger.
- The Soviets let the Poles rise up against the Nazis during the Warsaw uprising and falsely promised reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>Polish lack of control</strong>. Stalin bullied Churchill into labeling the Polish resistance as “adventurers”, and forced the rest of the Allies to do the same. This move was heavily condemned by Koestler and Orwell. Thus the Polish Home Army was not able to retain any control over Warsaw. By the end of the war Stalin finally allowed Allied powers to liberate Warsaw, but he delayed enough that the Soviets had de facto control, not the Polish government in exile.</p>
<p><strong>Soviet alternative history</strong>.
- According to Soviet history books, the war started in 1941 not in 1939. There could be no mention of the Nazi-Soviet alliance against Poland.
- To the Soviets, Russians needed to be the main victims of the Great War, not the Jews. Thus the Holocaust could not become part of the official history of the war.</p>
<p><strong>Solomon Michoels and the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee</strong> attempted to bring the plight of the Jews to the attention of the world. He petitioned Stalin to allow to publish the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Soviet_Jewry">The Black Book of Soviet Jewry</a> written by Red Army reporters Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman. But this initiative was blocked. Michoels political campaigning led him to be murdered by Stalin (officially a truck accident). A surprising group of high profile activists including violinist <a href="https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/jewish_anti-fascist_committee">David Oistrakh</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Death camps, not concentration camps</strong>. Snyder really drives home the point that concentration camps were just the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of Jews killed in the Shoah had never seen one or been in one. Many hundreds of thousands were shot are gassed in death facilities. The emphasis on concentration camps probably comes from media coverage shortly after the war as well as personal accounts from survivors. Case in point, Hannah Arendt's work is mostly about Auschwitz.</p>
<p><strong>Poles and Polish Jews</strong>. Polish Jews suffered the worst fate at the hands of the Germans. The worst parts of Poland were due to the Jews according to the Nazi stereotype. Polish Jews in the military were represented heavily, especially doctors, which was an affront to the Nazi world view. 90% of the Jews living in Poland were killed by the end of the war. Those that survived had no desire to return home, afraid of the displaced Poles that would resist if they they would try to retake their homes. Most fled via Germany to Israel or the United States. Before the war, 3 million Jews lived in Poland. By the end of it, and after the Polish communist anti-Semitism of the 60s, 30,000 remained. The non-Jewish Poles also suffered disproportionately compared to other non-Jewish ethnicities. Even so, a Jewish Pole was 15x more likely to die than their non-Jewish counterpart.</p>
<p><strong>Jewish resistance</strong>. A unified front of armed Jews came to be known as the Jewish Combat Organization. They sought to kill heads of the Judenrat and Jewish informants. Most of the action was in the Warsaw ghetto. By 1943 they had managed to kill some Nazis too, which led to a German vendetta against the Warsaw ghetto. When the Nazis came to destroy it they were met with sniper fire and Molotov cocktails. Called by some the “Jewish German War”, this resulted in the Nazis razing the Warsaw ghetto and turning it into a concentration camp.</p>
<p><strong>Resettlement</strong>: When the Nazis "resettled" Jews, this was used as a euphemism for mass murder. Resettlement from the Warsaw ghetto involved "deportation" of 250,000 Jews to the Treblinka death camp. Post-war Stalin used the same term to actually resettle people en mass. These were also brutal endeavours, and thousands died in transit, many traveling in open train cars in the bitter cold. The Germans suffered greatly after the war, dehumanized as a nation for the atrocities of the Nazis. As the Red Army pressed west, soldiers raped German women, and killed the men or took them as laborers.</p>
<p><strong>"Respecting" national boundaries</strong>. After the end of the war, Stalin implemented policies which segregated nations into their own national boundaries. In some cases, these boundaries were drawn up arbitrarily. Stalin effectively moved Poland westward, annexing eastern Poland into the soviet Ukraine at the expense of east German lands given to Poland. Germany would be for the Germans once more, just like Hitler envisioned but a much smaller territory. There was a large consensus throughout the word that each nation should be defined by its own nationality living within it.</p>
<p><strong>Who to surrender to?</strong>
- The Poles had to decide whether to surrender to the Wehrmacht or the Red Army in 1939, when they were attacked simultaneously by Germany from the west and Russia from the east. This was a tricky choice.
- The Germans had to decide when they were attacked by the Russians from the east and by other allies from the west. This was a no brainer: flee westward as quickly as possible.
- It's like an especially horrifying version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC10VWDTzmU">You Gotta Serve Somebody</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bloodlands, named for an Ахматова poem</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Не бывать тебе в живых,
Со снегу не встать.
Двадцать восемь штыковых,
Огнестрельных пять.
Горькую обновушку
Другу шила я.
Любит, любит кровушку
Русская земля.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stalin and Israel in 1948</strong>. Moscow was initially very sympathetic to Israel, seeing it potentially as fertile soil for communism. There was elation in Moscow when Golda Meir, originally from Kyiv, visited during Rosh Hashanah 1948. However Stalin quickly changed his mind, finding that Jews had more influence on the Soviet state than the Soviet state did on Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Stalinist Anti-semitism</strong>. Around 1949, Stalin began a concerted campaign against the Jews of Soviet Union. Many Jewish poets writing under Russian synonyms were arrested and killed as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Murdered_Poets">Night of the Murdered Poets</a> (including Leib Kvitko), followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors%27_plot">Doctor's Plot</a> which was diffused only by Stalin's death. Jews were now suspected of either being "Jewish Nationalists" or being "Rootless Cosmopolitans", with their names placed in parentheses in official lists. Increasingly Israel was seen as a client state of America, which led to fundamental aversion to the country.</p>
<p><strong>Molotov's wife</strong>. Molotov's wife Polina Zhemchuzhina was Jewish and accused of having Zionist ties for her support of the Jewish Anti-Fascists. A close friend of Stalin's wife Nadezhda (another murky story), she was arrested for treason in 1948, and forced into an unwanted divorce from Μolotov. She was convicted and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, released only after Stalin's death.</p>
<p><strong>Body counts and overlapping identities</strong>. In a the perverted contest between nations for greater victimhood that ensued after the war ended, there is is a tendency to inflate numbers of dead. Russia still clings on to the Soviet number of dead even though for example very few Russian Jews died in the holocaust (60k) compared to those of The Baltics, Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. Part of the exaggerated counts can be legitimately attributed to overlapping identity. The Polish Jew living in eastern Poland might have been under Soviet, German, then Soviet occupation again, before fleeing to Israel. This means she could be considered Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Soviet, German, or Israeli.</p>

<ul>
<li>Check out Vassiliy Grossman. In my mind, at least, he seems to be in the same category as Arendt: bearing witness. Novels that might be worthwhile: Life and Fate, and Everything Flows.</li>
<li>Read more Анна Ахматова poems.</li>

        <p>Many misses, for sure. But the hits I enjoyed were worthwhile:</p>
<p><strong>Imperial message</strong>: a great image of an emperor so important and surrounded by such a large number of people that a messenger cannot possibly escape his orbit. A message delivered to the second person recipient will never be delivered. Bureaucracies. Perhaps solar systems. Your own mind. Sometimes there is no escape.</p>
<p><strong>Tower of Babel and The City Coat of Arms</strong>: Cute vignette of the construction of the tower delayed because of peoples insistence that progress is imminent, and that if we just wait a bit the whole project will be done much faster. So why bother starting? As generations pass, the nations living in the city planning to build the tower begin squabbling. Towards the end, a prophecy emerges that the lord will crush the city with five successive blows from a divine fist. Hence the fist on the coat of arms of the city.</p>
<p>A bizarre take on Tower of Babel, featuring bureaucratic dysfunction and learned helplessness.</p>
<p><strong>Before the law</strong>: A man seeks entrance into The Law (I think the Torah version), but is prevented from entering by a guard because it is not time yet. The two exchange words and the man decides to wait until the time will come. He waits for many years, and the two have occasional conversations revealing that beyond this door lie more doors, with more guards. The man is undeterred and continues to wait. Near death, he gathers up the courage to ask his most pressing questions. After answering them, the guard announces he will be closing the door.</p>
<p>This short parable is told by a Priest, and the bulk of the story involves K. (Kafka?), the receiver of the story in conversation with the priest about various interpretation of the story. Is the man deluded? Is the guard? Who is more free?</p>
<p>A fascinating, self-referential, format. I see the man as a stand-in for K., and the priest as a stand-in for the guard. Where does the reader fit? What about the author? Reminds me a lot of Borges, and a little bit of Ted Chiang. (I’d love to do a group reading session around a story like this. I miss my Multiplayer Essay concept.)</p>
<p><strong>Poseidon</strong>: tracks the gate of an unhappy executive, appointed God of the Sea in the beginning, but perpetually unhappy, pining for “more cheerful work”. He was unable to sufficiently delegate to his subordinates and burned out completely.</p>

        <p>It's pretty funny but in a very high falutin’ way, which detracts from the
comedy.</p>
<p>Isn’t that conjecture just Laplace’s Demon? From WP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laplace's demon is a hypothetical all-knowing being who knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, and therefore could use Newton's laws to reveal the entire course of cosmic events, past and future. Based upon the philosophical proposition of causal determinism.</p>

<p>Septimus &amp; Chater demanding satisfaction exchange is hilarious!</p>
<p>Overall I’m struggling to follow the arc. Lots of wit but just very much a
comedy of errors. I might try again when I'm in a more frivolous headspace.</p>
<p>A stray thought: I haven't tended to really enjoy plays much. Is this a lack of
imagination on my part? Perhaps it takes more work to truly imagine each
character delivering their lines without any of the scaffolding a narrator
provides...</p>

      <div>
        <p>I recently ran a book club at work discussing <a href="/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio">Range</a>, and CB mentioned that this book is less Gladwellian and more nuanced covering a similar theme.</p>
<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of "Flow" fame is a psychologist, and takes a qualitative user research approach to the subject of creativity. He conducted interviews with 91 people that were deemed creative because of their impact on a field or because they helped to create a new one. He selected industry vets: people aged 60 and above from a variety of fields and cultures. Overall some gems but not without issues especially towards the end, where the book becomes less psychology and more self-help.</p>
<p><strong>Trend towards specialization</strong>. Imagine three people: one a physicist and a musician and one that is both. All things equal, the specialists would probably be better at their crafts than the one that has chosen to split his attention between both. This naive treatment clearly foreshadows the possible benefits of the two fields interacting with one another. Like cross-training in sports.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity and unhappiness?</strong>: Mihaly's research disconfirms the trope of the restless and miserable creative soul. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky aren’t unhappy because they are creative but because of their residence in a nearly collapsing Russian empire. American poets that commit suicide do it because of their social circles and their poor compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity is social</strong>: the author presents a socially mediated view of creativity. Society ultimately decides if you are creative or not. If you think you are creative but nobody else agrees, you might just be a kook!</p>
<p><strong>Three kinds of creativity</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brilliant</strong>: People with varied interests and a quick wit. Great conversationalists.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Creativity</strong>: People who see the world in a unique way, different from others.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: People who change the world by introducing some new concept, technique, or invention. This is the emphasis of the book and what the author means by</li>
</ol>
<p>There isn’t any correlation between these types. Many brilliant people are not creative. Many personally creative people don't have any impact. But creative people change the world in some significant way. This notion of Creativity reminds me more of the distinction <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Novelty_creation_invention_innovation_terms">Novelty creation invention innovation terms</a>. Feels like the sense is after is the strongest: innovation. It must have impact.</p>
<p>Paradoxically whether someone is Creative or Personally Creative depends on society. Bach was not recognized as creative until several generations after his death when Mendelssohn re-discovered him. So you would have to say that he was only posthumously creative. Weird flex, but the author embraces it. Other examples include John Donne, a 16th century poet, who fell into obscurity only to be revived in the 20th century by TS Eliot. Van Gogh who was never recognized during his life.</p>
<p>Talent is also orthogonal to creativity. You might just be in the right place at the right time. Genius is also not required, and most creative people don't identify as such. Genius is mostly a label others apply to describe the most standout individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Three requirements for creativity</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Domain: an area of inquiry.</li>
<li>Field (community): the gatekeepers in this area, the scene and people</li>
<li>Individual: using the symbols of a Domain, a person creates something that is approved by the Field.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Somewhat weird distinction between 1 and 2. Domain is the subject, field is the people.)</p>
<p>Why are there so many great architects and painters in the Italian Renaissance? Obviously not because some individuals (3) randomly got really creative. It’s more about the domain (1) and field (2). In other words, it’s the collective scenius that empowers individuals (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Four_ingredients_for_Scenius">Four ingredients for Scenius</a>). This is an insightful reminder. Still individual administrators and patrons can help or hurt here. For example the Medici played their part in catalyzing this Renaissance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Filippo Brunelleschi's Duomo at Florence.</li>
<li>Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structured vs. diffuse domains</strong>: Some domains are structured and so it’s easy to understand great contributions to the domain quickly. A student can chime in with a groundbreaking idea and professor may be able to evaluate it on the spot. (Eg. physics). Others are diffuse and so insights take many years to properly evaluate. (Eg. personality psychology).</p>
<p>Interesting framing on culture. Culture is something that rank orders attention. If all paintings are equally worthwhile, there is no culture. This is inherently a competitive process.</p>
<h1>Traits of creative people</h1>
<p><strong>Curiosity</strong> is a key trait found in all interview subjects. If you don’t remain curious, you are unlikely to persevere in adversity (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/What_can_increase_curiosity">What can increase curiosity</a>). Many people in the sample tended to follow their interests (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Follow_your_interests">Follow your interests</a>).</p>
<p>Many were the beneficiaries of <strong>cultural capital</strong> from their upbringing. Coming from a family of books and broad interests all lead to an advantage.</p>
<p>Also you needed a <strong>basic amount of social skills</strong> to enter into a field and convince people of your worth. Even Isaac Newton, notorious for his antisocial ways, had to convince an early mentor of his promise.</p>
<p><strong>Creative personality?</strong> Not really a thing, argues the author. But he thinks that people that are creative tend to have a complex personality, containing <strong>multitudes of personas within one individual</strong>. They are often able to express a lot of different emotions and be a bit unpredictable. This resonates and reminds me of AC and AK and IB and other great designers I've worked with.</p>
<p><strong>Contradictory traits</strong>: According to Jung, every strong suit has a shadowy side. This is very clearly an inspiration for Joe Edelman and well expressed in the game we played at HumSys called <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Out_of_Character_game">Out of Character game</a>. The author provides a list of contradictory traits that a creative person typically has. Ordinarily this would be asinine, but the way this is presented in the book is generative and not prescriptive.</p>
<p>Importantly, it’s not about striking a bland balance in between the two poles, but about knowing when to practice each extreme, and be flexible in switching between the poles as needed. I found this to be very insightful. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Polarity_strategy_—_alternate_between_poles_rather_than_finding_middle_ground">Polarity strategy — alternate between poles rather than finding middle ground</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Energetic, yet able to scale back energy as needed. For the mood or the flexibility. Sexually driven yet practicing abstinence.</li>
<li>Smart enough to master a field but naive enough to ask probing questions that others might take for granted.</li>
<li>Able to practice both divergent and convergent thought. Flexibility and originality is important for divergence. But you still need to converge. Good judgement and recognizing a viable problem is extremely important there. If most people have a 5% success rate in their ideas but you can achieve 50%, you have a much higher chance of striking gold.</li>
<li>Playful but disciplined.</li>
<li>Introverted sometimes but extroverted at other times. You need time to focus and write, but also key to know the field and get feedback from peers.</li>
<li>Masculine and feminine features. Psychologically androgynous.</li>
<li>High highes and low lows. More pleasure, fun, excitement about the intrinsic pleasure of the process of doing the work. Simultaneously, after the euphoria of completion expires or when you are blocked (eg. Writers block), there are low lows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important: you can’t just seek novelty. To strive to be unique is to be like anything BUT something. This is a negative framing and rarely generative. Similar critiques to postmodernism (not modernism), and denazification. (See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Positive_visions_are_necessary">Positive visions are necessary</a>)</p>
<h1>Creative process</h1>
<ol>
<li>Prepare</li>
<li>Be fortunate while slacking</li>
<li>Synthesize</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Inspiration from real life</strong>. Writers and poets are often inspired by important events in their life. Usually suffering. Artists often take copious cut outs of visuals they find in the world. Scientists have a less direct connection from experiences. But early experiences often drive people into the field. Maybe they aren’t athletic. Or naturally gravitate towards books. More specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planck, Heisenberg, driven by a sense of awe from exposure to the outdoors and tall peaks and night sky.</li>
<li>Linus Pauling inspired by his father's pharmacy combining two substances into a totally new one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Presented vs. discovered problems</strong>. This is a great framework, which is very similar to <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Hill_climbing_vs_hill_finding">Hill climbing vs hill finding</a>. Many creative people discover problems, and this requires a certain amount of slack.</p>
<p><strong>The need for slack</strong>: why do we need slack at all? It seems that Many creative people tend to sleep on a problem, or take a long break between hard bouts of work, or favoring silent walks and drives to work, or going for a run to take a break… and that is when the insight comes. Something happens when the mind is given a chance to rest. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Resilient_systems_need_slack">Resilient systems need slack</a>.</p>
<p>(Note to self: I don’t do this enough. I’m always listening to something in my downtime. I should enjoy more quiet walks.)</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Maybe it's the same thing that happens when you sleep? Sleep cements connections that matter, and cleans up others that don't (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Sleep_has_a_profound_effect_on_memory_and_learning">Sleep has a profound effect on memory and learning</a>)</p>
<p>So much creativity comes from combining ideas from different domains. Even the electronic fuel controllers for jet engines invented by Frank Offner came from synthesizing ideas from cybernetics with physics!</p>
<h1>Flow</h1>
<p>Csikszentimihalyi is most famous for his book called Flow, and it's woven into this book, but feels a bit out of place (full list <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Csikszentimihalyi's_flow">Csikszentimihalyi's flow</a> for reference).</p>
<p>The secret to life is to experience flow from as many things as possible. Then everything you do will be worth doing for its own sake. Conditions of flow are often met in games. Related to the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Game_mindfulness_—_detect_games_around_you">Game mindfulness — detect games around you</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Internalize the field</strong> Key ability: internalize the field to have a good sense for what the field will accept and what they will not. Have a lot of ideas and then critically have a good razor for separating those that are good from those that are not.</p>
<h1>Creativity and place</h1>
<p>People love going to nice places to do creative stuff. Aspen conference is at a world class resort. Salk institute is right on the beach. There is no evidence for or against physical beauty helping creativity, largely because there is no way to make such an RCT study happen.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity and walking</strong>. Perhaps a prepared mind will be more effective in a beautiful setting? Very speculative. Part of the benefit of walking is that your mind is focused on the surroundings, introducing more distraction. It adds slack. (I should do regular walking 1:1s with my in-person reports.)</p>
<p><strong>A space to be creative</strong>. Key for creativity: a special placed tailored to your needs, a place are comfortable and you are fully in control. (My house is desperately missing this.) Kenneth Golding worked from a cabin overlooking Rockies and used the hot tub regularly. Jonas Salk worked in a studio with a piano and an easel. Living a life of personal creativity seems like a worthy goal.</p>
<h1>New domains across disciplines</h1>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/True_creativity_unlocks_whole_new_fields">True creativity unlocks whole new fields</a></p>
<h1>Meandering paths</h1>
<p>Many creative people take a very indirect path to get to their ultimate destination. This is the thesis of Range as well.</p>
<p>Michael Snow, a famous Canadian artist, musician and composer is an example of someone that takes insights from one domain and applies them to others. He has touched film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music, a shocking breadth.</p>
<p>Ilya Romanovich <strong>Prigogine</strong> had a deep interest in music, art, and philosophy but was convinced to become a lawyer by his parents. So he studied law but wasn’t satisfied with its mechanistic applications. So he began studying the psychology and then neurochemistry of why people commit crimes. Finding this was too ambitious of a scope he refocused on the neurochemistry of cells. This led him to disapprove systems and his Nobel prize. What a polymath, dang. I'm only more impressed by the man. (See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Dissapative_far_from_equilibrium_systems">Dissapative far from equilibrium systems</a>).</p>
<h1>Developing creativity</h1>
<p>Stories of early precocity are often confirmatory. A sense of inner consistency demands that people who have achieved greatness should have done it from an early age. But in practice, it’s hard to predict if someone will become creative at a young age. One consistent pattern: curiosity and deep interests as young children.</p>
<p>In many cases parents play a key role. Treat your kid like a peer, an adult and don't talk to them.</p>
<p>Expose your kid to the vast variety of life at an early age. This is a key role of any good parent. This includes sports, arts, music, sciences, mathematics, travel, literature, etc. (Rhymes a lot with <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Give_kids_a_sampling_period">Give kids a sampling period</a>)</p>
<p><strong>School</strong>: The effect of school is generally pretty negative or neutral. Not generally something that is recalled. But a teachers influence is often significant. They often push a gifted student towards their interests and at a level that exceeds that of the rest of the class. But not too hard so as to keep them interested. (I should focus on the teachers at our kids school as opposed to the school itself. How can I quickly evaluate them given the parent teacher limited time?) That said many great creative people didn’t have a specific teacher-muse they cited.</p>
<p><strong>The Teenage Years Suck</strong>: most creatives tend not to be too popular because they are engrossed with their interests. They might not be as sexually active and tend to spend more time “in the nest”. In most cases the peer group is not intellectual. Nobody in the group recalls teenage years fondly.</p>
<p><strong>Luck</strong>. World War II enabled many women to enter hard sciences because the men usually occupying the seats were all away fighting in the war.</p>
<p><strong>Stable family life</strong>. Also extremely important and common among creative people. Pauling's politically incorrect advice: find a wife that will just take care of all of the home life for you.</p>
<p><strong>Creative aging?</strong> Surprisingly many people interviewed had a pretty steady output from 30 onward. Some people peak towards end of life. Frank Lloyd Wright architected the Guggenheim at 70! (This does strike me as a bit self serving: firstly, the author is himself not young.)</p>
<p><strong>Crystallized intelligence</strong>: A decline in energy is common with age, but skills continue to get honed even at old age. You can sometimes think sharper and faster as a result of what the author calls "crystallized intelligence". Discipline and attitude also improves over age. Seasoned creative subjects had already achieved greatness, and so many experienced less pressure, and could be more trustful of their instincts.</p>
<p>One big challenge I resonate with is to find time to keep doing the core work, since people tend to accumulate administrative responsibilities with age.</p>
<h1>How to be more personally creative</h1>
<p>The narrative devolves into a case study and then closes as a self help book. Becoming Creative is tricky and dependent on many factors like match quality, and buy-in from your field. But you can reliably become more Personally Creative, which according to Mihaly is intrinsically fulfilling.</p>
<p>Specific advice for cultivating curiosity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to <strong>be surprised every day</strong>. Stop and look at the new car. Try a new dish. Actually listen to your colleague for a  Life is nothing but a stream of experiences. The more widely and deeply you swim in it, the richer it will be.</li>
<li>Try to <strong>surprise at least one person every day</strong>. Express an opinion you wouldn’t normally reveal. Ask a question you’d not normally ask. Break your routine: invite someone to a show! Experiment with your appearance. (Feels a bit edge lord)</li>
<li>Write down what surprised you and your most surprising action each evening. Review your notes weekly. (I think this is generic advice for keeping notes and in general I’m very much in favor.)</li>
<li>Follow sparks of interest broadly. Be open to learning. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Follow_your_interests">Follow your interests</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Self help continues. Try a randomly sampled diary to see what you enjoy and what you don’t enjoy. Do more things you enjoy and fewer things you don’t enjoy. (At this point the advice becomes a bit farcical, and I can't help but wonder if reading a book about how to become more creative is a bit like reading a book about how to get better at your tennis serve. My point is that creativity feels very tacit and requiring praxis.)</p>
<p>Anyway I think his framing of personality change is somewhat unattractive. For me the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Strength_is_a_skill">Strength is a skill</a> framing is generative here. It’s better to think of these things as skills than tweaks to one’s personality. Here are 3 in particular:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn to foster traits that are complimentary to your main mode. If introverted, see what it’s like to be extroverted. What are the pros and cons of each? What feels good about it? What scares you about it? Again, <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Out_of_Character_game">Out of Character game</a> is a great way to deliberately practice this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially important for creativity is the ability to switch between convergent and divergent modes of thinking. See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Diverge_and_converge_modes_of_thinking">Diverge and converge modes of thinking</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aim for complexity. Too much integration means you are a caricature of yourself; easily predicted and one dimensional. Too simple. Too much differentiation means too end up being just a random assortment of unrelated ideas. Too chaotic. See <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Cynefin_framework">Cynefin framework</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Interesting tidbit on relationships: it’s important to be able to shift moment by moment from our own viewpoint to that of another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can see depth only because looking with two eyes give us slightly different perspectives. How much deeper can we see when instead of two eyes we rely on four?</p>

    <title>The End of Eternity by Isaac Asimov</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Truly masterful, this book. The way Harlan wants to control Noys mirrors perfectly the way the Eternals want to control reality. Just like Harlan takes her for himself by transporting her to the 100,000th century,</p>
<p>Asimov's views are super complex. Much more complex than the one dimensional technologist I tend to associate with him. Maybe he has suffered more than I thought in light of his habits as a womanizer. But he has many interesting takes, and Noys is not nearly as simple as she initially seems, and is revealed to be the one in charge. Asimov does espouse a certain inevitability of progress. Though mathematician's names change as a result of Reality changes, the nature of math doesn’t. And it all appears to move in lockstep. And he does initially seem like he believes that humans are bound to kill ourselves unless subjected to some kind paternalism. At the end, it's a much more complex and interesting take on both progress and women.</p>
<p>I initially found a certain lack of imagination on Asimov's part when Harlan is described traveling between centuries. Surely the vast timespan would yield a far greater variety of interesting societies than those found in the book? Like the cultural mores and the living conditions feel a bit too cyclical and predictable. This is partly explained by the mass duplicator though, a nice touch! Even more impressively, this is explained when the whole thrust of the book is explained: Reality over all Time is made safe and homogenous by the Allwhen Council's interventions.</p>
<p>I love how precarious Reality feels in the book. I feel a similar precarity in our own reality today. We are just a hair away from collapse, and we keep squeaking by. Why? Perhaps the Eternals are watching…</p>
<h1>World building</h1>
<p>Asimov invented a compelling and original concept to tackle time travel.</p>
<p>There is our regular flow of time: Time, Reality. And in parallel, there is Eternity, which lets Eternals travel to any Time in Reality and return back to Eternity using a device hilariously called a Kettle.</p>
<p>The top Eternal brass sits in the Allwhen Council. This council consists of Computers, who back in 1955 when the book was written, were people that did math. They make mathematical models of Reality, and intervene in it to prevent societal collapse. They aim for changing as little as possible, while averting calamity and keeping humanity on the right track throughout the ages. In their technical lingo, they make the Minimal Necessary Change (MNC) to achieve the Maximal Desired Response (MDR). Cute!</p>
<p>Eternals still age on their own timeline, in "physioyears". It’s just that Eternity is completely disconnected from the specific year in Time you happen have been born in. They are carefully selected for and plucked from Reality at a young age, swearing a solemn vow to leave their old life behind. They are supposed to be perfect beings, but in practice are extremely flawed individuals.</p>
<p>Eternals also facilitate trade between centuries in Reality. This becomes especially interesting when one century wants a cancer curing drug from another century. The fact that all of these cancer patients would no longer die poses big problems for the eternals. Such a huge change could not be permitted by the Allwhen Council.</p>
<p>Any interactions with Reality is precarious. Eternals are careful to avoid making accidental changes. A change typically has high impact on subsequent centuries, but its impact reduces the further into the future you go.</p>
<h1>Live-streamed impressions</h1>
<p>As I read this book, I took notes describing where I expected the story would go. I was wrong every time. Obviously, spoilers abound, but you knew that already. Here are some such notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looks like the protagonist Andrew just got a girl Noys pregnant though… this’ll be fun</li>
<li>Interesting… it seems to have turned even more radically. The one MNC that the protagonist found himself involved in caused his beloved Noys to disappear completely.</li>
<li>At this point I’m convinced that Finge is just testing the protagonist to see if he has what it takes to graduate to the next level.</li>
<li>No— another twist. (It’s fascinating to record my own reaction to the book as I read it). Apparently Finge is merely pointing out a flaw in Noys' matriarchal society, which believes that Eternals live forever and so seduces Harlan in a calculated way. (Is Finge really motivated to annoy Harlan or is he driven by his own job? I suspect the latter and Harlan is just immature.)</li>
<li>Does Asimov see the problem with leaving Noys thousands of centuries in the future all alone? Seems extremely lonely, although I guess Harlan’s visits can be arbitrarily frequent? Or can they if she’s in eternity? Do they share the same physiological time since they are both in eternity?</li>
<li>After travel is blocked beyond the 100,000 century. Why is Harlan so convinced of his importance? Is it an immature petulance and overconfidence? What secret weapon does he hide that he could use against the Council of Allwhen?</li>
<li>Nice — so it’s not just petulance. Instead Harlan has been thinking behind the scenes of the book. He deduced (in a twist) that Eternity would be impossible as described by the historical events of the chronicle. Because of his familiarity with “primitive history” he found The math required to understand time travel in the 24th century was unavailable until the 27th. And Harlan’s role is to coach a pupil who will in fact travel to the 24th to create this “original sin” of time travel.</li>
<li>Asimov's broadly concerned for continued human existence. We are bound to kill ourselves unless subjected to some kind paternalism. Every time we invent nuclear weapons…</li>
<li>Onto these “hidden centuries” in the distant future where there is only eternity and no Reality. What’s that about? It’s hinted at at the start but hardly at all until this “limbo” state that Harlan and Twissel end up in. And why are they alone for days? Where did everyone else go?</li>
<li>I didn’t have a great guess as to why Harlan is unable to travel past the 100,000th century, but Twissel did. He speculated that Eternity actively prevents human evolution, because the Eternals make sure that nothing goes wrong. But what does it mean for something to “go wrong”? And so the Eternals are just conservative and insist on nothing ever changing. This is why Twissel from the 30,000th century is nearly identical to Harlan from the 95th. Eternity stopped evolution.</li>
<li>And so, with this in mind, Twissel speculates that future humans from the hidden centuries deliberately thwarted Eternity’s meddling with them so that the natural order of things can be resumed. But is this speculation? There appears to be no barrier anymore!</li>
<li>Harlan’s tantrum when he feels like he was turned into a marionette by some mysterious force that blocked him from traveling back into the 100,000th centuries to see Noys is a great piece of drama. He is so blind to his own shortcomings!</li>
<li>Wow man, this book is so insanely full of twists. Now it is Noys who is the post-Eternal that was actually pulling all the strings? She was the one that setup Finge and Harlan and Twissel and played them off one another? I looked back in the book even, and it’s true: she did stop the kettle at the exactly 111,394, very subtly.</li>
<li>Noys' explanation is an interesting one and ties to another mysterious previously mentioned in the novel: that of space faring. The fact that Eternity had such a skeptical attitude to space faring and actively prevented humans from engaging in it, led to a situation where humanity was earthbound, while other intelligent beings were colonizing our galaxy. As a result, people were capable of space travel, but stuck on a prison planet (a dim vision - seems like a stretch). Asimov indirectly argues for the intrinsic benefit of humanity eventually becoming a multi-planetary civilization.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Time travel is hard</h1>
<p>I was almost thrilled that this was a time travel story without paradox. But of course it’s not! For example this business with an infinite time loop of Cooper/Mallahsohn needing to travel from the future to 2317 is completely problematic! If this indeed happens a bunch of times, would it happen an infinite number of times? And what if there’s any deviation any of those times? The whole thing is too unstable.</p>
<p>Fascinating solution to the paradox problem of seeing yourself in reality: if this event happens you trigger an automatic change to prevent it from ever happening. So it can never be you that you see in reality. Kind of a clean solution, but definitely suffers from all of the known issues with time travel.</p>
<h1>Connections</h1>
<p>I see a lot of echoes of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Greatness_Cannot_Be_Planned">Greatness Cannot Be Planned</a> and overall Eternity follows <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_Authoritarian_High-Modernist_Recipe_for_Failure">The Authoritarian High-Modernist Recipe for Failure</a>. The ultimate failure of Eternity is the usual: a group of flawed humans making centralized decisions about the future on behalf of all of humanity. In fact, at one point, in conversation with Harlan, Twissel reveals his complete ignorance of markets. This is even more pronounced in the 1987 Soviet rendition of the book, in which the Allwhen Council is transparently portrayed as a group of stooges sitting at the Supreme Soviet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noys said: In ironing out the disasters of Reality, Eternity rules out the triumphs as well. It is in meeting the great tests that mankind can most successfully rise to great heights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Harlan woodenly replies “The greatest good for the greatest…”, a great illustration of some limitations of utilitarianism.</p>
<p>The end is a bit rushed and marred with overly complex time loops, but overall a great work!</p>

    <title>Genesis by ✨ translated by Robert Alter</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/genesis-by-translated-by-robert-alter"/>
    
    <updated>2022-05-01T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/genesis-by-translated-by-robert-alter</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Genesis is not so much a book, but an “accretion of sundry traditions, shot through with disjunctions and contradictions, and accumulated in an uneven editorial process over several centuries”. The Hebrew word for book, “Sefer” actually translates more to scroll than to book, and scrolls are much more fungible than books. A scroll can be stitched to another scroll, split, and spliced, and rarely has named attribution. Not a coherent artwork by a single author, Genesis is more like a cathedral of medieval Europe, the product of many hands, involving an elaborate process of editing, like the greatest Hollywood films.</p>
<p>Main sources of compilation include {Y/J}ahwist (J), Elohistic (E), and Priestly (P) source documents. J and E might be contemporary and early, P dates to about 6th century BCE. But all is hotly debated.</p>
<p>The translator lambastes his contemporary commentators for being too focused on the sourcing and not sufficiently focused on analyzing the material itself, while refining medieval commentators like Rashi &amp; Abraham bin Ezra.</p>
<p>Genesis split into primeval history (1-11) and a focus on the past, how this all came to be, told in a formal, repetitive way. Bulk of the book is patriarchal tales (12-50) which is focused on the future, promising long-term national greatness etc. Here the style changes, becomes much more concerned with human affairs, emotions, feuds, violence, and constant struggle.</p>
<p>The narrative arc is really clean: “Genesis begins with the making heaven and earth and all life, and ends with the image of a mummy — Joseph’s — in a coffin.”</p>
<hr />
<h1>Themes and surprises</h1>
<p><strong>Nomads vs. farmers</strong>: The story of Cain and Abel is about the superiority of the noble nomadic herdsmen (Abel) over the terrible and evil sedentary farmers (Cain). Echoes of this later “for every shepherd is abhorrent to Egypt” (46:34)</p>
<p><strong>Displacement of the firstborn</strong> Cain and Abel is also the start of the theme of how the firstborn often gets screwed, despite their birth order. Similar story with Esau and Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>Not children of Cain</strong>: I wrongly thought that humans were descended from Cain. No — Cain and Abel had a third brother, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>Antediluvian ages</strong>: Methuselah, known for his long life, was 969 years old, but that is only moderately impressive in the grand scheme of things. Adam died at the ripe old age of 930, his son Seth at 912. Cain died young at 730.</p>
<p><strong>Magical beings</strong>: What the heck are the Nephilim (6:1)?</p>
<p><strong>Sexual mystery</strong>: What is it that Canaan actually did to his grandfather Noah when he became drunk? (9:20)</p>
<p><strong>Abram's military conquest</strong>: Chedorlaomer, king of Elam (what a name!) abducted Lot and his crew, and Abram had to raise an army of 318 people and wage war to bail him out!</p>
<p><strong>Abram's ritual</strong>: in 15:15, Abram cleaves his farm animals in twain, leaves the halves in some sort of bizarre ritual. He then falls into a deep slumber. He wards off carrion birds, and sees smoke and fire. No drugs involved?</p>
<p><strong>Ishmael's short stick</strong>: Shockingly disparaging of Ishmael "He shall be a wild ass of a man; His hand against everyone, And everyone’s hand against him"</p>
<p><strong>Barely monotheism:</strong> El Elyon, El-Roi, El Shaddai, God Most High. There are so many different Semitic gods fused into one here. Sometimes god is referred to Elohim (literally "gods" — plural). Jewish Monotheism is clearly only just emerging in these passages.</p>
<p><strong>Surrogate slave mothers</strong>: Ishmael was born to Abraham from Hagar (Sarah's servant). And only two of Jacob's children were born to him from Rebeca.</p>
<p><strong>Lot and his daughters</strong>: Lot unambiguously offered up his own virgin daughters to be raped in the angels’ stead (19:7). Later, he and his virgin daughters settled in a cave, and then had children via their own father (19:31). Deeply disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>Hands and thighs</strong>: apparently cupping someone else's genitals or at least putting your hand near there is part of the act of solemn oath taking in ancient societies (24:2). This also happens when Jacob asks Joseph to bury him with the other patriarchs (47:29).</p>
<p><strong>Apocryphal camels</strong>: The translator suggests that camels in the bible are not actually historical. Archaeological evidence suggests that they weren’t adapted to the climate until several centuries after the patriarchal period.</p>
<p><strong>Named wells:</strong> Water is extremely important in the desert. Water rights are key, and Abraham battles Abimelech over this (21:22). Wells are so important, the wells have names (26:17)</p>
<p><strong>Wells and betrothals</strong>: Abraham's servant meets Rebekah (betrothed to Isaac) at a well (24:14). Later, Jacob meets Rachel at a well (29:10). In Exodus Moses meets Zipporah in the same manner.</p>
<p><strong>Laban is a real slimeball</strong>: Such a greedy dude, obsessed with jewlery (24:30), and then tricks Jacob into working him for 14 years. And still Jacob was unable to take his harem (2 wives, 2 slave girls, 9 children) without asking Laban’s permission (30:29). Quite the scene with Laban furious over his stolen idol, in which Jacob inadvertently condemns his beloved to death (31:32), followed by another gem, in which Rachel sits on a cushion concealing the stolen figurine and pleading to her father that she has menses and cannot get up. (31:35).</p>
<p><strong>Girl names</strong>: anyone looking for a biblical name for their baby girl? I recommend Oholibamah. There is also Basemath, although I guess it’s pronounced bass-seh-mat. Or consider Mehetabel.</p>
<p><strong>Boy names</strong>: highly recommend naming them like Benjamin did. And he had a lot of kids: Bella and Beecher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, <strong>Muppim and Huppim</strong> and Ard.</p>
<p><strong>Juda* the traitor</strong>: Judah sells his brother (37:20), and Judas sells his brother Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Tamar and Judah</strong>: Tamar is I guess fixated on getting a son by Judah’s lineage (Er) one way or another, so in desperation dresses like a whore and seduces Judah. Is it normal for Judah to go whoring? (38:16)</p>
<p><strong>Joseph the autist</strong>: “And look” is Joseph’s signature childish excitement. He seems to have no ability to read the room. No wonder his brothers hated him so much! (41:1)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob and Joseph were embalmed</strong>: Jacob was embalmed (50:3), and Joseph was even mummified and placed in a coffin (50:26). Surprisingly Egyptian for a forefather.</p>

    <title>Ministry for the Future</title>

      <div>
        <p>The Ministry for the Future opens with an emotional and memorable vignette. Frank, an American doctor on a mission to Rajasthan, finds himself in the middle of a monstrous heatwave. Wet bulb temperatures reach a point that is no longer survivable by humans. He and many others try to seek shelter in a lake, but it is warmer than the air. Thousands die, but he miraculously survives. Frank is emotionally scarred for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>After the strong opening, Ministry veers away from its narrative roots. A nominal plot remains, but is secondary to the author’s intent. Instead KSR takes the reader on a tour of various contemporary considerations to do with climate change. He talks about high wet bulb temperatures leading to hyperthermia, discusses the limitations of the GDP as a metric for measuring progress, accuses the unwashed masses of voting against their self interests (a pet peeve of mine, see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Voting_against_narrow_self-interests_in_post-scarcity">Voting against narrow self-interests in post-scarcity</a>). KSR reminds us about Jevon’s paradox, and posits that wealthier people are less happy than their poorer peers. He even goes on weird tangents that never get resolved, like the one about <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Lamed-Vav_Tzadikim">Lamed-Vav Tzadikim</a>.</p>
<p>Ministry is a fine introduction to climate adjacent issues in a more digestible form. But I found the bait-and-switch aspect downright annoying. I sought a novel (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Power_of_Fiction">Power of Fiction</a>), but instead found a series of didactic asides.</p>

    <title>Grand Transitions by Vaclav Smil</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/grand-transitions-by-vaclav-smil"/>
    
    <updated>2022-04-08T09:00:00-00:00</updated>
    
    <id>https://smus.com/books/grand-transitions-by-vaclav-smil</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Up front approach is interesting. Having worked with Jay Forester at MIT on early modeling, Smil is not a big believer in models.</p>
<p>Instead of simple models Smil takes a more contingent, event based approach to the topic. Some things progress in an evolutionary way. But others are dependent on human action and sudden unexpected discontinuities. Even the title “Grand Transitions” harkens to a punctuated equilibrium view of progress.</p>
<p>Smil alludes to the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Expected_vs_unexpected_inventions">Expected vs unexpected inventions</a> framing I first heard from Clarke (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Profiles_of_the_Future_by_Arthur_Clarke">Profiles of the Future by Arthur Clarke</a>). He thinks that information scaling inventions like the printing press and the internet tend are especially likely to have unexpected consequences and break existing models.</p>
<h1>S curves everywhere</h1>
<p>Reminiscent of Perez in her <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Installation_vs_deployment_phases_of_innovation_(Carlotta_Perez)">Installation vs deployment phases of innovation (Carlotta Perez)</a>, Smil sees S-curves everywhere and warns about over-extrapolating exponential growth. Reminds me that <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Forecasting_s-curves_is hard">Forecasting s-curves is hard</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Human ➡ animal ➡ machine power</strong>: draft horses peak in 1910 at 20 million draft horses in the US and are then obsoleted by mechanical tractors, but this transition takes decades. As they grow, populations of draft horses and tractors form S curves:</p>
<p><strong>Transatlantic travel</strong> only became possible in the 15th century. Then sailing frigates took about a month to cross. Steam powered ships that would eventually take an order of magnitude less time (Lucitania in 4 days). This transition took a century around 1830-1930. Then the transition to jet air travel, yielded a further reduction of 1.5 orders of magnitude (5h). This was a much faster transition of just a decade or so in the 1950s.</p>
<p>But not all “epochal transitions” pan out as S-curves. Some exponential growth turns out to be a false start in retrospect.</p>
<p><strong>Early electric cars</strong> were the first and most promising ground transport in the late 19th century. The first car to reach 100 km/h was electric. Edison bet big on them but gas internal combustion won instead. Smil doesn’t elaborate as to why but I suspect energy density has a big role to play (more on this later). It isn’t until now that the epochal transition to EVs is underway. But predictions are such that we won’t have majority electric on the roads until at least 2040.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear energy generation</strong> is another example of a false start that looks even more bleak. Peaking at 17% of global energy output, current projections are just 4% of global energy by 2040. Culprits appear to be going over budget and safety. Also see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Nuclear_power_is_hampered_by_regulation_(ALARA)">Nuclear power is hampered by regulation (ALARA)</a>.</p>
<h1>Demographic transitions</h1>
<p>The developed world is characterized by a shift in equilibrium from high fertility and high mortality to a new one, balancing low fertility and low mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic dividend</strong> refers to the benefit a polity experiences when the majority of its citizens are of working age. The ratio of working population (20-65) to their dependents (young and old) is an interesting metric to track. A society with high mortality and high fertility has an young average age, and many young dependents. As mortality and fertility decrease, the average citizen is of working age and the society reaches a stage of development that pays a high demographic dividend because many workers support few dependents. In next equilibrium, the average population becomes old and once again there are many dependents.</p>
<p><strong>Median ages vary hugely per country</strong>. The Japanese median age is 47.3, while the Guatemalan median age is 22.1. The demographic dividend will be greatly advantageous to young countries (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age">chart</a>).</p>
<p>Smil is pretty pessimistic about lifespan extension because he sees it as an S-curve that tapers out at around 80 years old. Increased societal longevity should definitely come with an older retirement age!</p>
<p>Japan leads the way here and is projected to be depopulating at a huge rate. 120 M now. 100 M by 2050. 88 M stable state. Villages are shrinking.</p>
<p><strong>Urban vs rural footprints</strong>: Smil criticizes cities for being terrible polluters. This directly contradicts the common wisdom that cities and dense living is far more efficient per-capita. Isn’t it actually quite good to be in a city because of the benefits of proximity?</p>
<p>Smil's argument is that cities are actually worse per capita from an environment perspective. A villager that moves to town may have been used to one light per room but now has a bigger TV. Another urban downside is that heat islands are 3-8 degrees higher in cities.</p>
<p>Which one is right?</p>
<p><strong>Humans win mammal population density</strong>: 50k humans / square km density in parts of Manila is equivalent to 2kg of human biomass per square m. This is than for any mammal.</p>
<h1>Economic transitions</h1>
<p>Although agriculture is only 0.7% of the GDP, it is underrated: “Let those economists live off the main sector of GDP: financial services,” quips Smil.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture improvements</strong>: Huge yield gains. Lots of automation in food production, clear when you consider output in terms of time per weight of output. (Interesting idea: use agriculture as a terminus for <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Asimov's_Tech_Tree">Asimov's Tech Tree</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>1800: 7 minutes per kilogram of wheat. Tools: two oxen, a wood plow, brush harrows, sickles to cut, flails to thresh.</li>
<li>1900: 25 seconds per kilogram of wheat, an 18x improvement. heavy horses, a steel gang plow led by a team, iron tooth harrows, seed drill, horse drawn combine for harvesting and threshing.</li>
<li>2000: 6 seconds per kilogram, a 4x improvement. Large tractors are equivalent to 500 horses, high capacity combines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Farming trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specialization: 5 crops per farm in 1900 -&gt; 1.1 crops per farm in 2000.</li>
<li>Centralization: fewer but larger farms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy subsidies</strong>: Modern agriculture requires a lot of additional energy beyond just the natural sunlight, in the form of fertilizer, irrigation, fuel for farm equipment. 4% of global energy goes to these energy subsidies. Without them, we couldn’t feed the current population of 7.5B.</p>
<p><strong>Animals are especially energy-intensive</strong>: Based on this line of thinking, animals cost a lot more based on just the energy required to produce the feed. Animals also require structures and maintenance of those structures. And there are additional costs around transportation.</p>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/History_of_crop_rotation_technology">History of crop rotation technology</a></p>
<p><strong>Fertilizers and side effects</strong>: Guano was used as early fertilizer. By 1824, there was an active Peruvian import business. Nitrate was the first inorganic fertilizer. Use of Fertilizers meant crops grow better and are more attractive to pests. Thus, insecticides.</p>
<p><strong>Feeding draft animals</strong>: There is a complex relationship between draft animals, and the feed they require which detracts from crop yields. More than half of all food production is animal feed (!). Smil suggests that animals could be far more sustainable if they were allowed to graze naturally.</p>
<p>(There's a nice opportunity to explain these things using feedback loops, along the lines of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Horses,_peasant_mobility_and_urbanization">Horses, peasant mobility and urbanization</a>. Just like in the middle ages, draft animals and farm mobility in general cuts across all these aspects: planting, harvesting with combines, and transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Animal mass to feed ratios</strong>: A metric to measure the efficiency of animal protein production. Input is weight of feed, output is the animal weight that can be consumed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chickens: 3:1 (3 kg and feed produces 1 kg of chicken)</li>
<li>Pork: 9:1</li>
<li>Beef: 25:1</li>
</ul>
<p>For aquaculture it’s 3:1 but varies with species. For example, it's 1.8 for farmed Atlantic Salmon.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary patterns</strong>: Two major attractors for dietary patterns as societies become more affluent.</p>
<ol>
<li>Western-style 3200 kcal per day and 30% of calories from animal products.</li>
<li>Mediterranean/Asian style has fewer calories per day (2400 kcal) and less reliance on animal products.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remarkable stats in Japan. Rice intake (by weight) went from 60-70 percent in 1950 to just 20% today. Now the Japanese diet is more dairy than rice (by calories) and this shift in just 50 years post WW2.</p>
<p>Smil is genuinely impressed with the long way we’ve come on ending malnutrition and famines, though a combination of increased farming efficiency and science (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/List_of_micronutrients_and_deficiencies_in_humans">List of micronutrients and deficiencies in humans</a>). But he's miffed that this truly amazing story gets so little airtime in terms of “great innovations to celebrate” compared to smartphones and Steve Jobs and as he disparagingly puts it “putting new cardboard on electronics manufactured in China”.</p>
<p>This reminds me a lot of this idea from <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/What_can_a_technologist_do_to_accelerate_electrification">What can a technologist do to accelerate electrification</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inconveniences of daily life are not the significant problems. The world that scrolls past you on Twitter is not the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Energy transitions</h1>
<p>The usual energy progression is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wood</li>
<li>Coal</li>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Gas</li>
</ol>
<p>Smil tracks the dates at which each country transitioned from mostly X to mostly Y. Transition years vary widely by country. England moved to coal very early and this catalyzed the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Some countries and regions skipped whole steps, for example going straight from wood burning to oil and never ramping up and coal industry, or jumping directly to hydroelectricity.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong>: There's an impressive increase in shipping container payload: from 100 twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) in 1950 to 23,000 TEU in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Kerosene vs. diesel vs. gasoline, etc</strong>: Oil (aka Petroleum) is generally found as a yellowish-brown liquid in geological formations. It can then be refined into a variety of fuels. Kerosene (aka paraffin) is the basis for airplane fuel. Diesel fuel has many applications from small engines powering a private car to large marine engines. There are many other kinds of petroleum based fuel types, including Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) which powers some of the largest container ships.</p>
<p><strong>Air travel</strong>: Kilometers traveled per passenger is a useful metric for quantifying air travel. It's hard to predict where this S-curve will level out.</p>
<p><strong>Horses vs oxen</strong>: Smil estimate of horse power vs ox power is surprising. 7x human for horse and only 2.5x human for ox?! This is surprising, since I read elsewhere (<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Medieval_Technology_and_Social_Change_by_Lynn_White">Medieval Technology and Social Change by Lynn White</a>) that horses were quite weak compared to oxen, although this was before selective breeding made them stronger, and before horse collars.</p>
<p><strong>Power-to-weight ratios</strong>: Turbofans have the highest watts per kg density of any machine. (How does my e-foil motor compare? Back of napkin calculation the 65161 has max output 6 kW and weight 3 kg.)</p>
<p><strong>Electricity is amazing</strong>: Smil writes a real ode to electricity. It's a marvel that powers all of modernity: lossless to deliver from station to home. Completely silent and non polluting at conversion point. Safe. Easy to convert to motion heat and light. The world saw extremely rapid electrification of urban and rural households. From start to finish, the S-curve took only 75 years. Energy transitions take decades, even if highly desirable.</p>
<p><strong>Lumens per watt</strong>: A metric for measuring light efficiency. Incandescent to CFL to LED. It's plummeted over the last two centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking range transitions</strong>: early ranges were electric, then switched to gas and are now returning to electric induction stoves. Has this transition happened?</p>
<p><strong>So many air conditioners</strong>: Wild that us a conditioner penetration is 95% in the US. I double checked this, Google says 90%.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency in transport</strong>: Not covered directly but I wondered how to compare various modes of transportation. The result is my note on <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Efficiency_of_transportation_modes">Efficiency of transportation modes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency gains without drastic changes</strong>: We tend to underrate  and under report incremental improvements as key components of an invention. The first steam engine in the 18th century had a 1% efficiency. Watt's improvements doubled it to just 2%. But then subsequent unnamed inventions made efficiency rise to 8%.</p>
<p>Modern gasoline engines are substantially more efficient (usually 30-35% efficiency). Diesel is a bit better, around 45% efficient.</p>
<h1>Economic transitions</h1>
<p>There is no clear marker for completed economic transition. For demographics, the transition happens when the birth rate plummeted below replacement. For energy, a transition happened when a country fully switches from plant based fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Growth is slowing</strong>: Also, GDP over time curves appear as S curves with inflection points in the recent past for most developed countries. This means growth is slowing. However, it's unclear if this GDP stat can be trusted.</p>
<p>One economic transition model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Primary markets: focus on raw materials.</li>
<li>Secondary markets: focus on refining the materials, creating goods from them.</li>
<li>Tertiary markets: everything else that meets consumer demands. Includes services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Primitive societies are heavily skewed towards primary markets. As societies progress, they tend to shift to tertiary markets, focusing on services. Here's the graph for the US:</p>
<p>Another economic transition involves more people traveling further. This includes for work commutes as well as travel for leisure. Since 1800, people travel an order of magnitudes more for work than before.</p>
<p><strong>Electronics are surprisingly energy intensive</strong>: Total energy costs to manufacture all electronics (computers, phones etc) was 1 exajoule (EJ). Compared to all cars at 7EJ. This despite the fact that all cars manufactured weigh 100x as much. Why? Partly due to planned obsolescence and rapid improvement of electronics. (I really should strive to <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Buy_it_for_life">Buy it for life</a> with these electronics devices as much as possible. Optimize for longevity. Including my current iPhone. It’s just wasteful otherwise.)</p>
<h1>Climate transitions</h1>
<p>Interesting foray into anthropogenic climate change from pre-modern humans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Impact of runaway fires from cooking accidents</li>
<li>Extinction of mega fauna due to migrating hunters (and climate changes)</li>
<li>Impact of early farming on soil PH and other indicators</li>
<li>Deforestation</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Forest density on ice-free land</strong>: In terms of tree cover, the metric is mainly forests as measured by sufficient tree density on ice free land. So that means you can take a country and divide its total land by total ice-free land by the percentage of that ice-free land that has forest on it. By this metric most developed world countries have increasing tree cover. And furthermore as climate reduces the amount of ice covered land because of warming, this metric will increase further.</p>
<p>Anyway things are looking pretty dicey.</p>
<p>And we have to reduce CO2 impacts pronto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the latest available science, achieving the long-term temperature goal would require global greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2020 and subsequently be reduced to zero before the end of the century. To limit warming to 1.5°C, this reduction to zero must take place around 2050</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Smil doesn't think this future is likely, because there's really no reason to imagine it would be so. We're still increasing the absolute amount of CO2 emissions. The relative ratio of fossil fuels is declining, but the absolute amount of energy generated is increasing. The population is still projected to keep growing to 9 B by 2050. And as countries in Asia and Africa become more prosperous (hopefully), the energy footprints will increase. Per capita, the middle class in America take 500 GJ per year, compared to per capita in the developing world at 20 GJ per year, an order of magnitude less.</p>
<p>(Kinda bored of the environment section, moving on)</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Smil is highly critical of singularity believers like Ray Kurzweil. He’s also critical of “endless progress” narratives like those of Steven Pinker. And those that try to thread the needle between the two like Noah Yuval Harari (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Homo_Deus_by_Yuval_Noah_Harari">Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari</a>).</p>
<p>Instead Smil aligns himself in between techno optimists and systems thinkers with an understanding of natural limits like Meadows (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Thinking_in_Systems_by_Donella_Meadows">Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows</a>).</p>
<p>Rather than make predictions, Smil attempts to give a lower bound on the fastest possible time to make future transitions.</p>
<p>Projections of population are still like 9+ billion for 2050. These projections may be conservative but still likely to be wrong. Even though they are on S curves and not naive projections, S curves are hard to predict (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Forecasting_s-curves_is_hard">Forecasting s-curves is hard</a>). And also, this does not take into account any discontinuous events and black swans.</p>
<p>Random things to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pumping water up-hill as giant battery</strong>: Apparently the efficiency of storage of a large water reservoir that is artificially pumped up is extremely good, an only 25% loss from this, and stores energy extremely well. Far better than any chemical battery could.</li>
<li>Look for energy density comparison (in watts per kg) of batteries versus kerosene for air travel and diesel for large naval engines.</li>
<li>Apparently the energy footprint of wood vs plastic is heavily in favor of wood. What are the implications of that?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collective action problems</strong>: The global dysfunction in the back of global wisdom Homosapien sapiens is a major barrier to reducing climate impact. In general the collective action problem is basically unsolved as we can see in the 21st-century. Related to <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Collective_action_problems_aka_social_dilemmas">Collective action problems aka social dilemmas</a>.</p>
<p>Smil ends with a #2x2:</p>
<pre><code>|            | Simplicity     | Complexity          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Minimalism |                | Smil's prescription |
| Maximalism | High modernism |                     |
</code></pre>
<p>Complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Favor a multitude of approaches rather than relying on a single perfect solution (eg. No magic geo engineering bullet)</li>
<li>No place for a priori ideological purity. No insistence on what is best. Pragmatism (eg. Open to nuclear)</li>
<li>A hyper-focus on electrification may be over doing it (ahem <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Rewiring_America_by_Saul_Griffith">Rewiring America by Saul Griffith</a>). Avoid killing hydrogen vehicles by overtly favoring EVs with excessive rebates and ownership targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Minimalism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systemic small changes can help a lot. Not all fruits need to be available year round. Not all cars need to be SUVs.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Strong world building</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reliable phone-computers designed to last a lifetime</li>
<li>Slow reveal of what the world is like, and what "Post-Transition" means</li>
<li>Vivid descriptions of ruins of modernity ("Factory Age")</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Factory Age ruins looked the same. Hulking towers of boxes, bolts, and tubes. Brutal. Utilitarian. Visually at odds with the thriving flora now laying claim to the rusted corpse.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Tea Monks", basically traveling tea merchant-shrinks. Great concept!</li>
<li>Original pantheon of gods, quite mysterious. Well written slow reveal towards the end segment about the Hermitage.</li>
<li>Loved the robots that have a finite lifespan, but create new robots out of spare parts ("wild-built")</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess you’d say family tree is comprised of many wild-built individuals, descended in total from”—the robot counted on its fingertips—“sixteen factory originals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loved the robot names, and how they are perhaps more closely integrated into nature than humans.</li>
<li>Excellent low tech robot message boards.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Writing and style</h1>
<ul>
<li>Some cringe-worthy writing that reads a bit like fan fiction.</li>
<li>Some overly florid sentences, for example:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sun cascaded through the hole cut in the canopy, creating a bountiful column of light that played pleasingly with the butter-colored paving inlaid with vibrant stones.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prolific use of "they" pronouns which I found awkward. Maybe a matter of habit? It was the first book in which this really stood out to me:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Jules was the first to arrive, as always. Dex smiled to themself as she approached</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Character development a bit weak. Dex seems like an angsty teenager without much depth. Is this young adult writing? I think no, given the prolific cursing towards the end.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Strong ecosystem musings</h1>
<ul>
<li>I'm a bit obsessed by this idea that <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Subsystems_that_integrate_conflict_can_lead_to_resilient_systems">Subsystems that integrate conflict can lead to resilient systems</a>, and this fragment resonated with me:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It must have been such a relief to be free of predators and eat whatever the hell you wanted. But that was the exact opposite of what the ecosystem needed. The ecosystem required the elk to be afraid in order to stay in balance. But elk don’t want to be afraid. Fear is miserable, as is pain. As is hunger. Every animal is hardwired to do absolutely anything to stop those feelings as fast as possible. We’re all just trying to be comfortable, and well fed, and unafraid. It wasn’t the elk’s fault. The elk just wanted to relax.” Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.” “Just like the elk.”</p>

    <title>Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read Collapse of Complex Societies on GB' suggestion. This one was a doozie, and I must say, often over my head for its breadth of references into specific civilizations that I have no background with at all. And Tainter assumes you are either familiar with a broad variety of civilizations in detail, or will do the legwork to get there. As a result, I felt that this book was better suited to an Anthropology/Archaeology professional.</p>
<p>Tainter strives toward a general pattern of collapse, one that applies to all collapses at all times. Very simplified, it goes like this. A civilization grows, becomes more complex, and then crumbles under its own success. Succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of civilisation as a poorly-built ladder. As you climb, each step that you used falls away. A fall from a height of just a few rungs is fine. Yet the higher you climb, the larger the fall. Eventually, once you reach a sufficient height, any drop from the ladder is fatal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-are-we-on-the-road-to-civilisation-collapse</p>
<h1>Tainter's general theory</h1>
<p>In Tainter's words, four concepts lead to understanding collapse, the first three of which are the underpinnings of the fourth. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>human societies are problem-solving organizations</li>
<li>sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance</li>
<li>increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita, and</li>
<li>investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response often reaches a point of <strong>negative</strong> marginal returns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, while initial investment by a society in growing complexity may be a rational solution to perceived needs, that happy state of affairs cannot last. As the least costly extractive, economic, information-processing, and organizational solutions are progressively exhausted, any further need for increased complexity must be met by more costly responses.</p>
<p>Once a complex society enters the stage of declining marginal returns, collapse becomes a mathematical likelihood, requiring only time.</p>
<p>The following diagram is illuminating:</p>
<p>!<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Tainter's_diminishing_marginal_returns_in_complex_societies.png">Tainter's diminishing marginal returns in complex societies.png</a></p>
<p>I am immediately reminded of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Two_Watersheds_-_too_much_institutionalization">Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization</a>, but Tainter's argument is even more macro. The whole of society reaches the second watershed, and then sets itself on track for general collapse.</p>
<h1>Civilization = complexity</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The features that popularly define a civilized society - such as great traditions of art and writing - are epiphenomena or covariables of social, political, and economic complexity. Complexity calls these traditions into being, for such art and literature serve social and economic purposes and classes that exist only in complex settings. Civilization emerges with complexity, exists because of it, and disappears when complexity does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Tainter argues, rising and falling complexity is a monitor for the phenomenon termed civilization.</p>
<h1>States are complex, chiefdoms are simple</h1>
<p>Tainter distinguishes between complex and simple societies. Most societies are complex, and governed by states. Robert Carneiro has estimated that 99.8 percent of human history has been dominated by states.</p>
<p>In contrast, simple societies, governed by chiefdoms are limited by the obligations of kinship and the lack of true coercive force. By the time human organizations emerged that today would be called a state, these limitations had been surpassed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The features that set states apart ... are: territorial organization, differentiation by class and occupation rather than by kinship, monopoly of force, authority to mobilize resources and personnel, and legal jurisdiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tainter sees states as a series of complex systems. Very much along the lines of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Thinking_in_Systems_by_Donella_Meadows">Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complex societies tend to be what Simon has called "nearly decomposable systems". That is, they are at least partly built up of social units that are themselves potentially stable and independent, and indeed at one time may have been so.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>How are states formed? Conflict vs. integration theory</h1>
<p>Tainter fairly accuses the reader of being obsessed by collapse, and insufficiently interested in formation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It cannot be wholly resisted, for collapse may not be understood except in the context of how complex societies function and operate, and that cannot he divorced from the question of how they have come into being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conflict theory</strong> can be traced to Ibn Khaldun (1377). In essence, conflict theory asserts that the state emerged out of the needs and desires of individuals and subgroups of a society. The state, in this view, is based on divided interests, on domination and exploitation, on coercion, and is primarily a stage for power struggles (Lenski 1966: 16-17). More specifically, the governing institutions of the state were developed as coercive mechanisms to resolve intra- societal conflicts arising out of economic stratification (Fried 1967; Haas 1982: 20). The state serves, thus, to maintain the privileged position of a ruling class that is largely based on the exploitation and economic degradation of the masses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conflict theory suffers from a problem of psychological reductionism. That is, the emergence of the state is explained by reference to the wishes, intentions, needs, and/or desires of a small, privileged segment of society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Integration theory</strong> suggests that complexity, stratification, and the state arose, not out of the ambitions of individuals or subgroups, but out of the needs of society. The major elements of this approach are: (a) shared, rather than divided, social interests; (b) common advantages instead of dominance and exploitation; (c) consensus, not coercion; and (d) societies as integrated systems rather than as stages for power struggles (Lenski 1966: 15-17). The governing institutions of the state developed to centralize, coordinate, and direct the disparate parts of complex societies.</p>
<p>Integration theory resonates with me. Specifically this framing as stratification as a necessary evil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The costs of stratification are a necessary evil which must be borne to realize its integrative benefits. In basing the development of complexity on real, observable, physical needs (defense, public works, resource sharing, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also does not preclude that compensation of elites does not always match their contribution to society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is, however, a very important point that conflict and integration theory have in common. In both views, states are problem-solving organizations. Both theories see the state as arising out of changed circumstances,</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Types of collapse</h1>
<p><strong>Partial imperial collapse is common</strong> Tainter identifies a pattern in which an empire doesn't fully collapse, merely loses its colonies and reverts to being a standalone country:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other cases that could be added to this list are the collapses of modern empires (such as the Spanish, French, and British). The demise of these empires clearly represents a retrenchment from a multi-national level of centralized organization that was global in extent. There are, however, differences from the majority of cases just discussed. Most notable is the fact that the loss of empire did not correspondingly entail collapse of the home administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Full imperial collapse is also possible</strong> Tainter describes the terrifying disintegration of Ottoman Turkish authority in 1918:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Allied troops... found a city that was dead. The Turkish government had just ceased to function. The electrical supply had failed and was intermittent. Tramways did not work and abandoned trams littered the roads. There was no railway service, no street cleaning and a police force which had largely become bandit, living on blackmail from citizens in lieu of pay. Corpses lay at street corners and in side lanes, dead horses were everywhere, with no organization to remove them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Institutional collapse</strong> Each civilization may typically contain a number of individual political entities that themselves rise and fall. However the definition of "civilization" tends to be vague and intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural continuity</strong> Even if a civilization collapses, the culture tends to continuity.</p>
<h1>A catalog of other causes of collapse</h1>
<p>Tainter is skeptical about many commonly provided reasons for collapse:</p>
<ol>
<li>Depletion of vital resource</li>
<li>Establishment of a new resource base</li>
<li>Catastrophe</li>
<li>Insufficient response to circumstances</li>
<li>Other complex societies</li>
<li>Intruders</li>
<li>Class conflict, elite misbehavior</li>
<li>Social dysfunction</li>
<li>Mystical factors</li>
<li>Chance events</li>
<li>Economic factors</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these factors help understand collapse as a general phenomenon, applicable to all societies.</p>
<p>Tainter has general critiques of his predecessors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rarely do authors question the logic of the climate proposition: How does or how can climatic fluctuations, invaders, and so forth lead to collapse? Can the postulated cause really account for the outcome? Is the explanation adequate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Resource depletion</strong>: If a society cannot deal with resource depletion (which all societies are to some degree designed to do) then the truly interesting questions revolve around the society, not the resource. What structural, political, ideological, or economic factors in a society prevented an appropriate response?</p>
<p><strong>Elite misbehavior</strong>: To suggest that societies collapse because elites act unwisely explains little. Are there conditions under which elites act wisely or unwisely, or is this a random variable? Is it even a definable and measurable factor?</p>
<h1>Mechanisms for collapse</h1>
<p>Specialization =&gt; Reduction of resiliency</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy of local systems are reduced as specialization increases. As special-purpose subsystems become increasingly differentiated, stability declines. Disruptions occurring anywhere will be spread everywhere, whereas in less complex settings a society would be cushioned against disruptions by less specialization, less interlinkage among parts, and greater time delays between cause and ultimate outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elman Service's <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Law_of_evolutionary_potential">Law of evolutionary potential</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more specialized and adapted a form in a given evolutionary stage, the smaller its potential for passing to the next stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rhymes quite a bit with <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_Great_Filter_solution_to_Fermi's_paradox">The Great Filter solution to Fermi's paradox</a>. Service also writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Successful complex societies become locked into their adaptations, and are easily bypassed by those less specialized. So by having greater flexibility, less complex border states gain an increasing competitive advantage, and are thus able ultimately to topple older, established states</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way of stating the same thing is the <strong>Dinosaur Model</strong>. Here, a complex society is seen as a lumbering colossus, fixed in its morphology, and incapable of rapid change. Locked into an evolutionary dead end, it represents an investment in structure, size, and complexity that is awesome and admirable, yet highly maladaptive. When stresses arise, such a society cannot adapt, and so must expire.</p>
<p>This rhymes very much with <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Disruption_theory">Disruption theory</a> in business. This lock-in phenomenon can also be framed as a feedback loop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other scholars implicate a positive feedback loop in collapse, from which escape is impossible. Colin Renfrew (1979) argues that under stress complex societies lack the option to diversify, to become less specialized. By doing more of what may have caused the problem in the first place, the breakdown of the system is made inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Runaway Train</strong> model may be a variant of the Dinosaur model, but it has its own distinct characteristics. A complex society is seen as impelled along a path of increasing complexity, unable to switch directions, regress, or remain static. When obstacles impinge, it can continue in only the direction it is headed, so that catastrophe ultimately results.</p>
<p>The <strong>House of Cards</strong> model differs from the previous two. It suggests that complex societies, either as a rule or in certain kinds of environments, are inherently fragile, operating on low margins of reserve, so that their collapse is inevitable.</p>
<p>The argument of these laws and models is that all societies, complex or otherwise, run the risk of adapting so well to existing circumstances that change becomes impossible.</p>
<h1>Complexity reduction =&gt; depopulation</h1>
<p>For Tainter, complexity reduction causes depopulation and not vice-versa. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Depopulation_is_often_correlated_with_decline">Depopulation is often correlated with decline</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex society that has collapsed is suddenly smaller, simpler, less stratified, and less socially differentiated. Specialization decreases and there is less centralized control. The flow of information drops, people trade and interact less, and there is overall lower coordination among individuals and groups. Economic activity drops to a commensurate level, while the arts and literature experience such a quantitative decline that a dark age often ensues. Population levels tend to drop, and for those who are left the known world shrinks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>High upkeep of complex societies</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Complexity and stratification are oddities when viewed from the full perspective of our history, and where present, must be constantly reinforced. Leaders, parties, and governments need constantly to establish and maintain legitimacy. This effort must have a genuine material basis, which means that some level of responsiveness to a support population is necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Civilization itself (i.e., great complexity), to Rappaport, may be maladaptive: Civilisation has emerged only recently - in the past six thousand or so years - and it may yet prove to be an unsuccessful experiment' (Rappaport 1977: 65).</p>
<h1>Misc</h1>
<p>The Ik People are really fascinating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children are minimally cared for by their mothers until age three, and then are put out to fend for themselves. This separation is absolute. By age three they are expected to find their own food and shelter, and those that survive do provide for themselves. Children band into age-sets for protection, since adults will steal a child's food whenever possible.</p>

    <title>Understanding How We Learn: A Visual Guide</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I read this book because it was recommended by C for work. This book serves as a nice visual summary of what we know about learning from a cognitive science perspective. The authors lament the large gap between what we know from this field and how educators do their job in practice.</p>
<h1>Educational myths</h1>
<p>Educational practices rely too much on intuition, and not enough on science. The authors make an analogy to medicine, and a scientific approach improved health outcomes dramatically around the turn of the 20th century. For examples, students read textbooks and notes repeatedly because it feels good, but this does not improve their learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Cognitive psychology can immediately debunk many myths in education:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals DON’T learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style (e.g., auditory, visual, kinesthetic) <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Learning_styles_are_a_stubborn_myth">Learning styles are a stubborn myth</a></li>
<li>Environments that are rich in stimuli DON’T improve the brains of pre-school children.</li>
<li>Short bouts of coordination exercises DO NOT improve integration of left and right hemisphere brain function.</li>
<li>Exercises that rehearse coordination of motor-perception skills CAN’T improve literacy skills.</li>
<li>Differences in hemispheric dominance (left brain, right brain) DO NOT help explain individual differences among learners.</li>
<li>It has NOT been scientifically proven that fatty acid supplements (omega-3 and omega-6) have a positive effect on academic achievement</li>
<li>Emotional brain processes DO NOT interrupt those brain processes involved with reasoning</li>
<li>We DO NOT only use 10% of our brain</li>
<li>Memory is NOT stored in the brain much like as in a computer: each memory goes into a tiny piece of the brain</li>
<li>Children are NOT less attentive after consuming sugary drinks and/or snacks</li>
</ol>
<p>Good start. But it's hard to learn from a bunch of negation. The meat of the book is covered by first introducing human cognitive processes, which serve as an underpinning for everything. Then, the real gems are in the following section, which articulates  strategies for effective learning which were generated from theory, have been verified in the lab, and sometimes even in the classroom.</p>
<h1>Part 2: Summary of human cognitive processes</h1>
<h2>Sensation and perception</h2>
<p><strong>Sensation</strong> the output of sense organs. This will vary depending on your senses, but is generally objective</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> your interpretation of the sensations. This is generally very subjective, and depends on the context and the person</p>
<p>One way in which perception is subjective is illustrated by <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Intensity_of_stimulus_is_proportional_to_the_pre-existing_stimulus,_and_logarithmic_(Weber-Fechner_law)">Intensity of stimulus is proportional to the pre-existing stimulus, and logarithmic (Weber-Fechner law)</a>, which says that what you perceive is highly dependent on what you were just perceiving. This is true for both time and space.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom-up vs top-down processing</strong>: bottom-up processing focuses on the stimulus only, without bringing prior knowledge to make sense of it. This is similar to just sensing? Top-down processing involves using prior knowledge. For example, you hear a fire alarm, but know it was part of the fire drill, so remain calm (top-down). A baby, however, gets upset and cries (bottom-up).</p>
<p><strong>Curse of knowledge</strong> refers to the problem that a teacher may know a lot more than the student, and lack the empathy to decide how to properly explain something so that the student understands. Reminds me of https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/</p>
<h2>Attention and cognitive load</h2>
<p>Attention is a limited capacity resource. If you work on a difficult task, all of your attention is required. A simple task will leave you with some left over attention. <strong>Cognitive load</strong> is a measure of how much of someone’s attention will be required to grok an explanation. The goal, then, is to minimize cognitive load but still convey the concept.</p>
<p>Attention involves focusing on one thing at a time. <strong>Multi-tasking</strong> for humans is similar to multi-tasking for machines: you end up duty-cycling from one “simultaneous” activity to the next. And this causes both activities to be done worse than if they were done sequentially. Nice demonstration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Count aloud 1-26</li>
<li>Recite letters A-Z</li>
<li>Combine (1) and (2), reciting 1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Empirically, it takes longer to do (3) than to do (1) + (2).</p>
<p>Attention can be focused towards the salient. For example, it’s easy to look around and quickly spot all objects that are red at will. In education, <strong>saliency</strong> comes from the students motivation, interest levels, the way the material is presented. This is very related to the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Krashen_-_Comprehensible_and_Interesting_Input">Krashen - Comprehensible and Interesting Input</a> approach.</p>
<p>Attention can also be lost, and this is known as <strong>mind wandering</strong>. This happens more during easy tasks, but also during very difficult tasks. This is one of the benefits of being in the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Zone_of_Proximal_Development_(ZPD)">Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</a>.</p>
<p>In the chunking example, where the authors provide the characters of CHAPTER6ATTENTION scrambled in random order, I am finding that I can remember it better with a mnemonic. I guess this is sort of the point of chunking: it’s a way for more information to be stored in short-term memory, by relying on “chunks” that are already in exiting memory.</p>
<p>Why does attention vary between people? Three theories, but no consensus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Differences in working memory capacity</li>
<li>Differences in processing speed</li>
<li>Differences in attentional control (uh, seems tautological)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Working memory</h2>
<p>Working memory is modeled by a few components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The phonological loop</strong>: stores and rehearses auditory and language information. I came across this recently noticing how much easier it is to remember OTP codes if I speak them out loud. The phonological loop need not rely on audible speech, subvocalizing works too (but maybe less effectively? Look into this)</li>
<li><strong>The visuospatial sketch pad</strong> helps store visual information, such as creating mental maps of how to go from the bedroom to the kitchen. It’s the machinery that lets you manipulate an object in your head.</li>
<li><strong>The central executive</strong> is not well defined in the book, presented as everything not in the two categories above.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Memory is needed to do almost everything</strong>, from remembering names, to remembering how to do something, to doing basic things like comprehending speech, to having a coherent sense of self.</p>
<p><strong>Memory is reconstructive</strong> Recalling things is not a pure lookup as in a library or a computer. Memory is reconstructive, which means that every time you retrieve it, you are actually changing it. This means that memory is not objective, Many memories we have of things never happened, or happened very differently. Memories can also be changed by others.</p>
<p><strong>Short term memory only last 15-30 seconds</strong>. Psych experiments can easily be run where you administer a quiz to people in that time range to see short term memory performance, and longer to see long term memory performance. Subjects with long term memory loss do very poorly at 30s+ time intervals compared to those with normally functioning memory. (Example: H.M.)</p>
<h2>Memory representations in the brain</h2>
<p>Memories are <strong>encoded</strong> in the brain by groups of nerve cells (neurons) which are connected to one another via connections (synapses). When active neurons in a certain group are simultaneously active (engram), we are able to recall a concept. These engrams can be connected to one another (by synapses) by neuronal pathways.</p>
<p>When we learn, new groups of neurons activate in response to the incoming information. Ideally, these just active neurons undergo <strong>consolidation</strong>. Connections to other engrams are strengthened to create a long lasting engram. Ideal conditions involve sufficient rest and sleep.</p>
<p>Consolidated memories become <strong>stored</strong> as long-term memories, which makes them available for <strong>retrieval</strong>. But consolidation is not a one-time event. Every time a memory is retrieved, it is subject to reconsolidation.</p>
<p>This memory model helps motivate some pedagogic approaches: spaced practice, creating meaningful connections to existing knowledge, retrieving prior knowledge.</p>
<p>As soon as you encode something, you immediately start to forget it. Forgetting curves show an exponential drop off in retrieval performance over time. But forgetting is not a binary. Retrieval can be greatly helped for example by providing retrieval cues, which greatly increase performance.</p>
<h1>Part 3: Strategies for effective learning</h1>
<p>Studies on brain-training games suggest that performance on the games does not transfer to real-life tasks.</p>
<p>Each of the following section introduces a study technique that has been shown to work through studies. Many of them overlap one another.</p>
<h2>Spaced repetition: spread study activities out over time</h2>
<p>Ebbinghaus (1885) first showed that spacing repetition over time rather than massing them together (ie. cramming) led to better results long-term. This is replicated widely in RCTs in many contexts, seems like a pretty fundamental piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>There is a well defined answer to the question “when should I be studying given that the test is on $DATE”. But how does this best work when there is no test, and the goal is just indefinite retention. Is this even a good goal? Surely there are benefits to forgetting things.</p>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Forgetting_curves_show_how_quickly_information_is_naturally_forgotten">Forgetting curves show how quickly information is naturally forgotten</a></p>
<h2>Interleaving: switch between topics while studying</h2>
<p>Focus on the same topic during a study session will improve results in the short term. But long term studies show that results are dramatically better in the interleaved case.</p>
<p>Which concepts should be interleaved? Studies show that interleaving completely unrelated concepts (eg. Science concepts and foreign language vocab) doesn’t lead to especially good outcomes. Also unclear what the effect is on attention. Is it bad like multi-tasking, or good because it reduces boredom?</p>
<p>Overall, a spaced repetition practice often includes interleaving naturally. But the authors acknowledge that establishing a spaced repetition practice is tricky. I think it’s even trickier for non-school settings.</p>
<h2>Elaborative interrogation: ask and explain how and why things work</h2>
<p>Elaborative interrogation (EI) is a specific method of elaboration where you ask yourself questions of how and why things work, then produce answers.</p>
<p>Cousins include <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Socratic_dialogue">Socratic dialogue</a> and the chain of why questions that toddlers and young children are famous for.</p>
<p>A study (Woloshyn and Stockley) found that EI led to better long term retention than re-reading the material. It worked in both an individual condition (self-asking and answering) and in pairs (one asks, the other answers, WLOG).</p>
<p>Performance was even better if an adequate answer to the question was produced by the student. But only works if background knowledge high enough. Otherwise better to read for understanding. Caveat</p>
<h2>Concrete examples: illustrate abstract concepts with specific examples</h2>
<p>It helps to ground an abstract idea by giving concrete examples that tie back to the concept. For example, the notion of scarcity can be described abstractly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: the rarer something is, the higher it’s value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But seeing this for the first time may be hard to internalize, so providing a variety of examples is worthwhile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Concrete: if you buy an airplane ticket 4 months in advance, there are many open seats on the plane and the price is low. If you buy last minute there are fewer (scarcity), and so their value is higher and the ticket costs more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even better is to provide multiple examples, from different domains. Given the above example, one about buying sports tickets would not be illuminating. But an example around water scarcity during a drought might be worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Dual coding: combine words with visuals</h2>
<p>Pictures are often remembered better than words, so the idea is to combine words and pictures to enhance learning. These can be diagrams, infographics, cartoon strips, etc. Presumably the same would apply to other mediums like video.</p>
<p>Combining modalities is helpful for all learners, not just those that like pictures or think of themselves as “visual learners”. Also, <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Learning_styles_are_a_stubborn_myth">Learning styles are a stubborn myth</a>.</p>
<p>One pitfall is to include visuals that are distracting because they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Too far from the content being studied, or</li>
<li>Too much information, causing cognitive overload</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is clear and simple diagrams related to the target text.</p>
<h2>Retrieval practice: bring learned information to mind from long-term memory</h2>
<p>Retrieval involves reconstructing something you’ve learned in the past, <strong>from memory</strong>, and thinking about it right now. The key part is that retrieval is done from memory, as opposed to having the reference material in front of you. (Abbott, 1909)</p>
<p>Direct benefit: retrieval practice is highly effective for long-lasting durable learning. This practice has been consistently shown to be more effective than repeated reading. It improves not just the memory’s durability, but also flexibility, helping make more far-reaching inferences. (Roedigger and Karpicke 2006)</p>
<p>Indirect benefit: students and teachers get feedback about what they know and don’t know. A computer system can track what students do and do not know.</p>
<p>Because memory is reconstructive, accessing it repeatedly might send signals to the brain that this bit is important. But a lot of the underlying principles of why retrieval practice works aren’t known yet.</p>
<p>Many possible forms of retrieval practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write everything they know on a blank sheet</li>
<li>Create concept maps from memory</li>
<li>Draw a diagram from memory</li>
<li>Explain what they can remember to another person</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need to be ZPD</strong>: If a retrieval task is too hard, students will be discouraged. If it’s too easy, they will be bored. Need to be in the <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Zone_of_Proximal_Development_(ZPD)">Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</a>, while retaining <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Desirable_difficulties">Desirable difficulties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Failed retrieval can still help</strong>: there is evidence that even a failed retrieval attempt can improve learning.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback &gt; no feedback</strong>: Authors discourage letting students self-grade. You can address their misunderstandings directly if you have an idea of what they got wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed feedback?</strong>: Giving some feedback is better than giving none. But supposing we can give feedback, there’s also the question of when to best present it. But then there’s the danger of thinking they answered correctly when they were in fact incorrect.</p>
<h2>Strategy: frequent, low-stakes quizzes</h2>
<p>In addition to measuring performance, tests are also retrieval practice. But high pressure tests decrease learning benefits.</p>
<p>Both short-form answer and multiple choice quizzes have been shown to be effective. Short form answers are slightly better for retrieval, but not significantly (Smith and Karpicke, 2014). Multiple choice questions require a bunch of reasonable distractors to be effective.</p>
<h2>Scaffolding: retrieval practice should be modified for some learners</h2>
<p>Interesting if not directly related: this doesn’t work well on 4th graders, because the task of writing out everything they know on a blank sheet of paper is daunting. Young learners have a very low (9%) recall rate after reading a passage.</p>
<p>Solution might be to help them review the material first, which is called scaffolding. One example is to give a partially completed concept map based on the passage, then have the student fill out the rest, then do the recall. This has been shown to be very effective.</p>
<p>Look into this idea of “guided notes” for a subject. Take notes on a worksheet with cues and blank spaces, so that you are forced to take notes about specific concepts covered in class. (Konrad, Joseph &amp; Eveleigh, 2009)</p>
<h1>Establishing a spaced repetition practice is hard</h1>
<p>Again that damned study about how taking notes by hand is a better way to retain memory than by computer. (Muller &amp; Oppenheimer 2014)</p>
<p>Spacing practice is hard to get into. Authors suggest getting students to do personalized scheduling so that they can squeeze spaced retrieval sessions in on a daily basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spacing: find a regular time to review</li>
<li>Elaborative interrogation: ask questions about how and why things work</li>
<li>Concrete examples: think about turning ideas into concrete examples</li>
<li>Visuals: combine visuals and words</li>
<li>Retrieval practice: bring information to mind independent of any crutch</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to apply these strategies in AI-assisted learning</h1>
<p><strong>Elaborative interrogation</strong>: I wonder if it would help to let learners take one of the sides and the AI takes the other? Here's how it might work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given a topic, generate some comprehension questions and have the learner answer.</li>
<li>Given a topic, have the learner come up with comprehension questions themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Concrete examples</strong>: Can LLMs generate concrete examples of abstract concepts?</p>
<p><strong>Quiz short answer grading</strong>: Can LLMs be used to grade short answer questions for how well they match the model answer? Anki and Orbit don't do this at all.</p>
<p><strong>Quiz multiple choice distractors</strong>: Can LLMs be used to generate reasonable distractors?</p>
<p><strong>Scaffolding: concept maps</strong>: Can LLMs be used to provide scaffolding? Perhaps a concept map can be intelligently blanked depending on skill level?</p>
<p><strong>Scaffolding: guided notes</strong>: Can LLMs intelligently generate a cloze reading activity?</p>

    <title>The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>It's been years since I would have said that I aspire to be a rationalist. But I've been swimming in rationality circles for long enough that some of the arguments and ideas in the book are somewhat trite. But I have enjoyed Julia’s podcast for her crispness of thought, ability to popularize, and pleasant voice. I'd recommend this book for someone unfamiliar with modern rationalism that's looking to get their feet wet. It's definitely a more coherent and less overwhelming starting point than lesswrong.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to the takedown of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Gerd_Gigerenzer_on_Gut_Feelings">Gerd Gigerenzer on Gut Feelings</a>, who’s ideas I am sympathetic to.</p>
<p><strong>Soldier mindset</strong> we tend to defend our beliefs against any evidence or arguments that might threaten them. Reasoning in the English language is often described through militaristic metaphors. We try to “shore up” our beliefs, “support them” and “buttress them” as if they’re fortresses. We try to “shoot down” opposing arguments and we try to “poke holes” in the other side.</p>
<p><strong>Scout mindset</strong> The scout’s job is not to attack or defend; it’s to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles. Above all, the scout wants to know what’s really out there as accurately as possible.</p>
<p>Julia argues that scout mindset is always better than soldier mindset. There are some parallels to hedgehogs (Soldiers) and foxes (Scouts) too, as in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox_by_Isaiah_Berlin">The Hedgehog and the Fox by Isaiah Berlin</a>. There are also echoes of System 1 (Soldier) and System 2 (Scout) ideas from <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Thinking_Fast_and_Slow_by_Kahneman_and_Tversky">Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman and Tversky</a>.</p>
<h1>Rational irrationality</h1>
<p>Sometimes it's rational to be irrational. For example, you your outcomes as a start-up founder might be better if you have irrational belief in yourself (IS). This can be described as "rational irrationality", which is paradoxical. My prior is that this is well warranted sometimes.</p>
<p>Galef diffuses this paradox and explains what's going on clearly and succinctly. What's happening is that two meanings of rationality are being used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrumental rationality involves the pursuit of a particular end goal, by any means necessary.</li>
<li>Epistemic rationality involves achieving accurate beliefs about the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to rephrase the paradox is to diffuse it: it may be <strong>instrumentally</strong> rational to be <strong>epistemically</strong> irrational. This is highly related to <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Information_Hazards">Information Hazards</a>.</p>
<h1>Always strive for epistemic rationality</h1>
<p>Galef argues the "тайное становятся явным" idea, something <a href="https://vseskazki.su/dragunskii-deniskiny-rasskazy/tajnoe-stanovitsya-yavnym.html">I grew up with</a>. Lying to yourself has the same downsides as other social lies that beget more lies. The cascade of muddled thinking proceeds with potentially very long delays and unpredictable outcomes. This is a good argument.</p>
<p>Elon Musk assigned a 10% chance of success to his ventures Space X and Tesla, but decided it was worth trying anyway. Mainly because of the cool factor and his ideological considerations. Green energy!! Electric cars!! Also, space!! But also, rationally speaking, the expected outcome was still high, since the impact of being successful was potentially so great. This resonates with me too, and part of why I think it's worth starting an early stage company one day.</p>
<p>But I still struggle with the absolutist framing that Galef presents. Surely there are situations where you would rather not have maximum rationality? Perhaps actual Infohazards? Or information that would best not be known to you. For example, if you somehow knew exactly how long you would live, it's easy to imagine negative second order effects.</p>
<h1>Thought experiments for clearer thinking</h1>
<p>Sometimes, if you're about to make a difficult decision, Galef suggests trying one of these thought experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The double standard test</strong>. Are you judging one individual or group by a standard that is different from other individuals or groups?</li>
<li><strong>The outsider test</strong>: how would you evaluate this situation if it wasn’t your situation?</li>
<li><strong>The conformity test</strong>. If other people no longer held the view, would you no longer hold it?</li>
<li><strong>The selective skeptic test</strong>. If this evidence supported the other side, how credible would you judge it to be?</li>
<li><strong>Status quo bias test</strong>. If your current situation was not the status quo, would you actively choose it?</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect the hardest part about Galef's advice is being sufficiently mindful to decide that now is a good time to try.</p>
<p>The idea of calibrated bets is a great one that I've incorporated into my New Years routine. I set predictions for a year ahead on all fronts (SSC, AK inspired) and then see how well calibrated I am.</p>
<p>However generating probabilities for predictions is always tricky. Galef also introduces a technique for called the <strong>equivalent bet test</strong>, which she attributes to Douglas Hubbard. The way it works is to compare the issue at hand to a simpler scenario where you randomly draw balls from a jar. One of N balls in the jar is black, and the rest are white. You play with which N would feel right so that both bets yield the same winnings.</p>
<h1>Celebrity calibration</h1>
<p>I love that Galef picks on Spock, who is often considered a model of rationality. By showing how poorly calibrated he is, she also dispels the idea that being rational means being robotic and failing to understand humans.</p>
<p>In spirit of Spock’s poor calibration, what can we say about Elon Musk's calibration? He gave 10% chance of success to two of his successful companies!</p>
<h1>Epistemic vs. social confidence</h1>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Social_confidence_vs._epistemic_confidence">Social confidence vs. epistemic confidence</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Soldier as press secretary: extremely high social confidence, and artificially
  inflated, unawarranted epistemic confidence.</li>
<li>Scout as board of directors: calibrated epistemic confidence. Knowing what is
  really true is extremely important.</li>
</ul>
<p>Her example of Vitalik Buterin is maybe slightly unfortunate. He seems really smart, and appears to be well calibrated epistemically. But he is too dorky to be a paragon of social confidence, in my opinion.</p>
<h1>Keep your identity...?</h1>
<p>Julia Galef and Paul Graham are overly bearish on identity. But identity is what makes you who you are. By rooting it out you demolish your own uniqueness, traditions, original insights. In this sense I am in favor of intersectionality, but broadly construed. Diversity (see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Measuring_non-woke_diversity_broadly">Measuring non-woke diversity broadly</a>) not of skin color and gender but of substantive and nuanced things like having been homeschooled, or being a practicing orthodox Christian or believing in Gaia theory or the fact that you raised three children on a 30’ sailboat circumnavigating the globe. Maybe you are super old and survived the Leningrad blockade. Maybe you grew up in desperate poverty. Or even, that you grew up as the son of a Saudi Prince. These things will give you a different perspective on life, and are genuinely valuable to bring to the table.</p>

    <title>History of Future Cities by Daniel Brook</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This book explores planned cities over the centuries, built in the not-west to emulate western iconic cities: St. Petersburg, Mumbai, Shanghai, and Dubai. The whole east-west distinction is a bit funny, and the author disparages it by the end. The selection of cities is also a bit arbitrary.</p>
<p>I usually read books linearly, having never quite mastered the art of skimming. However in this book, each chapter covers one period of each city's history, and I decided to read the St. Petersburg sections first. I learned a lot about my birth-city, piecing together little stories that I'd known into a grander narrative, and filling in new ones. The architectural tour aspect of the book also pleasantly surprised me.</p>
<p>But there were also shortcomings. First, there are strange factual errors. For example, Kunstkamera was not the first public museum in the world, which the author claims (twice!). Second, liberties are taken to shoehorn the history of St. Pete into a very slick narrative centered around an idea that St. Petersburg is a fake city, a Potemkin village. This vantage point is somewhat disparaging, and profoundly western. I don't think Потёмкинские деревни have nearly the same cultural significance in Russia.</p>
<p>Ultimately I won't read the whole book, and can't broadly recommend this one unless you have personal ties to one of the cities.</p>
<hr />
<h1>St. Petersburg: 1703 - 1825</h1>
<p>German - немец shares a root with немой - mute. A general shorthand for all foreigners.</p>
<p>Peter I traveled incognito 🥸 thru Amsterdam as Peter Mikhailov. He got an internship at a shipyard and truly lived that life for four months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amsterdam was a kind of factory for creating modern people… just as a well designed sawmill could transform rough timber into uniform usable planks so too a city, if properly designed could shape even the toughest hewn barbarians into civilized men and women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Very Le Corbusier: A house is a machine for living in)</p>
<p>Witnessing the parliament of William III shortly after the glorious revolution, Peter remarked that it was good that the ruler was given counsel, but to be bound by any of it was an outrage.</p>
<p>Peter concluded his trip to Holland with realization of importance of sea port. But Russia was landlocked, so he conquered St. Petersburg which was Swedish at the time.</p>
<p>As a modernization means, Peter forced all men to shave their beards and cut off the flowing sleeves of their caftans.</p>
<p>St. Petersburg was built by serfs on 6 month tours of duty. Peter ordered 40,000 a year. And they didn't even have wheelbarrows. Known as a “city built on bones”. Peter boasted 100,000 died building it. Reminds me of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Roman_slaves_were_cheaper_than_machines">Roman slaves were cheaper than machines</a></p>
<p>Peter mandated travel by boat, but banned oars to force his people to learn how to sail by the wind alone. Nobles were gifted sailboats whose size corresponded to their rank. Peter built canals throughout the city to facilitate travel by water, but neglected to consider that they would freeze in winter.</p>
<p>Peter imported books on architecture and employed hundreds of foreign architects. His lead was <strong>Dominico Trezzini</strong>. The city arose out of imported theory rather than locally rooted processes, and tended towards extremes.</p>
<p>The Kunstkamera, constructed in 1727 was the first public museum in Russia (author claims the world, but AFAICT it's The Ashmolean in Oxford, c. 1683), where Peter hoped to educate the general public. When his aides suggested he charge for entry, he even provided visitors with vodka and snacks.</p>
<p>Peter began hosting concerts of instrumental music, which was illegal in Moscow because god had to be praised by the human voice alone. He imported French salons as “assemblies” which he observed in Paris.</p>
<p>In Moscow, the German quarter was cordoned off from the rest of city out of fears that foreigners would corrupt the Russians with their unorthodox ways. In St. Petersburg, the немцы were integrated and were allowed to build non-orthodox churches and even conduct services in foreign languages.</p>
<p>By 1720 st. Pete had population of 40,000. Thirty years before, it was a swamp.</p>
<p>Peters son Alexis did not approve of St. Petersburg, thinking it was too western facing. He attempted a coup and vowed to return the capital to Moscow. Peter sentenced his own son to death in 1717.</p>
<p>Peter was succeeded by Anna, an empress and intellectual lightweight who did little and reverted to frivolity. She built the worlds largest ice palace. But she also commissioned the winter palace (hermitage) done by <strong>Bartolommeo Rastreli</strong>. Was she all that useless?</p>
<p>Catherine married Peter's grandson Peter III and took the throne in 1762. By then the city's population was 100,000. She followed in Peter's footsteps, turning it westward again. She hired <strong>Giacomo Quarenghi</strong>. All architects seemed to have been inspired by Palladio.</p>
<p>Catherine amassed European art. Her collection of 4000 paintings rivaled what generations of French kings collected in the Louvre for four centuries.</p>
<p>Catherine corresponded with Voltaire, who wrote a hagiography of Peter I. She imported Voltaire's works and invited Diderot to Russia. His stay was short lived since he had some radically egalitarian ideas. He saw Russia as a blank slate that was easier to reform than Europe. (Prescient given the communist revolution to come). Ultimately Diderot was booted for suggesting to dismantle Russian serfdom, a system of “masters and slaves”, which was the last straw.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only was the empress seeking advice from foreign experts when Peter had vowed that Russia would “show Europe its ass”, but when they offered advice to empower the people, the empress refused to take it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Catherine did take some advice. And attempted to bring open debate by running public salons in the winter palace. But the French Revolution of 1789 changed this openness. And her lieutenant Radischev wrote a French Revolution inspired “Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow”, highly sympathetic to the plight of serfs, including plans for abolition. This closed the window for Catherine and Russia was firmly an autocracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open debate would reign within the winter palace even as autocracy prevailed outside its walls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Alexander I, grandson of Catherine, defeated napoleon and entered Paris in 1814, Peter the Great's vision of modernity without democracy was fulfilled. Russia was compared to Rome and Alexander I went on a building spree, rapping <strong>Carlo Rossi</strong>, who trained in Rome. He was most famous for the general staff building and an arch.</p>
<p>French influences were still prominent even after 1814. <strong>Auguste de Montferrand</strong> redesigned the St. Isaac's cathedral. In his bid he presented oil paintings of many possible styles: Indian, Chinese, Byzantine, green etc. but the choice was obvious: giant gilded neoclassical dome. Just like the best of Europe!</p>
<p>As the Russian army marched through Europe pursuing the fleeing armies of Napoleon, they saw what Europe was like, and how much more advanced it was than Russia economically, socially, educationally and politically. St. Pete’s in contrast began to seem like a “Giant Potemkin village”.</p>
<p>This planted the seeds of the Decembrist revolt, organized by six members of the imperial guard, who wanted to bring constitutional government to Russia. Waiting for a succession, they vowed to make a move during the chaos that would ensue. Instead, they were massacred in front of the Hermitage.</p>
<p>Subsequently, to tamp down future rebellions, Nicholas I instituted a secret police to watch dissent, suggested that European travelers come back with criticism, and pared back liberal arts education to focus on technical subjects instead. The window to the west was closing.</p>
<h1>St. Petersburg: 1825 - 1934</h1>
<p>Mind blowing connection of the Russian word вокзал named after the first train station in Tsarskoe Selo, modeled after Vauxhall station in London. “A permanent reminder of Russia's cribbed modernity at its most blatant”.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the first railway line connected the capital with the tzar's residence, a vanity project. Meanwhile, a national railway network was nixed out of fear that “frequent purposeless travel would foster the restless spirit of our age”. Reminds me of the crackdown on <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Parasitism_in_Soviet_Russia">Parasitism in Soviet Russia</a>.</p>
<p>Funny: when European fashions changed to wearing facial hair, Petersburgers followed suit, reversing Peter's decree. Gogol mocks this in “Nevsky prospect”.</p>
<p>The Crimean War loss at the end of Nicholas I's rule was a wake up call. His son Alexander II took the reigns and undid many of the harshest policies of his predecessors. He freed the serfs in 1861, freeing 22 million people and set Russia up for an industrial path.</p>
<p>Sept 1 1861: St. Petersburg University Rebellion demanding a democratically elected leader not a tzar. I've never heard of this, nor had dad, and so I dug in a bit. The author claims "the university was closed outright for two years", while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Imperial_University">Wikipedia says</a> "it was temporarily closed twice during the year".</p>
<p>Narodniks were student intellectuals that went to the people (народ) to try to spread revolutionary ideas. First they tried with pamphlets but the peasants were illiterate (hmm... really?). Then they tried with speeches and the peasants reported them to the tzar. By 1877, 1600 students were imprisoned in Peter and Paul fortress.</p>
<p>The radicals adopted another strategy. A new organization, The People's Will began to assassinate key regime officials. Alexander II had his liberal interior minister draw up plans to ease censorship, abolish secret police and allow elected representatives to vote in national affairs. Alas, the peoples will succeeded after six attempts to assassinate the tzar.</p>
<p>Instead of triggering a revolution, they triggered succession, and Alexander III was far more conservative than his father. Rather than moving the capital back to Moscow, he brought Moscow to St. Petersburg by erecting a large cathedral: Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. This structure designed by an archimandrite (orthodox title) with no architectural background, stood out like a sore thumb in the middle of the city. “A deliberate intrusion of the real Russia onto the Petersburg scene”.</p>
<p>Alexander II spurred economic development and sent his finance minister Michael von Reutern to pitch Russia as an emerging market with western conveniences and convenient labor practices. Workers were cheap, had no rights, no ability to speak freely, publish, march, or vote. This was a resounding success and Russia grew at 8% per year from 1860-1900. The Russia American red triangle rubber factory 🔺🏭 was built then. My grandparents worked there for decades. That's where they met.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the city was densifying as more and more peasant workers were moving in. Soon it was twice as crammed as Paris, Berlin, or Vienna. The death rate was highest of all European cities in 1870. Peterburgers topped the nation in vodka consumption, crime was rampant, prostitution was legal and ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Mass education was one of the rare successful social endeavor in St. Petersburg around this time. By 1910, 80% of the population was literate, and this mass literacy was a social innovation the elite would come to regret.</p>
<p>Singer Sewing Machine an example of another company establishing Russian HQ. The Singer Building was architecturally notable. One of many, though.</p>
<p>Putilov Works was a giant ironworks employing 12,000 people, operated by the richest merchant oligarch family of the era. Attempts were made to control them by building incongruous churches adjacent to the plant, but this failed. Eventually, under Gregory Gapon, workers organized and went on strike when four of them were fired for joining the union. In 1905, a general strike extended to 120,000 Petersburgers. A petition was extended demanding freedom of speech, press and assembly, free public education, minimum wage, an eight hour work day, and legalization of unions.</p>
<p>Five thousand protesters led by Gapon were joined by curious sympathizers as they marched along Nevsky prospect. By the time they converged onto the Winter palace, 60,000 men, women, and children awaited. What followed was a massacre claiming 1,000 lives called “Bloody Sunday”, when Tzarist troops opened fire. What followed was a revolution in which the weak tzar Nicholas II, recently defeated by Japan, escaped to Tsarskoe Selo. Eventually the people got what they wanted: autocracy was abolished and a parliament (the Duma) was founded.</p>
<p>However this democratic stint was short lived. In 1906, nearly half of the Duma’s representatives were rural peasants, underscoring Russia’s backwardness (really?). Further, Nicholas II dissolved the Duma and called for new elections. He did this repeatedly to limit the socialists in its ranks.</p>
<p>Nicholas II became increasingly insular, hiding from the people in Tsarskoe Selo. He pined for the Russia before Peter the Great turned westward, adopting the title tzar (instead of emperor, preferred by Peter and used by many Russian monarchs). He wore a beard, a caftan with long impractical sleeves, and commissioned his architects to build the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80_(%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD)">Feodorov village</a>, a mini walled town modeled after the 17th century.</p>
<p>In St. Petersburg, he built the Romanov Tercentenary to commemorate the 300 anniversary of Romanov rule.</p>
<p>World War I gave Nicholas the opportunity to turn populist. A crowd of 250,000 sang “боже царя храни”, and then burnt the German embassy to the ground. He renamed the city to Petrograd since “burg” was viewed as too German. No matter that it was named after Holland.</p>
<p>But the jubilation was short lived, and massive casualties begat draft dodgers, crowds chanting “Down with the autocracy”, singing the Marseillaise, and rioting. Police stations, prisons, courthouses were torched. Protesters were killed by the dozens, and soon the army refused to fire on more people.</p>
<p>Nicholas abdicated the throne and gave up power to his brother, who also refused it. A temporary government was set up under Kerensky.</p>
<p>Some concessions were given to the labor movement: an eight hour work day. But real wages plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Lenin’s Bolsheviks called for national transformation, echoing Peter the greats conviction he could autocratically wrench Russia into the modern world without having to wait for more organic development from below.</p>
<p>After the successful October revolution, Lenin found himself in a civil war which erupted against an alliance of opponents aided by anti-communist western powers like Britain, France, and the USA. The capital was moved from Petrograd to Moscow for military strategic reasons.</p>
<p>In the Kremlin centuries ago, a bearded theocratic elite ruled Russia following eternal truths of church teachings. Now a new class of grey men would rule according to the holy canon of official Bolshevik doctrine. (Really?)</p>
<p>After the civil war was won and the whites were crushed, major changes came to St. Petersburg. Originally the gateway through which European ideas including Marx’s flowed into the country. When Lenin came to power, new ideas became a threat. Lenin quickly set up the Cheka secret police to stifle Petrograd's “embittered bourgeoisie intelligencia”. Meanwhile wages fell and food became scarce and Petrograd dropped from 2.3 million in 1918 to 0.7 million in 1920 (!!) as workers returned to their villages and became peasants again. (Shocking drop— was it due to foreign divestment?)</p>
<p>Worker strikes spread to the naval installation of Kronstadt, and 10,000 sailors rose up against Bolshevism. The rebellion was crushed violently but made Lenin lay off Petrograd and give the city a bit of breathing room. When Lenin died in 1924 the city was renamed in his honor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Russia felt to the exterior world like once again a promising blank slate as under Catherine the great. This time there were more talented Russians  to lead the charge.</p>
<p>The Bauhaus movement found eager home in the Soviet state. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatlin%27s_Tower">Tatlin's Tower</a> was an ambitious modern example of such a project but was never built for lack of funds.</p>
<p>Constructivism became Russia's distinctive style of modernism integrating obsession with geometry and perspective. Example: <a href="http://architectuul.com/architecture/gorky-palace-of-culture">Palace of Culture</a>. <a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2301/on-tractor-street">Tractornaya Ulitsa</a> homes were a tasteful update on classic Petersburg forms. I'm reminded of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Palaces_for_the_People_by_Eric_Klinenberg">Palaces for the People by Eric Klinenberg</a>, just making the connection from the name.</p>
<p><strong>Erich Mendelssohn</strong> was brought to design red banner factory in 1925, which looked like a giant ocean liner ready to set sail.</p>
<p>This period of early soviet avant-garde was short lived as cultural conservatives gained the upper hand, chief among them Stalin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As in the Age of Enlightenment, Russia’s window on the west birthed dreams of a glorious future only to smother them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>St. Petersburg: 1934 - 1985</h1>
<p>Using Kirov’s murder as pretext, Stalin issued an order expediting political investigations. The soviet constitution did guarantee some civil liberties, but these no longer applied. It’s now widely believed that Kirov was killed on Stalin’s orders too. Anyway, the result was a giant supposed conspiracy in which thousands of Russians were accused of being in cahoots with western capitalist powers.</p>
<p>The Great Purge ultimately took millions of people. Not just active party cadres, but anyone politically or intellectually active, including my great grandfather. “Black Ravens” would come by night in black vans and disappear “enemies of the people”. And most of these were in Leningrad, a gateway to western ideas which helped launch the revolution, and was now such a threat to the new regime.</p>
<p>Stalin likely admired Hitler’s June 1934 Night of the Long Knives, in which he orchestrated murder of his fellow Nazi Party founders.</p>
<p>During his decades of rule, Stalin hardly ever set foot in Leningrad, made many attempts to downgrade it to just another city. Even in the first five year plan in 1928, Stalin focused on industrializing the rest of the country, divesting from Leningrad. The Bolsheviks renamed the streets around Спас на Крови after the names of the murderers of Alexander II, but Stalin changed the names back, to ensure those that rise up against their leaders were not glorified.</p>
<p>Stalinist architecture was built with neoclassical facades, replacing modernist avant-guard of the old soviet state. These structures were massive and imposing, a return to order reminiscent of the Romanovs, but also epitomizing high modernism. An example of this is House of the Soviets, and everywhere, giant statue of Lenin loomed.</p>
<p>Hitler called Leningrad “the poisonous nest from which, for so long, Asiatic venom has spewed forth into Europe”, and aimed for full destruction. Awesome!</p>
<p>Head of Hermitage <strong>Iosif Orbeli</strong>, anticipating German invasion, packed half a million objects and sent them east to Sverdlovsk just before the Germans severed the rail connections, as the city was falling apart.</p>
<p>By 1941, the Germans had fully cut off food supplies from Leningrad. Once the crumbs were consumed, tens of thousands of died a month. People survived eating binding glue from books, boiling belts into thin soup, eating mysterious meat patties. Over a million died in the 900 day siege. And this is not ancient history — my grandfather lived through this.</p>
<p>Stalin may have been deliberately slow to stop the siege, as he watched the city he hated be crushed by Nazi air raids. The Smolny party headquarters were camouflaged, while great buildings like St. Isaac’s and the Admiralty were not. And party members were not starving like the commoners. Their only wartime rule was: no seconds of meat!</p>
<p>Throughout all this in 1941, a strike broke out at Kirov Works (formerly Putilov Works), where strikers demanded an end to Stalin’s Russia. This in the context of being fully cut off from the rest of Russia was a fascinating political threat from within.</p>
<p>The history associated with this period did not jive well with the party line. The curator of the Blockade Museum, which opened a few months after the end of the war, was promptly shot, and museum closed. Even the official Monument to the Defenders of Leningrad did not open until the 70’s.</p>
<p>Stalin's personality cult continued, and globalism was further curtailed. The Internationale, which called for universal proletarian solidarity was replaced with the soviet anthem, which name dropped Stalin. International Prospect was renamed after Stalin too.</p>
<p>In menial jobs there was no pressure to join the Party, so people took them, punched in, and spent the workday writing music and poetry. 1949 confiscation of saxophones. What.</p>
<p>Never heard of "Санкт Петербург" the punk band, actually pretty good, look up Владимир Рекшан.</p>
<h1>St. Petersburg: 1985 - ~now</h1>
<p>Under Gorbachev the city turned westward again and people made great strides in civil rights, especially of speech and assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Angleterre Hotel</strong>, a historical landmark was due to be razed in 1987. A crowd gathered to protest and the leader was told by officials that no such thing would happen. Half an hour later the hotel was demolished. A sign of the times, rather than dispersing the crowd stood its ground and formed an “information point”, dissenting in public. Known as Battle of the Angleterre.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Mikhailovsky Garden</strong>, Peter's assemblies and Catherine’s salons were revived on Saturday afternoons. This “Hyde Park” was shutdown and then moved to Nevsky prospect!</p>
<p>I didn't know the new name of the city was decided by popular referendum in June 1991. Choices were Leningrad and St. Petersburg. Solzhenitsyn wanted Svyato-Petrograd which is a bit awkward, and never made ballot.</p>
<p>Anatoly Sobchak, former head of Leningrad Soyuz was elected as head of Leningrad mayor of St. Petersburg. He aimed to turn the city into a special economic zone after China. He established ties with us universities and mega corps like Coca Cola and Gillette began opening offices in St. Pete.</p>
<p>Rather than a China-style transition to market economy slowly weaning unproductive industry from subsidies, St. Pete endorsed immediate removal of price controls, calling it “shock therapy”. The result was skyrocketing prices, "all shock and no therapy". Interesting debate about Shock Therapy between Joseph Stiglitz (against) and Jeffrey Sachs (in favor). Look into it later.</p>
<p>Major industries were converted into private companies and Russians were given a share worth 20$ of the new companies. Ownership was soon concentrated by those that had secretly accumulated money, taking advantage of cash strapped Russians. These new oligarchs rather than build up the companies, decided to sell everything and, and make out like bandits, literally. The St. Petersburg economists that endorsed this were so taken by the beauty of their theories that they were blinded by the damage on the ground. They became known as "Market Bolsheviks".</p>
<p>Western firms found that they needed to be headquartered in Moscow, since that is where the clique in power was based. Even Maersk, the Dutch shipping giant, moved their Russian headquarters to landlocked Moscow.</p>
<p>The early 90s were extremely rough: from 1990 to 1995, the number of Russians living on $4 a day or less went from 2M to 60M. Life expectancy went from 68.5 to 64.5. "everything Marx said about communism was wrong, but everything he said about capitalism was right"</p>
<p>By 1998, the ruble had collapsed. This economic chaos began to be associated with democracy in the Russian mind, and the people pined for a strong leader. Putin's Russia would be autocracy reborn. The next bits go into Putin's biography, mostly a rehash of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Nothing_is_True_and_Everything_is_Possible">Nothing is True and Everything is Possible</a>. Notably Putin consolidated TV networks under state control. Gasprom, the giant government owned conglomerate, benefited greatly from spikes in oil demand in the early 21st century.</p>
<p>The last St. Pete gubernatorial election was in 2003. In 2004, a law was passed that makes heads of all "federal subjects" (provinces, republics, territories, federal cities like St. Pete) appointed directly by the President of Russia. In the west we have checks and balances. In Russia we have check and mate (I made that up)</p>
<p>Valentina Matviyenko, Putin's puppet established the city as a Potemkin village, polishing the center but letting the heart rot. Russian visas are hard to come by, but it's very easy to get a 48 hour visa if you're coming to St. Pete on a Baltic cruise. Just enough time to get the "wow feels so european" vibe, spend some Euros, and get the fuck out.</p>
<h1>Overarching themes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Alexander II, Lenin and Gorbachev all embraced western ideas, and brought foreign influence to Russia and St. Pete.</li>
<li>But this spurred on a powerful countervailing force administered by rulers like Alexander I, Nicholas I, and Stalin that wanted Russia to look inwardly.</li>
<li>Even the western facing rulers avoided embracing political freedom and democracy. The trend continues to this day.</li>
<li>Great architecture, often built by foreign architects or under the auspices of some great Italian or French designs.</li>
<li>The Russians cribbed from the French. But the Germans cribbed from the Romans, and the Romans cribbed from the Greeks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>That the Romans copied doesn't mean that history is nothing but copying, but it does mean that copying is an integral part of history. [...] The US too, like the Germans and the Romans, consciously wrote itself into the western tradition.</p>

    <title>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism by Max Weber</title>

    <id>https://smus.com/books/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism-by-max-weber</id>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>Max Weber piqued my interest in an overview course in philosophy <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_Modern_Political_Tradition_-_Hobbes_to_Habermas">The Modern Political Tradition - Hobbes to Habermas</a>. I took a note about Weber's ideas then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends. Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When GB suggested that Weber's translated works were readable, I decided to take the plunge. Weber is sometimes long winded. The last sections seem to go deep into narrow protestant sub-sects and associated thinkers. Zinzendorf, Herrnhut and the Pietists were just a bit too much for me. I found this section to be repetitive and overly detailed. But other times, the text was so dense and rich I actually had to slow the audio book narration to below real-time, which is a first for me. If you are tempted to skim, be sure to read the last chapters.</p>
<p>According to Weber, Protestants in general are characterized by a strong piety and a remarkable proficiency at their trade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Striking] is the connection of a religious way of life with the most intensive development of business acumen among those sects whose otherworldliness is proverbial as their wealth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I think of a devoutly religious person, I think of them giving their whole life to god. My intuitive model is that of the Baal Shem Tov who spent every waking minute reading the Torah. Or a “athlete of god” who turns to extreme asceticism as a reaction to excesses of the established clergy.</p>
<p>Weber makes a sharp distinction: the Protestant work ethic is diametrically opposed to 1) joie de vivre and also to 2) aspirations for worldly progress. Instead, this work ethic is one tied to a deep faith. He cites Montesqieu, that the English have "progressed the farthest of all peoples of the world in three important things: in piety, in commerce, and in freedom." Weber's work focuses on the relationship between the first two.</p>
<h1>Satisfaction vs. acquisition</h1>
<p>Interesting distinction between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Satisfaction of needs and</li>
<li>Acquisition beyond those needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Economic traditionalism is exemplified in (1). But capitalism is mostly (2), an acquisitive economy.</p>
<p>The acquisitive economy relies on money and wealth as a measure of how well you have done your job.</p>
<p>The idea of a calling irrational and is associated with Protestantism according to Weber. He will tease this out in chapter 3.</p>
<h1>The Calling: from monasticism to craftsmanship</h1>
<p>Luther said that the fulfillment of worldly activity is the best way to worship the lord.</p>
<p>In the early Catholic Church, the notion of a calling was often applied to a monastic lifestyle. Worldly duties were derided. The individual should stay in the station he was given at birth and glorify god.</p>
<p>Luther translated this notion into something much more worldly. Religious authority was not reduced, but the calling could force you to pursue a path divergent from the station provided at birth.</p>
<p>The emphasis thus shifted from an unending glorification of god to a creation of god-glorifying works, fruits of your craft. I think of J. S. Bach as an exemplar of this attitude. Even mom has said that at her best, her hands are moved by god's grace.</p>
<p>The emphasis on works reminds me of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Never_Let_Me_Go_by_Kazuo_Ishiguro">Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</a>, in which students' works are harvested in order to prove that clone-students are worthy of salvation.</p>
<p>Weber enumerates protestant denominations that contributed to this solid work ethic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calvinism/Reformed (Presbyterians)</li>
<li>Pietism, a Calvinist-adjacent branch within Lutheranism.</li>
<li>Methodism, which split off from Anglicanism.</li>
<li>Sects from the Baptist movement.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Brief aside on protestant sects</h1>
<p>I've always found protestant denominations to be very confusing, and here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism#/media/File:Protestant_branches.svg">a
diagram I found helpful</a>.</p>
<p>I also spent a couple of hours trying to understand a bit beyond what the book has to offer, and here are my findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all branches of Protestantism stem from Luther directly. Some seem to be inspired by his disobedience, but don't inherit from Lutheranism directly.</li>
<li>Anglicanism was started by Henry VIII, a few decades after Luther (details of the story I will skip here). Puritans dissented against the Anglican church, demanding extreme divergence from Catholicism.</li>
<li>Methodists are a sort of Puritan revival, also splitting off from Anglicans. Their name comes from "method".</li>
<li>Weber refers to Moravians. These are followers of Jan Hus (mentioned in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Late_Middle_Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, and predates Luther by sixty years (!)</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of schisms, it's fascinating to watch two different strategies in the Christian world:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catholic schisms and re-unifications, all the while maintaining a unified organization.</p>
</li>
<li>Protestant forks and a branching hierarchy of denominations.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Predestination and its implications</h1>
<p>The strongest formulation of Calvinist concept of double predestination was that before birth, all people were destined to either go to heaven or burn in hell, regardless of their deeds. And which bucket you fell into was unknown until your death. For Calvin, man is created for god, not god for man. His decrees thus don’t need to be pleasant in the slightest. For the damned to complain of their lot is the same as animals complaining that they were not born as men. For god to change his mind on the basis of some earthly human actions would diminish his power. Puritans share the same view of predestination as Calvinists.</p>
<p>For Luther, the doctrine of predestination was initially important, but faded over time. The Lutheran concept of predestination is "single predestination", meaning that some people are pre-destined for salvation, but nobody is pre-destined for damnation.</p>
<p>This was a huge difference between Catholicism and Calvinism/Puritanism: for the Puritans, no amount of sacrament or worship was going to get you into heaven. So they deliberately avoided doing any ritualized burial, as that was seen as superstition. From this stemmed a general aversion to anything sensuous and emotional in culture and religion. These are no use towards salvation, merely deluding people via idolatrous superstition.</p>
<p><strong>Against magic</strong>: For the Puritan, the Catholic tradition looked as if “the priest was a magician who performed the miracle of transubstantiation and held the key to eternal life in his hand”. As a result, they made their project to "eliminate magic as a means of absolution".</p>
<p><strong>Individualism</strong>: This doctrine forms the roots of a disillusioned individualism. Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" is the most read Protestant book. The protagonist named Christian abandons his family to escape from the "City of Destruction" (this world), to the "Celestial City" (heaven). Once safe, he remembers that he should probably also bring his family too...</p>
<p><strong>Self-confidence</strong>: The elect and the damned do not differ in any way. This wasn’t a problem for Calvin, who felt himself obviously chosen. But for many others was not tenable, as everyone would wonder endlessly whether they are in a state of grace. The result is that all people must act with self confidence as if they are in a state of Grace, and avoid doubt at all cost. (The basis of high self confidence in the west?)</p>
<p><strong>Unbounded piety</strong>: In this view, Catholics live with “hand to mouth” piety. They try to be good but inevitably stray from the ideal, and then need to offset their misdeeds via confession or sacrament. In contrast, the Puritan would need to act as if they were in a state of grace, constantly are outdoing themselves in their piety. There is no upper bound on piety if you are truly one of the chosen. (Does this piety then translate into money in the modern age?).</p>
<p>(Is there predestination in Judaism?)</p>
<h1>Emphasis on works</h1>
<p>This more modern interpretation of the calling is intimately tied to producing great works. For Lutherans it wasn’t enough to do righteous works. They insisted on an emotional component. For them, the feeling of grace was needed to actually attain salvation (aka state of grace). For a Calvinist this was just empty emotion.</p>
<p>According to the Puritans, works are not the cause but only the proof of a state of grace, and only if the works are done for the glory of god alone. He who did not perform good works was not a true believer. The harshness of Calvinism continues to astound.</p>
<h1>Ben Franklin's post-religious take</h1>
<p>At first Weber appears to lambaste Ben Franklin for being overly pragmatic as he describes the “spirit of capitalism”, in a passage from his autobiography. Franklin's virtues are all merely a means to an end. In the end, if you are virtuous, you will have good standing with money lenders. This uncharitable take is very easy to mock, and has been done effectively by Ferdinand Kurnberger, who in "Picture of American Culture" describes Americans thus: "They make tallow out of cattle and money out of men."</p>
<p>But Weber gives Franklin a much more charitable interpretation. Franklin's response to “why should money be made from men?” comes from his strict Calvinist father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings. — Proverbs 22:29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Weber's account, Franklin philosophy as written in his autobiography is not greed at all, but a direct continuation of puritan ideals. Franklin was a self avowed deist, far less religious than his pious Puritan predecessors.</p>
<h1>Three attitudes to wealth</h1>
<ol>
<li>Wealth for its own sake, because of the desire to be wealthy. (Greed)</li>
<li>Wealth for the sake of a carefree life. (Sloth)</li>
<li>Wealth as a side effect of following your calling.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Calvinist/Puritan tradition holds that (3) is acceptable, but the rest are sinful. If your calling happens to be entrepreneurship, then wealth of your company is basically the explicitly endorsed goal.</p>
<p>Another pious angle on accumulating wealth is one of eventually giving it away. This idea of "earning to give" is quite old.</p>
<h1>Modernity (well, circa 1905)</h1>
<p>And so Max Weber us forced into this mandatory system of a calling, works, originally set out as an optional path.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresitible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the “saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.” But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber ends with a meta point. Modern man consistently underestimates the importance of religious influences in shaping modernity.</p>

    <title>ABC by Illich and Sanders</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/abc-by-illich-and-sanders"/>
    
    <updated>2021-09-15T09:00:00-00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind is an interesting deep dive into the way
that consciousness evolved throughout history, especially as a result of
literacy. I guess this is the Illich version of Orality and Literacy (which I
have not yet read).</p>
<p>In general, the book is overly declamatory, often feels like a sermon. Parts of it are more literary critique, especially where Illich/Sanders delves into specific literary works (Chaucer's Canterbury, Defoe's Journal, Twain's Huck Finn) and tries to make sweeping generalizations based on their novels. Arguments rely mostly on wordplay and clever assertions, but are often unconvincing.</p>
<p>Sections correspond to chapters in the book that I thought were vaguely interesting:</p>
<h1>Text</h1>
<p>The spread of writing turned society upside down in almost every domain. But the authors consider the subtler side. Everything we know about that society is conveyed to us through writing, including everything we know of the oral tradition of the time, leading to a paradox of “oral writing”.</p>
<p>With literacy, trust shifted from a spoken promise in the form of an oath, to a sealed document. Oaths were a conditional curse: let me be maimed if I break this promise. Formerly formulaic speeches like the Danes “by the ships side and the shields rim, by the swords edge and the horses thigh”, ritualized by raising weapon skyward and placing a foot on a stone. Instead of oaths, literacy led to a more legal and binding form of promise. It’s no surprise that we now use the book in the “pantomime of legal gesture”.</p>
<p>Authors points to a rapid increase in writing in the 13th century based on consumption of parchment and sealing wax. According to some records (uncited?), the numbers were 3 pounds a week in 1226, 13 in 1256, 31 in 1266. Similarly, the authors point to the number of recorded royal decrees  1080-1180: 3 to 60 for French kings, 25 to 115 for the English, 22 to 180 for popes. After that it’s exponential. From Pope Innocent III ending in 1215, 280 survive, Innocent IV ending in 1254, 730 survive, Boniface VIII ending in 1303, 50000.</p>
<p>Wills also became determined not by last words on the deathbed or a symbol imbued with meaning but by a sealed document. This transition happened in 12th century when symbols began to be engraved with explicit writings.</p>
<p>Written documents also enabled trust to be formalized. The issuer would create two copies: one for themselves and one for the recipient. Technical details around this included the seal, a signature, a date, creating a copy and storing it in a catalog, which is part of a register.</p>
<p>High Middle Age monks simply remembered where things were without a system. Earliest known scrutinium (monastic catalogs) were introduced in 1170. This is also the advent of libraries.</p>
<p>Writing enabled exact copying of materials, which became desirable. In 1283 Cambridge hired its first corrector whose job was to check documents according to form, legibility, word order, and spelling. Documents being identical became a criteria for legal validity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two hundred years before Gutenberg, archives gave rise to the intellectual prototype of printer matter: an original from which a number of identical copies had been produced and written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even people required “identification” (written credentials that are identical to your person). No wonder the domesday book doesn't include a list of people — there was probably no accounting of individuals at all at the time.</p>
<p>Around this time a written chronicle of time emerged too, an essential piece of cataloging many charters. Notaries would travel around and witness and date major transactions around them, from the birth of the Lord. This gave a new dimension to text: time. Documents could be ordered by recency. Time in general grows in importance as a result. In the dance of death genre, the hourglass is prominently displayed. Time is scarce.</p>
<p>In the 12th century, news needed to be proclaimed orally (by a herald, “heard”) for it to be official. The written copy (if any) was just a record of the oral delivery. A signet ring served as seal and was accompanied with arbitrary and ever changing signature. But then as courts became more concerned with authenticity, this practice changed into the 14th century and onwards. The author also writes that vellum (calf) was replaced with membranum (sheep) supposedly thinner, harder to erase and prevented forgeries. (This is surprising since I think vellum was more sought after). Slowly text became the medium of guarantee.</p>
<p>This is reflected in art: The Last Judgement involves the Archangel Michael depicted with a book in which the text of ones life is recorded and decisions made.</p>
<p>Early “writing” did not involve clutching a pen and drawing letters on parchment, but dictating to a scribe. So initially there was a gulf between writer and author. Wax tablets also played some role in writing, mostly for temporary note taking. (Interesting that this hasn't really been a focus in other works I've read on this topic.)</p>
<p>Words were initially not separated at all, but spaces between became common around the 7th century (confirm with <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Carolingian_minuscule">Carolingian minuscule</a>), in order to teach Latin to the barbarians as a foreign language.</p>
<p>Previously writing was arduous, inscribed with a knife on hard leather. New script emerged in the 13th century. This more circular cursive writing was easier to write using a quill on a smooth surface, on parchment or paper. By the 13th century scholars like Thomas Aquinas were writing on their own without the need for scribes, and drafts are preserved.</p>
<p>Later scholars had access to much smaller books which were portable and used as a reference enabling direct quotation from sources. But so far all quotations had to be made verbatim, since books were not structured in any way until 12th century.</p>
<p>Also see <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Reading_and_writing_transition_in_the_12th_century">Reading and writing transition in the 12th century</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to structured catalogs and libraries, books themselves became structured. Chapters and verses became the somewhat arbitrary superstructure placed after the fact over top the Old Testament only in 1200 (!).</p>
<p>Previously text and images were deeply interwoven. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtQAsvUiwPg">Book of Kells</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> provide two such examples. Now a monolithic text heavy manuscript was gaining shape, with structure and chapters and quotes separated visually from the rest of the content.</p>
<p>Another major change was that rather than always reading aloud, reading became a mostly silent pursuit.</p>
<h1>Self</h1>
<p>I enjoyed the Text chapter of this book, so decided to read on. The section on self is basically a great takedown of autobiographies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Autobiography is born out of hubris. In Franklin's case his autobiography grows out of the hubris of America’s emerging power - its myths and ideals - a power that actually thrives on mistakes. One merely seized upon them as Franklin makes clear and turns them into substantial financial success. Autobiography amplifies that power: since a person is literally creating a new being, he can smooth out the rough transitions in his life, clean up the mistakes to produce a polished and attractive literary self.</p>
<p>A chief obstacle to writing a modern autobiography is its ending. How can it end, really, reach its final conclusion, until the writer is dead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Malcolm X's autobiography is published posthumously. Maybe that's the ticket?</p>
<h1>Untruth and narration</h1>
<p>Love the Latin expression “ex suo digito suxit” - высосано из пальца - sucked out of ones finger. Finger and fiction are apparently connected through this? But I haven't been able to verify.</p>
<p>St Augustine defined every lie as an assault on the God given truth. A contempt of God. Fascinatingly this precludes fiction in the traditional sense of being fully invented. Epic bards retell old stories that really happened, not fictions. Storytellers too, are not inventing but retelling. Chaucer (1386) is supposedly the first English author to spin a tale. But he does this not explicitly, couching heavily.</p>
<p>Chaucer writes just as England is moving from a culture of orality to literacy. And finds himself in an awkward position between fact and fiction. He needs to have Canterbury story taken as truth “for this is the way readers come to enter into any fictional dream” and goes to great lengths to do this. He makes himself one of the pilgrims, and tells a story “Tale of Sir Thopas” which is so boring that the fictional hosts ask him to stop. But apparently “too much truth can get Chaucer into theological trouble”. Why???</p>
<p>Defoe writes a book entitled "Journal of the Plague Year" which is a semi-fictional journal of a man living in London in 1665, the last major plague outbreak. Authors claim that this is the first novel, but this is completely ludicrous. In fact Robinson Crusoe came before this Journal, which immediately nullifies many of the claims made. There are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_claimed_first_novels_in_English">many other candidates</a> for first novel too. Anyway, the authors really focus on the word “novel” and how it is closely related to “news” and shares the Latin root “novus”, new. Who cares?</p>
<p>By this point it is clear that this chapter has evolved into speculative literary criticism with very tenuous arguments based on word games. The end is especially cringeworthy, with a vast narrative being cobbled together on the basis of the three works encountered. It’s very shaky and very ideological and not convincing at all. A little reminiscent of Deschooling, but worse.</p>
<h1>Newspeak and UNIQUACK</h1>
<p>Speculative literary criticism continues into the 20th century, this time with Orwell's 1984. Fascinating pointers, but not much substance.</p>
<p>Basic English was a subset of English (less than 1000 words) popular in the 1950s as a universal language designed to increase international collaboration. Apparently Orwell was into it initially, then worked for the institute promulgating it and realized this was a terrible idea.</p>
<p>The authors declare that words like energy, sexuality, transportation, education, communication, information, crisis, problem, solution, are too vague, and “amoeba-words”. I don't understand why. Many of these have precise meaning depending on context. Maybe the authors felt that people don’t generally know these precise meanings and misuse them?</p>
<h1>Silence</h1>
<p>Authors introduce an idea of “alphabetic silence”: pauses between words, silent contemplation of text, meditative thought.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the interpretation of the Ten Commandments. What did the Israelites hear when they received the ten commandments? A few theories:</p>
<ol>
<li>They heard them all in the Divine Voice</li>
<li>They heard only the first two: “I am the lord thy God”, and “thou shalt have no other gods before me”, before being overwhelmed. The rest had to be received through Moses.</li>
<li>They heard only aleph (א), with which the first commandment begins, the first letter of anochi (אנוכי), and silent without a patach, merely commanding the mouth to open. “Rabbi Mendel Torum transforms the revelation on Mount Sinai into a mystical revelation, pregnant with infinite meaning, but devoid of any specific one.”</li>
</ol>

    <title>Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I really liked it. Author does a great job conveying little nuances of relationships. I feel similarly about past life and previous relationships that could have gone so differently.</p>
<p>At any rate it’s great writing and vivid character development. The love triangle is extremely strong. But the world building is pretty weak. How can the world of the "students" and the world of the rest of the population be so hermetic? They have full freedom to go anywhere, yet there is no interaction. On this topic, I find myself actively suspending disbelief.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I guess there are three possible scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hide the truth from clones, raise them like wolves, harvest their organs. (Ground truth universe)</li>
<li>Hide the truth from clone-students, give them a decent human childhood, harvest their organs. (Hailsham's approach)</li>
<li>Tell students the whole story which would deprive them of their childhood, but give them a chance to potentially empower them to change the system somehow. (Lucy's approach)</li>
</ol>
<p>I kept waiting for Tommy to attempt to change the system during his fourth donation. Ishiguro does some nice false foreshadowing, and when Tommy caves without a fight, the effect is one of resignation.</p>
<p>Systemic change is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>Everyone is born into some station and feels like they must do what it is they are born to do, rarely questioning or acting on their impulses. Tommy's river analogy comes to mind. People drift down this river of least resistance without much agency. If you were born as a student-clone, what would you do? Very likely, live the life allotted to you, in the best case that of a Hailsham student.</p>
<h1>We are in Hailsham</h1>
<p>The fact that the students can't have children of their own is the tragic part of this whole piece. In their lives, as in ours, death is guaranteed. In theirs, it becomes inevitable after the fourth donation, in ours after age 80 or 90. But the finality of death without children is such that all is lost. This is not really a well-developed theme in the book, more of a background take. Kathy makes it explicitly through the song.</p>
<p>I thought that Kazuo Ishiguro invented "Never Let Me Go" the song, and but it turns out that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UX6tzE7P44">the song is real</a>, the cover is real, and Judy Bridgewater is real. Honestly, this is disappointing. Previously, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nice use of the invented song, and vividly described. It serves as a really touching tearjerker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found the ending to be a little bit drawn out. For example I thought that the book would end at the scene where Tommy and Kathy go and talk to Madame. A lot of the stuff after that was a little bit less clear and might have just been possible to cut.</p>

    <title>Gardener &amp; Carpenter by Alison Gopnik</title>
    <author><name>Boris Smus</name></author>
    <link href="https://smus.com/books/gardener-carpenter-by-alison-gopnik"/>
    
    <updated>2021-08-25T09:00:00-00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>This one's been on my radar for years. I've read a lot of the author's articles and generally feel a strong affinity for Isaiah Berlin, whom Gopnik has done quite a bit to popularize. Self described as a Bubbie from Berkeley with a PhD in developmental neuroscience that sometimes dabbles in philosophy.</p>
<h1>Core idea</h1>
<p>The message promulgated in most parenting books is that raising kids is like carpentry: consider what material your dealing with, form a well specified blueprint, measure twice, cut once. Then you can judge how well you’ve done by the final result.</p>
<p>A parent’s goal should instead be to raise their child like resilient garden that can adapt to a dynamic world. Such a garden or maybe even wild meadow evolves and adapts to circumstances. This is in contrast to a much more static approach of growing hot house tomatoes. The hot house is highly regulated and creates ideal circumstances for the tomato to grow. But these ideal circumstances are not reflective of the real world. Hot house tomato’s are not resilient.</p>
<p>Reminds me a bit of legibility and <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Seeing_Like_a_State_by_James_Scott">Seeing Like a State by James Scott</a> but applied to children. Authoritarian High modern failure mode in kids is one that tries to carpenter too much. I have examples of this in distant friends: MA rebelled against becoming a doctor, IN rebelled against becoming a software engineer. Both results were disappointing to their parents. Better to not be so prescriptive.</p>
<p>(Does this idea of parent-gardener break down if you consider a very large garden? I guess if garden is large enough you end up with parent-industrial farmer. Is that what school is then?)</p>
<h1>Against parentING</h1>
<p>I appreciated the more philosophical bent, especially as compared to other parenting books. But the narrative sometimes bent towards a pedantic but still an insightful critique of “parenting” especially as a goal driven activity. You don’t go around “friending” people, offspring are never “childing” you and your spouse is not usually “wifing” you. Gerunds have their place though.</p>
<p>Other relationships offer an interesting parallel: you don’t think you are a successful friend if they have become successful. Nor do you become a successful husband by profoundly improving your wife.</p>
<p>Many observations framed as paradoxes. Sounds more like tensions to me. Tensions between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal education and play</strong>, which itself leads to education but in roundabout illegible ways. (Makes me think of my work and when I’m happiest. It’s when I’m playing. Building toys. Playing to learn.</li>
<li><strong>Explore vs exploit</strong>. Since childhood kids want to be independent but also seek out the comfort of their parents. The same is true over a lifecycle, going from profound dependence to the opposite extreme. Similar tensions around Tradition and innovation. More on this in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Explore_vs_exploit_trade-offs">Explore vs exploit trade-offs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamentally, <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Open-endedness_is_required_to_solve_ambitious_problems">Open-endedness is required to solve ambitious problems</a>. Play and childhood are optimized for this.</p>
<h1>Recent changes parents and society</h1>
<p>Historically, humans live grown in large, multigenerational families. Most have the opportunity to help raise siblings Or cousins before becoming parents. Once parents, their kids are raised in large party but extended family.</p>
<p>Families growing smaller. More mobility. Having kids later in line after more education. Many new parents don’t have any expertise with kids at all.</p>
<p>“Parenting” builds on this gap in knowledge and caregivers. It’s profits from the expectation of educated people that things are learned through books.</p>
<h1>Analogy to dieting</h1>
<p>Referencing Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan. What was formerly a traditional way of being, like cooking meals from a certain cuisine, was replaced by a sort of science-inspired explosion of dieting advice. The more we deliberately cook and eat to become healthy, the less healthy we become.</p>
<p>The more we raise children to make them happy and successful adults the less happy and successful they become. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Trying_not_to_try">Trying not to try</a></p>
<p>The sheer quantity of parenting and dieting books itself is just an indication that none of them work. If one did, they’d all be out of business. This critique reminds me of the one in <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Two_Watersheds_-_too_much_institutionalization">Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization</a>.</p>
<h1>Generational compounding</h1>
<p>If a child is slightly better at using a tool, this advantage is slightly conferred to their offspring. And the effect compounds. Children's brains are the largest of all animals and our childhoods are the longest. Largely this is to have more time to develop and grow a brain, which is extremely plastic so that it can adapt maximally to its cultural milieu.</p>
<p>Birds are categorized as either precocial or altricial, depending on their capabilities at birth.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Precocious birds</strong> are capable of moving around on its own soon after hatching. They develop early and are pretty dumb. Examples: chickens, geese, and turkeys.</li>
<li><strong>Altricial birds</strong> are basically useless at birth. They hatch with eyes closed, fully depend on the parent, and cannot even leave the nest on their own. Examples: crows, herons, owls, and woodpeckers.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our minds can change rapidly… in just a few generations!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Evolution: why do women live past menopause?</h1>
<p>Most mammals die before they reach menopause.</p>
<p>Gopnik, a grandma herself, produces a strong argument in defense of grandmas. Post-menopausal grandmothers are evolutionarily advantageous because they allow their children to have more offspring despite the high maintenance and long childhood of each grandchild. By providing more childcare, the grandmother helps scale her genetic impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t care about children because we love them. We love them because we care for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a reinforcing feedback loop.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by this idea of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Catholic_Age_of_Reason_is_7">Catholic Age of Reason is 7</a>. Clearly the long childhood has become much longer in recent generations.</p>
<h1>Maybe against evo psych?</h1>
<p>Gopnik presents a convincing critique of evolutionary psychology. So much of being a human is embedded in our culture that it’s unclear that insights from the Pleistocene are applicable without lots of caveats. She also draws on the vast variety of behaviors exhibited by other primates. Gorillas are very aggressive and organize in harems, bonobos are very promiscuous and enjoy free love.</p>
<p>But then almost in the same breath, she proceeds to refer to a lot of evolutionary psychological studies, such as an interesting explanation of why post-menopausal women make sense from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<h1>In favor of apprenticeships</h1>
<p>More evo-psych studies in which Gopnik makes an ultimate argument against schooling and in favor of the traditional master-apprentice model. There's a bunch of social psychology studies and half of them sound a little bit dubious. It's also often unclear how they relate to the thesis the book.</p>
<p>Young children naturally imitate adults, under certain conditions: that the adult seems to be confident, that they have a good track record of success, that the adult is not a robot, etc.</p>
<p>Kids also over-imitate, which is to say they will repeat additional actions of the adult even if they appear to be superfluous. Does this natural inclination of over-imitation explain rites that carry over almost verbatim l'dor v'dor? TRADITION!!</p>
<p>And so, argues Gopnik, imitation based learning is a super good foundation for the master-apprentice model. Lots of critiques of school a la <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Deschooling_Society_by_Ivan_Illich">Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich</a>. There's also the historical argument, that the master-apprentice model is how people have learned for a long time.</p>
<p>Grad students are often professor apprentices, learning to write and getting critiqued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For most of our history, children have started their internships at age 7, not 27”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Good argumentation techniques</h2>
<p>Gopnik describes a thought experiment in which baseball is taught as if it were part of the core school curriculum. Students would begin with history of the game, introduction to running, then dive deeply into ball and bat construction, and those that get accepted into a Masters in Baseball might get to play some softball in the last few months of their degree.</p>
<p>Great (apocryphal) story about the master swordsman who forced his pupil to cook his food. But would show up randomly in the kitchen and smack his apprentice with a wooden sword. After three years of this the apprentice became always vigilant. Full legend is <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_Taste_of_Banzo's_Sword">The Taste of Banzo's Sword</a></p>
<p>Effective passage on "the device", which is reads like a Tristan Harris-style attack on smartphones, social media, or insert_bogeyman_here. She then reveals that it's actually about books, which were similar criticized by Socrates. This is a good reminder about generational conservatism, and made me feel more inclined to pursue far future technology with questionable social implications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day before you were born always looks like Eden, and the day after your children were born always looks like Mad Max.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Play is fundamental</h1>
<p>Interesting that children seem to seek out evidence that contradicts their theories as part of play.</p>
<p>Play must be spontaneous. The <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Ms._Havisham_Problem_illustrates_that_play_must_be_spontaneous">Ms. Havisham Problem illustrates that play must be spontaneous</a> is a good framing of why, citing Dickens' book where a disgruntled old lady asks a child to play for her entertainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am tired," said Miss Havisham. "I want diversion, and I have done with men and women. Play." I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Play must be spontaneous and is demonstrably more effective than teaching in some cases. Gopnik cites a study where children were either 1) shown how a multifunctional toy works, or 2) allowed to discover the functionality for themselves. Children shown how to play with a toy did not tend to discover other novel ways of playing with it while those that were allowed to explore ended up discovering more functionality. (Surely this depends on how much functionality was demonstrated in 1).</p>
<p>(Gopnik does not explicitly say this but I really like the idea that <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Play_is_deliberate_practice_for_wicked_problems">Play is deliberate practice for wicked problems</a>)</p>
<h2>Why is play fun?</h2>
<p>Why is sex fun? Evolution made sex fun so that people and animals would do it and propagate our genes.</p>
<p>Why is play fun? Evolution made play fun so that people and animals would learn how to world works experientially. (All of this flies in the face of the earlier critique of evopsych?)</p>
<h1>A grab bag of ideas</h1>
<p>The books flows reasonably well, but some pieces feel more like a side show than a coherent part of the gardener vs carpenter thesis.</p>
<p>Gopnik makes a bunch of observations like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A study shows correlation between standardized testing and ADHD diagnosis. I guess this is vaguely a result of excessive carpentry?</li>
<li>Puberty apparently happens at a younger age today than historically? Super weird hypotheses, including Artificial light and Sedentary lifestyle.</li>
<li>Points to increases in absolute intelligence over time (IQ scores are set so that 100 is the average). This is the Flynn effect. Gopnik speculates that increasing IQ is in tension with finely honed and focused expertise.</li>
</ul>
<h1>My critique: consider ergodicity</h1>
<p>Most gardens have hundreds of plants growing in them. But your average kinder garden only has 2.5 kinders, and every parent wants to do everything in their power to help them thrive. Even in a garden with hundreds of plants, it's hard to really understand what works and what doesn't. With an N of O(1), you certainly don't want to experiment and risk failure. So people take the safe path, another example of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Cover_Your_Ass">Cover Your Ass</a>.</p>
<p>This is my fundamental criticism of the Gardener model of parenting. In other words, I am identifying the core challenge to the parent. If Gopnik is indeed right, and the gardener model is the one to adopt, it is difficult for ambitious parents to do this in practice, because they are so invested in their child's future and be subject to competitive parenting, etc.</p>

      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>An excellent ending to a worthwhile trilogy on Medieval History. Also see <a href="/books/early-middle-ages">Early
Middle Ages</a> and <a href="/books/high-middle-ages">High Middle
Ages</a>.</p>
<h1>Franks and Popes</h1>
<p>The papacy was not doing so hot in the late middle ages. Cardinals routinely failed to agree in the next pope. In one incident, a famous hermit criticized them harshly for being so petty and squabbling. In response the cardinals decided to appoint him as pope Celestine V. He held the position reluctantly and then decreed in a papal bull that popes can resign, and promptly did so. His power hungry successor Boniface VIII imprisoned him to prevent his potential return, and Celestine V died in prison.</p>
<p>Phillip the Fair (Phillip IV), king of France around the 13th century, had a falling out with the pope reminiscent of the Teutonic rulers of prior centuries. The difference here is rather than succumbing to papal power he thwarted it successfully so that future popes knew not to mess with French kings. After threatening to excommunicate Philip IV and issuing a papal bull suggesting explicitly that popes trumped kings, Philip IV's royal troops captured Pope Boniface VIII, imprisoned him, beat him badly. The Boniface VIII died a month later and his successor Clement V was pressured to move the papacy to France.</p>
<p>Crusaders that remained in the holy lands after the crusades formed Crusader States. One such order, The Knights Templar defended Christian Jerusalem from Arab reconquest. They were monk-knights who helped other crusaders. The Knights Templar grew rich from donations from Christians who wanted to keep the holy city in their grasp. They grew unpopular after losing Jerusalem to Saladin and amassing great wealth.</p>
<p>Phil IV decided to pursue the Templar order, prosecution was also likely a money grab. He also expelled the Jews and annexed their property. <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Expelling_Jews_is_historically_a_great_way_for_kings_to_get_rich_quick">Expelling Jews is historically a great way for kings to get rich quick</a>. The pope initially condemned the mass Templar arrest but then when they confessed under torture, the pope called for other European kings to also arrest their Templars under papal authority. Papal palaces we’re built in Avignon. Subsequent popes were selected from the population of southern France.</p>
<h2>Papal Schism</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, pressure mounted for the Papacy to return to Rome. Popes were the spiritual successors of St. Paul, bishop of Rome. If they weren't in Rome that legacy was undermined. Urban VI was then selected under pressure from Roman citizens who rioted in demand of an Italian pope. The cardinals presented the masses with a pope of Italian origin but years later the French cardinals reneged and appointed another pope, Clement VII. He ruled in Avignon. As a result, there were two active popes at this time, and this period is referred to as the Western Schism aka Papal Schism (not to be confused with the East-West Schism aka Great Schism).</p>
<p>France and it’s allies like Scotland were generally in favor of the pope in Avignon. But sometimes there was a split in a single city and there were two bishops, each loyal to the French and Italian pope respectively.</p>
<p>It was thought that once one of the popes died, the population would support the other and the schism would end. But when urban VI died, his followers appointed another successor in Rome. And then when Clement VII died, his followers appointed a new pope in Avignon.</p>
<h2>Conciliarism reform movement</h2>
<p>In response to this shitshow, the Conciliarism reform movement began. A high level church councils composed of bishops and other Catholic leaders met and passed judgement apart from, or potentially against, the pope. The council of Pisa in 1408 was organized by a few breakout bishops from both French and Italian sides. They hoped to appoint a new pope and depose the two existing ones. The appointed pope died a year later and was replaced by John XXIII, who was odious and widely hated. So now there were three popes.</p>
<p>The council at Constance succeeded in deposing John 23 for moral reasons. The pope in Rome was also convinced to step down. The council finally deposed the pope in France. The papal schism finally ended in 1407 when the Cardinals elected Martin V.</p>
<p>What followed was a disagreement between those in favor of church councils and those in favor of the old system. Subsequent councils were not well attended, little reason to do so since the schism had ended. Still council at Basel imposed a bunch of limitations on the church. They made a limit of 24 cardinals, no more than 8 from each country, and constrained the amount of money the papacy could collect from local churches.</p>
<p>(My synthesis of this is that overall, these turbulent times paved the way for the protestant reformation.)</p>
<h1>Hundred Years War</h1>
<p>The hundred year war was a long conflict, not a constant total war, but a series of skirmishes. Britain decisively won the important battles early on. (Lots of overlap with <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/The_Story_of_Medieval_England">The Story of Medieval England</a>). Joan of Arc had a decisive part to play, just when France was all but defeated and almost entirely under British control managed to incite a last ditch effort to reconquer.</p>
<p>One of the most violent years during the war was one in which there was no fighting between sides after the treaty of Brétigny in 1360. Mercenary armies hired by the warring kings began indiscriminately pillage for want of supplies. The result was chaos, death, and destruction. To remedy this failure mode, salaried standing armies were introduced around 1450. This was expensive but cheaper than the alternative. It also greatly strengthened royal power compared to that of the nobles since now the crown could rely more on a paid army rather than the decentralized feudal system or lords and vassals.
This was the first Christian standing army since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<h2>Critical invention: The Longbow</h2>
<p>The English first encountered the longbow in their wars with the Welsh. English Longbows emerged by the 100 years war contributed to their prowess against the French who relied heavily on knights. The original short bow didn't require much training to use, but packed almost no punch against a knight. Crossbows were then invented as an effective ranged weapon against knights but suffered from a slow firing rate. You could speed it up a bit by lying prone but doing this in the face of a charging knight was not prudent.</p>
<p>The Longbow took the best of both worlds: the force of its blow could penetrate armor and it didn't take ages to reload. This weapon gave the English their decisive victories against the French knight armies at Crécy, Poitiers and Agincourt.</p>
<p>The longbow wielded by hundreds of archers was a very effective way to deal with knights. And although unlike short bows, it requires training, fighting as a longbowman was far cheaper and easier than fighting as a knight. Now the peasant class had once again a reason to fight, and gain some leverage over the noble fighting classes.</p>
<p>The Hundred Years War and “Babylonian captivity” of the church in France occurred simultaneously, as did the Black Death.</p>
<h1>The Black Death</h1>
<p>Likely Bubonic Plague. 1347-1351 was period of greatest mortality.  Killed potentially 50% of people in Europe at the time. It came from the east via Italy, the main connection point to the Orient. Earlier and more southerly parts of Europe were the most affected, in some cases 75% of the population dying.</p>
<p>There wasn't a good understanding about the underlying reason for the plague at all, so other reasons were sought. As usual, Jews were blamed for the plague, leading to increased pogroms around this same era.</p>
<p>Around 1340 was a local maximum in European population. These levels were not seen again until the 17th century. Outbreaks of the plague still occurred, but became rarer and rarer.</p>
<p>!<a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Population_of_Europe_1300-1800.png">Population of Europe 1300-1800.png</a></p>
<p>Because of the huge depopulation, things looked quite different economically. Suddenly there was a labor shortage. Wages shot up 3-5x. Cost of food had decreased due to a reduction in demand. Land prices went down too. Wage laborers began to enjoy a very high standard of living.</p>
<p>Economically speaking, this was great news for the surviving poor, but bad news for the nobles. A variety of attempts were made by nobles to curtail these negative economic effects. Some tried to fix wages by law, which largely failed to overpower strong market forces. Others tried to bring back serfdom, effectively bringing back free labor. This was counter to the interests of the crown since serfs were in the jurisdiction of their lord, including for tax and legal reasons. This was resisted in the west, but for some reason in the east of Europe serfdom came back with a vengeance and lasted well into the 19th century, with second order effects into modernity.</p>
<h1>Freedom in East and West Europe</h1>
<p>In the early Middle Ages, Eastern Europe was the European frontier. Lords of the east could entice western serfs to move and settle in their domains in exchange for freedom. Thus early in the Middle Ages, the east had more free smallholders than the west.</p>
<p>After the plague, the dynamics shifted substantially. Western countries with historically stronger kings were not interested in supporting serfs, who would only strengthen nobles, paying tax to them and being subject to their courts.</p>
<p>Also, empowered peasantry in the west staged successful rebellions (The Jacquerie in France, English Peasant Revolt) against nobles that attempted to revive serfdom. England was especially ahead of the game in terms of personal liberties for the masses. After the Normal conquest, William the Conqueror and his line established unprecedentedly strong and centralized control over England. The Baronial revolts and early Magna Carta set the stage for more personal liberties, and a rule of law. The island had time to develop independently due to its distance from mainland Europe.</p>
<p>In the east however, a feudal, more distributed system controlled by nobles and weaker rulers meant that serfdom could be brought back in force. Toward the late Middle Ages, many peasants in the east were newly serfs, and very few in the west. Russian serfdom lasted well into the mid 19th century.</p>
<p>Feudalism is distributed and leads to bad outcomes for the masses. In general this is a good example of distributed not being always better than centralized from a consequential standpoint.</p>
<h1>Gone are the days of the knights</h1>
<h2>Pikes</h2>
<p>Infantry was becoming increasingly effective against knights around the 13th century. In Flanders, a knight army could be thwarted by to opening up water gates and flooding the whole plain. In the Scottish mountains, knights did not have a flat area from which to charge. More generally, effective anti-knight tactics were developed around this time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traps</strong>: Infantry would dig ditches, fill them with spikes and cover them with leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Pikemen</strong>: pikes were longer than lances, so would impale a knight before they would impale the pikeman. Armies of pikemen would dig their pike's dull ends into the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Halberds</strong>: The Swiss developed the halberd, a spear with an axe and hook. You could use it as a pike, and/or use the hook to pull the knight off his horse, and/or split him in twain with the axe. It’s sort of a Swiss Army knife, so to speak. The halberd could also be used offensively in phalanx-like formations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cannons</h2>
<p>Gunpowder was developed initially in China, where it was used as a shock weapon. Early European cannons were also useful only for shock tactics as well, being very loud and scary to those that heard it in the battlefield. But they were not at all effective at hitting their targets, and accidents often resulted in the death of the canon crew. Still, the Europeans were more persistent and continuously refined the cannon to eventually make a very effective siege weapon.</p>
<p>The development of the canon with especially devastating for knights and other lords since it meant that their castle at home was no longer as impregnable.</p>
<p>Each cannon was initially given a name, much like Trebuchets, one named Malvoisin ("bad neighbor"). It's interesting what war equipment is given names, and which is not. Trebuchets, early Cannons. Ships are always named. Why aren't planes? What about tanks?</p>
<p>At the start of the hundred years war, cannonballs were made out of large stone boulders. These were rounded out by hand, and inevitably ended up with irregularities which would greatly reduce accuracy. Even if the stone cannonball hit the wall, it would shatter on impact. Around 1430, stone cannonballs were replaced with cast iron cannonballs which were much more spherical and much  more devastating on impact.</p>
<p>Castle design reacted to the invention of cannon. Walls became lower and thicker. Square towers rounded out and became cylindrical. Towers became the same height as walls, to allow artillery on the walls to more easily move into position.</p>
<h2>Arquebusiers and musketeers</h2>
<p>Personal firearms were less effective than cannons during the middle ages. The earliest resembled broomsticks with a small cannon on the end. The arquebus was developed in the early 15th century and it was a functional precursor to the musket. This weapon proved effective against knights at the Battle of Pavia, just like the longbow at Agincourt.</p>
<p>The combination of pikemen and musketeers was an especially formidable force against knights. Knights really hated Musketeers especially (nice backstory on the whole Three Musketeers plot). Even heavier plate mail was developed to try to defend against musket balls. Some inroads were made, but ultimately these full-plate suits were so heavy that they were impractical.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a result of so many forces working against nobles, many are forced to take paid employment, either at the court of a more powerful noble or at the court of the king. This marks the rise of courtiers. This cultural shift replaces the ideal of the chivalric knight. Now, nobles are expected not to ride a horse and save ladies, but to be nonchalant royal advisors capable of performing music and reciting poetry. Presumably all while still fulfilling duties of their job for which they were hired?</p>
<h1>Printing press and related inventions</h1>
<p>Although the printing press is by far the sexiest invention required for broader production of printed books, other breakthroughs were required in writing materials, advances in script, and book style. Daileader does a good job emphasizing this.</p>
<h2>Papyrus-parchment-paper</h2>
<p>Papyrus was the earliest writing material, made of a water plant that grows in abundance in the Nile river delta in Egypt. It emerged around 3000 BCE and the Egyptians controlled it fully.</p>
<p>Parchment is another writing material made of animal skins. It may have emerged as early as 1500 BCE, but is named after the King of Pergamum (пергамент) in Asia Minor around 100 BCE. It was developed in response to the cessation of Egyptian papyrus exports. The process was of making parchment was quite intense, requiring animal skins to be stretched over a frame, cleaned fully of fat, then dried. The rougher exterior side of the skin could serve as a book cover. The whiter interior was used to write on.</p>
<p>Parchment was expensive to produce, and as a result was often reused. Old scrolls would just be cleaned up, with ink removed, and then use it again to create anew. Vellum was a fancier, whiter variant of parchment. The highest grade required killing a pregnant sheep and her unborn calf, and then creating the parchment from the calf's skin (aka Chickenskin).</p>
<p>Towards the late middle ages, paper production was imported from China. This was much cheaper than parchment and the necessary condition for democratizing books.</p>
<h2>Advances in script</h2>
<p><a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Carolingian_minuscule">Carolingian minuscule</a> was commonly used around the time of the early middle ages. One problem with this script was that it was quite rounded and laborious for scribes to produce by hand. So scribes created a more efficient writing style called now called Gothic script. This had the benefit of being mostly vertical, so easieir to write because of a predominantly unidirectional motion of the arm. An added benefit was that the script was more compact, so more text would fit on one page.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, handwritten script with ligatures was revived from classical antiquity. Later, in an attempt to disavow of anything middle age related, scholars shunned gothic script and reverted back to minuscule, not realizing that it too was a middle age invention (c. 9th century)</p>
<h2>Book style</h2>
<p>During the early Middle Ages books were extremely large and heavy, requiring a pedestal to support. Books tended to get smaller over time, some were soon small enough to fit into a pocket.</p>
<p>Further inventions in readability were introduced: indices, tables of contents.</p>
<h2>Printing press precursors</h2>
<p>Woodcut prints allowed the artist to create multiple copies of his artwork. This required more effort than simply sketching with ink and paper, since the work needed to be etched into wood. But then once the wooden etching was created, you could create hundreds or thousands of impressions. The problem with wood was that it wore out overtime. Handcrafted metal blocks were also attempted, and this was obviously even harder than making a wood block.</p>
<p>Another challenge with wood blocks was that the stamped image would sometimes be unevenly produced, either because part of the wooden block had deteriorated, or there was some uneven application of ink, or uneven pressure. Furthermore, doing two-sided prints of woodblocks was impossible using this technique, since producing the imprint on one side would create an extrusion on the other side.</p>
<h2>The printing press</h2>
<p>Gutenberg's printing press combined two prior inventions: the wine press for evenly transferring ink from source to target, and movable metal type. A printer would typeset a whole page, make many copies of it, then move on to the next page. The end result were many copies of a printed book.</p>
<p>Metal typesetting was known in Asia, but never combined with wine style presses. Compared to Asia, Europe had other important advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>European alphabets are phonetic and have fewer than 30 symbols. In contrast, Asian alphabets are mostly ideographical and have thousands of symbols.</li>
<li>Chinese printing presses were state run, and as a result mostly Confucian classics were produced. In Europe the printing press was subject to the free market, and thrived.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second order impacts of the printing press were huge:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spread of knowledge in general. Nuff said!</li>
<li>Errata could be issued in bulk, since many books were now identical and issued in editions.</li>
<li>Ossification of English spelling. Previously spelling was pretty variable. This is especially annoying since the great vowel shift followed shortly thereafter, rendering English spellings nonsensical.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Humanism in Late Medieval Europe</h1>
<p>The humanist movement arose in 14th century Italy as part of the Italian Renaissance. Humanists aimed for a revival of classical art and literature, and following Petrarch, viewed the preceding centuries as a dark and lost age of regression. (Interesting to see how the “first industrial revolution” from <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Medieval_Technology_and_Social_Change">Medieval Technology and Social Change</a> framing conflicts with this). They were headquartered largely in Florence where the recently founded university had not yet been fully oriented toward the scholastic tradition which was ubiquitous everywhere else. Florence at the time was extremely rich, minting the Florin, the first gold coin Europe had seen in almost a millennium.</p>
<p>Unlike medieval artists and authors, humanists signed their work and strive for a sort of secular immortality by living on in the minds of their peers after their inevitable death. That said, humanists were still deeply entrenched in the Christian tradition. This was not yet the enlightenment, nor the reformation, nor the scientific revolution.</p>
<h1>Christians and Muslim conflicts in the late middle ages</h1>
<p>The Byzantine empire stood valiantly for a millennium longer than its western roman counterpart. Its land holdings empire ebbed and flowed from assailants from all around, sometimes shrinking to little more than Constantinople itself. By the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks finally conquered the impregnable city of Constantinople and officially ended the Byzantine empire.</p>
<p>This was seen as a huge loss, especially from a humanist lens. The whole Greek trove of knowledge was lost to Christendom for eternity! In practice, by then much of this trove of classical Greek culture had been assimilated by the west, through translation, and through a revival of Greek language, hearkening back to classical antiquity, when Roman elites were fluent in both Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>With the fall of the Byzantine empire, Europe was bracing for more incursions from their aggressive and powerful Turkish neighbors. Sure enough, the Ottomans even managed to conquer and briefly hold small parts of Italy. So it was welcome news that in Iberia, the kingdoms of Aragon and Castille had formed an alliance with the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, and they had set out to conquer Granada, the last Islamic state in the west. This was a culmination of many centuries of European reconquest of Al-Andalus, the Ummayad kingdom that formed from the ashes of the Visigoths, defeated in the 8th century. Spain was once a cultural melange of three religions, but F&amp;I were keen to homogenize their joint kingdom.</p>
<h1>The Spanish Inquisition</h1>
<p>Shortly after the defeat of Granada, jubilant Ferdinand and Isabella decided to kick it up a notch and the Spanish Inquisition swung into full force. Spain had previously not participated in the papal inquisition, and unlike the previous inquisitions which relied on inquisitors reporting to the pope, the Spanish inquisition was operated by the king and queen.</p>
<p>It's somewhat unclear why F&amp;I decided to force all Jews to convert or leave. Ferdinand had recently appointed Jewish courtiers whose contract was not due to expire for years. The reason given was that there were too many Christians converting to Judaism in Spain. In practice, anti-Jewish sentiment had been rising for decades, thanks to preachers like Ferrand Martinez, and the massacre in 1391 which led to 50,000 Jewish deaths and far more forced conversions.</p>
<p>In 1492, every Jew in Spain was given a choice: convert or leave. Those that converted to Christianity were called conversos. Some conversos even managed to secure bishoprics, but many were treated with suspicion by the masses, who suspected that many conversos continued to practice the Jewish faith in secret. Thus even if you converted from Judaism, you were still somehow Jewish, and this is the origin of Jewishness as a race, which permeates into modernity and foreshadows Jewish horrors of the 20th century. Furthermore, now that conversos were Christian, they were subject to the inquisition, and those that were found guilty of heresy were burnt alive.</p>
<h1>Maritime technology in Iberia</h1>
<p>Back to technology: navigation and sailing ships, in the context of Iberian expansion and the age of exploration. The Iberian peninsula at the time was not split between Spain and Portugal, but between several rival kingdoms: Kingdom of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre, and the Kingdom of Portugal.</p>
<h2>The Caravel</h2>
<p>Shipbuilding technology was fairly stagnant until the 15th century. Here are a few common ship types before this period:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longships</strong>, aka galleys were powered by teams of rowers. They had to be light so that the men could propel it and it had to be long enough so enough men could fit inside. Because of the large crew, their provisions, and other constraints, these ships could not carry much cargo. Longships were short range and only used on the Mediterranean. Some longships had sails that would be raised in favorable downwinding conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Roundships</strong> often had a single mast with a square rigged single sail. They were large and bulky and slow, but could carry a lot of cargo. The square rigged sail meant you would mainly use the sail to go downwind, greatly limiting maneuverability.</li>
<li><strong>Lateen</strong> sailboats originated in the Nile, but were later used in the Mediterranean. These triangular sails could luff and generate lift using the sail as a wing, and move the vessel towards the wind. Lateen sails of the 14th century also tended to be quite small, so were not very effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of its geography, the Iberian kingdoms had exposure to both north Atlantic roundships, and ships with Lateen sails commonly used in the Mediterranean. The Caravel, invented by the Portuguese in the 15th century, combined both types of sails. Early designs had a front square rigged sail, and a rear lateen sail, allowing ships to zig-zag upwind, or run downwind depending on wind conditions.</p>
<h2>Other Iberian advantages</h2>
<p>The Iberian peninsula was extremely well situated geographically, in the far southwest of Europe, and thus the natural portal to west Africa. Furthermore, the Spanish had a great history of seafaring already and were notoriously brave sailors, willing to venture further than others in pursuit of fish and whales. Lastly, some of the best mapmakers of the age were based on the Balearic islands (Ibiza, Mallorca, Menorca).</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Portugal had the early upper hand. Portuguese Caravels were slowly traveling further and further south down the West African coast. Thanks to the funding efforts of Prince Henry the navigator, Vasco da Gamma finally reached the Cape of Good Hope. Meanwhile, F&amp;I were spending most of their disposable income on conquering Granada for the new Spanish alliance.</p>
<p>Portugal established footholds in many parts strategically located in Africa and far beyond. Distant ports included Goa off the coast of India, Macao off China, many of which remain to this day Portuguese territories. F&amp;I had attempted to loosen the Portuguese monopoly on the world, they were ultimately unsuccessful and in 1480 Ferdinand and Isabella granted a official monopoly to Portugal over a train with west Africa. Portuguese caravels were militarily superior and were very quickly able to destroy Arab fleets that previously controlled trade in the Indian ocean. The Portuguese king assumed a lofty title: Lord of the conquest and navigation of the ocean in India, Arabia, and Persia.</p>
<p>The Canary Islands were a bit of a revelation for Europeans that discovered them a new world that wasn't yet known to them, yet populated by people! Castilians first conquered the island and enslaved the local Guanches, the indigenous people of the islands. They died in huge quantities from the diseases the Europeans brought with them. Instead, the Spanish had to rely on imported west African slaves to run the plantations there. Why weren't west Africans subject to European diseases? Mainly because the cross-pollination between Europe and Africa. The European treatment of the Canaries established the model for colonization and served as a base for Columbus to venture further west.</p>
<p>Madeira and the Azores were uninhabited and discovered shortly after the Canaries. West African slaves were quickly imported there to establish the Sugar plantations as well as the Portuguese Madeira industry.</p>
<h1>The Columbian exchange</h1>
<p>Columbus had failed to convince the Portuguese king to fund his voyage, so pursued funding from Ferdinand and Isabella. The Catholic Monarchs were busy vanquishing the last remnants of Granada, it was taking longer than expected, and cost a fortune. They kept him on retainer for seven years, and only then committed to Columbus' voyage. Once he discovered what he called Asia but what was actually the New World, it was unclear who would own the territory.</p>
<p>Prior to the European discovery of America, The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the newly-discovered lands outside Europe between the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire (Crown of Castile), along an arbitrary meridian set by the Pope. This line happened to miss North America but cut South America in half, and explains why Brazil became a Portuguese territory (!).</p>
<p>One way to look at Columbus' discovery is as a large ecological event, in which previously diversifying and independent ecosystems  suddenly merged. If this is not the start of the Anthropocene, what is?</p>
<h2>Euro-American trade imbalances</h2>
<p><strong>Plants</strong>: a pretty good balance trade balance. Many critical crops from the New World corn and potato proved to be extremely important back in Europe. Other delicious new world plants included tomatoes, pineapples, peanuts, kidney beans, cashews, squash, sweet potatoes, avocado, chili pepper. And also druuuugs like coca and tobacco. And don't forget hammocks!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the New World saw a lot of new and critical crops from the east: sugar cane, bananas, coffee, wine grapes. Also onions, radish, and dandelions.</p>
<p><strong>Diseases</strong>: a big imbalance in favor of Europe. America had syphilis, and that's pretty much it. But the old world had loads of new diseases for the Americans, decimating their population.</p>
<p><strong>Animals</strong> a big imbalance in favor of Europe. America had very few pack animals: no cattle, pigs, sheep, or horses. Americans mainly had Turkeys and Llamas.</p>
<h1>End of Middle Ages</h1>
<p>Scholars can’t decide if 14th and 15th centuries are Middle Ages or renaissance. If you go to Italy at this period it’s the renaissance, otherwise it's the Middle Ages. One way to think about where to draw the line is what sort of things one could expect in the middle ages. Here are a few:</p>
<h2>Characteristics of the Middle Ages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hereditary kings.</li>
<li>Elites are nobles, basis in landowning and military dominance.</li>
<li>Small scale production in the home, commerce dominated by guilds designed to keep production low.</li>
<li>Bottom of society are serfs, liberties constrained.</li>
<li>Belief in god is universal, and the basis of all intellectual life.</li>
<li>Reverence for the past and skepticism for thinking from first principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this list, the Middle Ages continues well into the 16th century. Italian Humanists were trying to make a break from the past, but did nothing to eliminate nobility or serfdom, improve quality of life, or reform the guild system.</p>
<p>Daileader proposes a better potential endpoints to the Middle Ages, like the Scientific Revolution or the Protestant Reformation. But even these periods were rooted in the Middle Ages. Luther was a scholastic scholar following Aquinas' tradition. Newton was deeply religious. Perhaps an even better endpoint for the Middle Ages actually is the Enlightenment in the mid-18th century. The French Revolution was the antithesis to the Middle Ages and ushered in the drastic and abrupt end to many of the institutions central to the Middle Ages. (That said, the lecturer is a professor of Middle Age History, and is biased towards stretching the start and endpoints of his period of study.)</p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
      <div>
        <p>I'm clearly on a serious history of the Middle Ages kick. I found this book by just searching the internet inspired by earlier courses on Medieval history, and didn't really know what I was getting into. Apparently it's really famous and influential among Medieval scholars, even causing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stirrup_Controversy">Great Stirrup Controversy</a>.</p>
<p>This book was clearly written for academics. Latin and French quotes remain
untranslated, even in footnotes and endnotes. Yet somehow despite this, it is
engaging and readable.</p>
<p>It's great fun to try to integrate viewpoints on the same topic (Middle Age
Technology) and begin to start to fill in the gaps. One great benefit of
focusing on the Middle Ages is that there wasn't as much technology to speak of.
This helps focus in on fewer things, and constraints are good.</p>
<h1>History of Horses in Combat</h1>
<ol>
<li>Horse chariots, in which a two wheeled cart is used as a moving platform for combat.</li>
<li>Mounted archers and light combat on horseback.</li>
<li>Knights, using combined weight of horse, rider and armor.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Charles and the Knights</h1>
<p>Charles Martel and his descendants saw the potential of using horses for mounted shock combat. (White seems to ignore high backed saddles and the couched lance technique, with a shocking emphasis on stirrups.) Using armies of knights, Martel the Hammer defeated the Arabs and retook many lands, rebuilding a shorter lived spiritual successor to the Roman empire. With knights proving so effective, there was a need for more knights. This led to a vast proliferation of feudalism, enabling new upwardly mobile vassals to gain access to lands required of a knight, and ultimately cemented this new style of warfare. By 1000, the Latin "miles", which had meant soldier, began to mean knight.</p>
<p>White has a great discussion about the “diffusion” of stirrups. In general this lens of <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Diffusion_of_Technology">Diffusion of Technology</a> is one to keep in mind. I've adopted it in my random walk into <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Age_Heaping_Using_Canadian_1852_Census_data">Age Heaping Using Canadian 1852 Census data</a>. As White eloquently puts it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As our understanding of technology increases, it becomes clear that a new device merely opens a door; it does not compel one to enter. The acceptance or rejection of an invention, or the extent to which its implications are realized if it is accepted depends quite as much upon the condition of a society, and upon the imagination of its leaders, as upon the nature of the technological item itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Second_order_effects_and_unintended_consequences">Second order effects and unintended consequences</a> of this shift were massive. Horses were expensive to buy and maintain, armor was becoming heavier to be effective against lances with the force of thousands of pounds at its tip. Equipment for one knight seemed to cost about 20 oxen (a peasant family relied on 2). Knights often had squires, and multiple spare horses.</p>
<p>Charlemagne and other Carolingian kings encouraged peasants to band together and choose one of them to fight as a knight. Since land was the source of power of the time (money was not as key), the landed knights became the nouveau riche, creating a large gulf between them and the peasantry from which many of them came.</p>
<p>The old Germanic (nit: wasn't it the case in Rome too?) idea that every freeman was a soldier was now replaced by a professional fighting class.</p>
<p>Because of all the armor, knights became virtually unrecognizable and needed to develop some visual identification, and thus tradition of heraldry was born.</p>
<p>The cross bow emerged, either revived, or borrowed from the Chinese to penetrate knight's armor.</p>
<h1>Farming Practices</h1>
<p>Cross plowing was a technique to till tougher northern soil with a scratch plow. Furrows were made horizontally and vertically. This led to square fields. The moldboard plow, also known as the heavy plow eliminated the need for cross plowing because single furrows were deep enough for northern lands. It was also far more efficient. This made the fields long and narrow. (White does not mention the other reason for long fields: that ox teams were hard to turn.)</p>
<p>The heavy plow was wheeled and required an eight ox team. This required collaboration between peasants and led to closer ties and village councils. Large fields collectively owned were doled out to villagers in sequence. In contrast, southerners using scratch plows remained individualistic.</p>
<p>Diffusion of this technology was difficult and required a large population density. Another challenge was that collaboration was required between peasants to join plots together for this new farming practice.</p>
<p>Nailed Horseshoes were another key invention for agriculture. In Italy the warm climate worked well for unclod horses. But in the north, the climate and soil was such that horse hooves would often break.</p>
<p>The need for horses to carry more weight (armored knights) led to selective breeding of destriers. These stronger horses inevitably interbred with peasant farm horses, leading to stronger offspring.</p>
<p>Horses with padded collars could exert as much force as oxen. But moved much faster, so could output a lot more power. More speed let to more harrowing which was more effective at breaking up clods.</p>
<p>Yet the ox did not spread as quickly in England as one might expect. White suggests that this may have been because of a reluctance due to a lack of skin in the game, related to <a class="wiki" href="https://z3.ca/Does_your_output_affect_your_paycheck?">Does your output affect your paycheck?</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the real reason for his favoring the ox at the plow emerges when he remarks that 'the malice of the ploughmen does not permit a horse-drawn plough to go any faster than one pulled by oxen'. This kind of slow-down may have affected the ploughing of demesne lands done reluctantly under manorial obligation but it would not apply when peasants were working their own fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other benefit of switching to horses was that they could be used as transport. During Roman times, cost of goods doubled every 100 mi of overland transport. This meant that viable farmland was situated only along rivers. During Roman times, most vehicles were two-wheeled. The first horse-drawn four-wheeled wagons appeared by 13th century and reduced overland cost so much that transport over 100 miles increased by just 30% (a 70% savings). This expanded viable farmland further from rivers, allowed a lot more farmland, and increased overall carrying capacity.</p>
<p>Wagon inventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pivoted front axles</li>
<li>Adequate brakes</li>
<li>Whipple trees</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the horse, peasants didn't need to rely entirely on merchants, but could get their goods to market on their own.</p>
<p>Horses also gave them more mobility, and many were able to move to form larger settlements and benefit from amenities there: the commune, a church, a tavern, more suitors, markets, etc. Horse as transport enabled them to commute to their fields daily.</p>
<p>(This is all so interesting from the perspective of complex systems and feedback
loops...)</p>
<h2>Three field rotation</h2>
<p>First recorded in 763, this practice became ubiquitous by 800 (shockingly fast). Previously, Europe had practiced the two field rotation invented by Romans. The old system alternated two halves, with one planted, the other left fallow.</p>
<p>The three field system split holdings into three sub-fields. The peasant planted winter crops (winter wheat or rye) on field 1, then summer crops (oats, barley, lentil, etc) on field 2, and left field 3 fallow. Next year, fields do a circular shift.</p>
<p>This had many advantages over the two field rotation:</p>
<ul>
<li>2/3 land utilization during the year (vs. 1/2).</li>
<li>More crop variety means more resiliency to droughts.</li>
<li>Better yields since legumes fix the nitrogen in the soil.</li>
<li>Oats for horses! Oats are much more nutritionally rich than grass, allowing many more horses to work in agriculture.</li>
<li>A more even workload for farmers throughout the year.</li>
<li>Legumes provided extra nutrition for protein starved peasantry.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Mechanical power</h1>
<p>Mechanical power experiments were done in antiquity - e.g. with Hero's Aeolipile, a proto-steam engine. But inventions like these did not get refined and was never put to use at scale until the middle ages.</p>
<p>(Not mentioned in White's book, but it appears that labor was very cheap in the early middle ages, with agricultural slaves being common. Towards the high middle ages, slaves are replaced by serfs, and are then set free to work as smallholder farmers. The cost of labor goes up further after the population is decimated by the Black Death. All of this drives the demand for cheap power.)</p>
<h2>Water power</h2>
<p>Water mills became common around the 11th century. By this point the Vitruvian design had won out: a vertical wheel that turned a horizontal shaft. Earlier designs used a horizontal wheel and a vertical shaft, but did not require gears. Domesday reported that 5000 water wheels were in place for 3000 villages, circa 1086. Tidal wheels were also used, with some early examples on the Adriatic.</p>
<h2>Wind power</h2>
<p>Wind power was originally harnessed in Tibet and China where mantras written on scrolls were placed on bookshelves which rotated by power of wind to increase their holiness. Windmills in Europe spread quickly. They could produce less power than water mills, but do not require a strong river flow. Also, they are immune to rivers freezing in winter or drying up in fall.</p>
<p>Applications of this mechanical power included mostly milling grain but also filling cloth, sawing wood, crushing olives, operating bellows for blast furnaces, turning grindstones to polish metal, mincing paper pulp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The late Middle Ages has indeed been described as a “medieval industrial revolution based on water and wind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting aside is that the Aelopile did have a direct application in the Middle Ages: a blower to keep fires oxygenated and burning more evenly called a sufflator.</p>
<h2>Pneumatic weapons</h2>
<p>Other pneumatic devices may have been inspired by a blowgun from Malay. This design was apparently appropriated by Arabs and eventually made its way to Europe around the middle ages. If you continue the logical chain, the idea of having a barrel and a projectile means that the simple blowgun was a precursor to the musket, as well as the steam engine. Succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cannon is not only important in itself as a power-machine applied to warfare: it is a one-cylinder internal combustion engine, and all of our more modern motors of this type are descended from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corned gunpowder was a major refinement I’d not heard of. http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2016/07/black-powder-vii-corned-powder.html?m=1</p>
<h2>Gravity-based weapons</h2>
<p>Gravity based mechanical machines. The trebuchet emerged sometime in 11th (?) century and greatly improved on the Roman catapults, able to hurl 300 lb stone 300 yards using a long 50 ft lever arm and a heavy counterweight. Massive improvement over the Roman stars, 60 lb stone 450 yards. In siege warfare the mass of projectile matters most.</p>
<h1>Mechanisms and mechanical engineering</h1>
<p>Cranks… not sure why this section feels so dull right now. This reader struggled through a long discussion about cranks and when they were invented. Apparently not until 10th century or so in Europe.</p>
<p>Okay but seriously, cranks are important as a precursor to the pistons and in general the conversion of reciprocating motion into rotation or vice versa. If the driving force is reciprocation, you end up with a significant dead zone to get through. This is solved with a compound crank (as in a two stroke engine) and aided by Flywheels, which don’t appear until 14th century. Tangentially related, I really enjoyed <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/internal-combustion-engine/">this marvelous interactive explanation on the internal combustion engine</a>.</p>
<p>Treadles, or foot pedals that drive a rotating mechanism, are first found in China around the 2nd century, and then in Europe around the 12th century. Spinning wheels use treadles but also use belt drive and multiple subsystems that run at different speeds.</p>
<p>Ultimately these increasingly sophisticated mechanisms enabled mechanical clocks, which involved many mechanisms rotating at different rates. Water clocks had been an improvement over sundials but had many shortcomings. For example, they didn’t operate in freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Was there a gravity-based alternative to water clocks? A trebuchet-like idea was used and eventually culminated in mechanical clocks in the 14th century. These clocks were extremely elaborate, less functional and more status symbols and statements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Giovanni's clock was only incidentally a timepiece. It included the celestial wanderings of sun, moon, and five planets. And provided a perpetual calendar of all religious feasts, both fixed and movable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrist watches were even trickier since they relied on springs which uncoiled and provided variable force during their uncoiling. These led to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoeP0adbDKg">escapement</a> mechanism, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/cpVkTSZrg_A?t=100">fusee</a>, both impressively complex mechanisms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no problem in mechanics has ever been solved so simply and so perfectly - Gawaine Baillie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s funny how underrated this time is from tech perspective, at least in the popular imagination. To me it feels like a veritable industrial revolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the four centuries following Leonardo, that is, until electrical energy demanded a supplementary set of devices, were less technologically engaged in discovering basic principles than in elaborating and refining those established during the four centuries before Leonardo.</p>

<h1>Perpetual motion</h1>
<p>All of these mechanical inventions were inspired by the ideal of a perpetual motion machine. This was not so outlandish pre-thermodynamics, given that windmills and water mills appeared to be moving perpetually. Perpetual motion through Gravity and magnetism became the holy grail.</p>
<p>Roger Bacon c. 1260 imagined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Machines may be made by which the largest ships, with only one man steering them, will be moved faster than if they were filled with rowers; wagons may be built which will move with incredible speed and without the aid of beasts; flying machines can be constructed in which a man... may beat the air with wings like a bird... machines will make it possible to go to the bottom of seas and rivers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wondered if король comes from Carolingian. Nope, it comes from Charlemagne. That said, apparently "Carolingian" and in fact Charlemagne are both named after Charles Martel. In turn, Charles is a name from the common Germanic noun meaning "man". Go figure...</li>
<li>Lots of references to Bayeux tapestry. It's <a href="https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/discover-the-bayeux-tapestry/explore-online/">available online...</a></li>
