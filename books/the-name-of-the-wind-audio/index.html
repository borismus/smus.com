  <meta name="description" content="I’ll admit, I only got about 20% through this book when I decided to abandon it.    I enjoyed the world building somewhat, but it felt like a really cut-and-dry Tolkien-esque fantasy book without much originality. I’m not sure why it seems to have such great critical acclaim. The character development is what I found weakest. The protagonist Kvothe (perhaps from Kavod?) seems to just be perfect at everything, and the complete center of attention. None of the other characters feel at all developed.      This review  seems to mirror my sentiments directly. Enough said." />
