  <meta name="description" content="He's way too simple in his breakdown. The two family views is ridiculous. It's not fucking binary. People have much more granular and specific world views. Cambridge analytics showed that very well with both Brexit and Trump.  Very dated. Lots of 2000s era references that are no longer relevant, like Schwarzenegger. Also a very political message, never giving conservatives a steel man.    I forgot the book on a plane. But I won't be attempting it again despite its short length." />

      <p>He's way too simple in his breakdown. The two family views is ridiculous. It's
not fucking binary. People have much more granular and specific world views.
Cambridge analytics showed that very well with both Brexit and Trump.  Very
dated. Lots of 2000s era references that are no longer relevant, like
Schwarzenegger. Also a very political message, never giving conservatives a
steel man.</p>
