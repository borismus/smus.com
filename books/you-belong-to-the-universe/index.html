      <p>Buckminster Fuller's name seems to pop up everywhere in the last few years. I
saw Jonathon Keats talk at The Interval a few years ago, on a book tour about
Fuller's life and work. I finally got to listen to the audio version. I found
bits to be interesting, but overall this book is less of a biography, and more
of an attempt to riff on various modern incarnations of Fuller's ideas. Fuller
himself comes off as overly self-involved. His investment and belief in panacea
projects like the World Game, Domed Manhattan, Dymaxions comes off as overly
naive for such a great man.</p>

<p>The book itself is interesting but not groundbreaking. It involves overly
flowery descriptions of things that I consider obvious: Google, Nest, Sim City,
self driving cars, etc. The end appears especially weak. The author spends too
much time on platitudes about specialization. If I had a dollar for every time
he wrote “comprehensive anticipatory design science”...</p>
