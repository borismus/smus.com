      <p>Culture, the dominant empire in the known universe, is an interesting place.
People have fully tamed their hormones, able to secrete anything at will, change
genders, heal wounds. Machines and humans co-exist with mutual respect. Tiny
drones and intergalactic starships are independent, intelligent entities with
personality. Humanity has broadened: it's not just homo sapiens, but many many
other kinds of humanoids from all sorts of different planets. Mysterious
superintelligent Minds (presumably machine) that seem to run the system. How
does Culture interface with other civilizations?</p>

<p>This book is definitely a page turner: great story telling, with an air of
mystery throughout.</p>
