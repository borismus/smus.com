      <p>Each short story explores a novel premise that is vaguely science-fictiony. But
Le Guin's writings favor soft over hard sci-fi, rarely delving into Asimovesque
"gadgeting", mostly focusing on the romantic: emotions, relationships, feelings.
Some of my favorites from the book:</p>

<p>April in Paris: interesting fantasy/sci-fi exploration of the same place over
time. It gets a bit silly in the end, but very memorable. Her obsession with
archaeology is very apparent. </p>

<p>The Masters: the intersection between religion and technology is just always
fascinating. Reminded me a bit of one of my favorites: Canticle for Leibowitz</p>

<p>The Rule of Names: riffing on an interesting premise: nobody is allowed to
reveal your name to anyone. Pure fantasy with wizards.</p>

<p>Nine Lives: what happens when you grow up with/as a group of clones? What's it
like? How do you(s) interact with the world and others? What happens if your
group is split? Fascinating premise and great execution.</p>

<p>Some of her other stories are much less focused on a sci-fi premise, and more
focused on a mental trip and human psychology. She calls them psychomyths. </p>

<p>The Good Trip: close to my heart at the moment, as I worry about my life and
wife. I didn't realize Le Guin was from Portland. How cool!</p>

<p>A Trip to the Head: what if you lost your identity completely (terrifying), but
had the ability to pick one arbitrarily? Not particularly good, but reminded me
of some vague but unpleasant thoughts I had about VR.</p>

<p>I wonder if sf writers write with their future audience in mind. Like how would
their books read after we actually have become an interplanetary species?"</p>
