  <meta name="description" content="An impressively comprehensive series of 36 half-hour  lectures on political philosophy . I wanted a political philosophy survey to better understand some of the political articles I've been reading in Foreign Affairs, as well as have a better sense of context for the current moment.   The lecturer, Lawrence Cahoone, is an engaging speaker, and organized the material really well. He goes chronologically through some of modernity's most influential political philosophers, and summarizes their most important ideas. I found that Cahoone was able to summarize the philosophers I was familiar with pretty succinctly, although of course it's very hard to avoid oversimplification. I was also surprised by how many thinkers I hadn't even heard of.   This was not an easy course to follow for a layperson like me. I found myself having to re-listen to some of the more dense lectures multiple times before I felt like I grasped the concepts. Some philosphers remain shrowded in mystery. Most notably, Hegel and Strauss continue to defy summarization. In the latter lectures, he does a great job of tying more modern and controversial ideas surrounding feminism and multiculturalism back to older thinkers.   Here are some of the philosophers he covers, as well as brief summaries for me to index on later. As a note to myself, here are ones that I thought were most interesting, and would be worth delving into in more depth: Carl von Clausewitz, Alexis de Tocqueville, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Leonard Hobhouse, Hannah Arendt, Friedrich von Hayek, Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre, William Galston, Michael Waltzer, Carol Gilligan, Charles Taylor, Aldo Leopold, Jürgen Habermas, Benjamin Barber, Ernest Gelner. What follow are a survey of a survey, brief notes on each philosopher that was mentioned in the course.   Formation of Liberal Republicanism (Lectures 3 - 16)     Plato - we need a philosopher king.   Machiavelli - Realpolitik. Politics is amoral. The enemy of my enemy is my   friend.   Hobbes - the state of nature is a war of all against all. In the social   contract, you give up rights for security. (Social contract)   Locke - people have natural rights to life, liberty and property. The   government isn’t your master, it’s your servant. (Liberty)   Rousseau - the noble savage was better off than the modern man because   everyone was equal. Independence, equality and community are most important.   "Man is born free yet is everywhere in chains". (Equality)   Kant - morals are derived from reason and not experience. And you must always   act according to the categorical imperative. Kant is a non-consequentialist,   outcome doesn’t matter. (Deontology)   Adam Smith - self-interest can be good. The invisible hand guides private self   interest to create public benefit. (Emergence, Markets)   Montesquieu - checks and balances will prevent despotism. Separate powers into   legislative, executive and judicial branches. (Checks and Balances)   Jefferson - inherited wealth and inherited debt is bad for society.   Hamilton - too much federation is bad, leads to internal conflict. Feared   “Petty republics without any shared unifying purposes”. Centralize for   strength: banks, patent office, etc.   Madison - tyranny of the majority is real. States/communities should have   equal power in some sense (eg. electoral college, 2 senators per state)   Richard Price - the French rightfully replaced King’s with laws. In favor of   elections and explicit consent. (Republicanism)   Edmund Burke - England depends on traditional institutions: royalty, the   church.  Political norms don't come from reason but from tradition.   (Conservatism)   Thomas Payne - there is no power above the people other than god. Natural   rights exist, according to reason. Burke is irrational, tradition is bad.   Joseph de Maistre (far right) - nature is inherently evil. Man must submit   soul to god and body to the state. The order is not rational.   (Counter-enlightenment)   William Godwin (far left) - government coercion is bad. Moral individuality and   rationally derived conduct is good. (Anarchy)   Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (far far left) - there is no such thing as absolute   dominion. Property rights over indefinite timescale don’t make sense.   (Anarchy)   Leo Tolstoy - war and church are sources of violent coercion. Violence is   always evil even when monopolized by government. Logical continuation from   turning the other cheek from Christ. (Anarchic pacifism)   Johann Gottlieb Fichte - "For each people, a country, for each country, a   people". This means pan-German unification, mass literacy, etc. A sort of   celebration of diversity on a country level. (Nationalism)   Napoleon - The draft changed warfare forever. No more chivalrous knights,   fealty for the king and hired mercenaries. Just a 600k strong standing army.   (Conscription)    Carl von Clausewitz  - "War is the continuation of politics by other means".   "Real war" is ritualized, chivalrous, traditional. But "ideal war" is pure   conflict, fewer rules, objective is to make your opponents surrender. (War   theory)   Isaiah Berlin - negative liberty (freedom from x, liberty from coercion) vs   positive liberty (freedom to do y, self determination). Positive liberty means   there are multiple “goods”, requiring a pluralistic society.   Hegel - Everything has a thesis, a counter thesis, and then a synthesis   combining both. (Dialectic?)    Alexis de Tocqueville  - Traditional society gave aristocratic individuals   freedom, provided structures of mutual obligation. Modern citizens are   independent free and equal but alone so the government will have to do many   things that family, guilds, feudal structures did before. But in America this   can be mitigated with clubs, churches, other “civil society” outside of   politics. (Civil society)   Jeremy Bentham and James Mill - natural rights is “nonsense on stilts”, the   guiding star is general utility. And this means what people actually value   (from experience, not kantian intuition). Bentham: “push-pin (a children's   game) is as good as poetry” (Utilitarianism)   John Stuart Mill - there is a hierarchy of pleasures. “It is better to be a human   dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a   fool satisfied.” Act to maximize total pleasure overall. Also the harm   principle: be free up to the point of harming others. Harm here   is specifically utilitarian (eg. affecting others concretely, ie. not eating   pork in private). Diversity of opinion is important, marketplace of ideas   brings us closer to the truth. (Liberalism)   Henry J. S. Maine - the individual surpasses the family as the unit to which   law applies. (Individualism)   Eric Weil - loss of community is part of modernity in favor of a looser   association and voluntary groups.    Émile Durkheim  - Modern society is characterized by specialization.   Traditional society was fractal - every hunter gatherer group was the same,   now they vary. (Specialization)   Georg Simmel - Money dehumanizes.    Max Weber  - work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity   is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends.   Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to   a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an   all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)   Friedrich Nietzsche - "God is dead" and modern society is sick. What are the   values that increase the viability of a society? Definitely not equality,   since without ambition it turns mankind into a herd. Need Übermensch to   transcend the Judeo-Christian tradition by finding meaning in chaotic   modernity.   Sigmund Freud - people are still basically primitive and have drives that   contradict modern values. This leads to inevitable regressions like world war   1 and 2.  (Drive theory)     The Crisis of Liberal Republicanism from 1914 to 1953 (Lectures 17 - 20)      Leonard Hobhouse  - Laissez faire capitalism didn’t work and reduced the   world to “Manchesterism” - terrible industrial dystopia. Sought a softer mix   of liberalism and socialism. “Organic liberalism” is consequentialist, and   should improve society. People are inherently social, and any impact they have   must be reflected there. Communitarian, interactionist, prescient.   William J. Brian - empower the poor against the elites. Hallmark of populism   is railing against the economic hegemony and social   conservatism. (Populism)   Roosevelt - large monopolies have too much power. The wealthy few form a   tyranny of the minority. 3 C’s: consumer protection, control of corporations,   conservation of natural resources. A shift to more presidential/executive   power to reform the constitution and modernize it.   Wilson - again shift to more presidential power. Checks and balances are too   constraining. Political society is evolving.   Eduard Bernstein - capitalism will evolve to be more socialist organically,   and markets don’t need to be fully abolished. What’s important is that workers   are treated better. (Soft socialism)   Lenin - communism won’t come on its own. Bernstein is a political prostitute.   Communism needs a revolution and a hard line proletarian government that is   wholly dedicated to ushering the new era. Freedom isn’t possible until then so   all spheres of life, including art, must serve this goal. (Totalitarian   socialism)   György Lukács / Theodor Adorno / Max Horkheimer - capitalism lacks any   reference point from which to criticize it. It commodifies everything too   well. But despite western leanings they were quite sympathetic to Leninism.   “parliamentary democracy is like having a debate club at the edge of the   abyss.” The enlightenment wears away at beliefs, so all that remains is power.   Georges Sorel - True morality requires martial virtue, readiness for violence,   and self sacrifice. (Anarcho syndicalism)   Carl Schmitt - Fascism is an enlightened rationalist dictatorship. Politics is   above economics, morality, etc. Social contract theory is wrong. Even Locke   wanted there to be an emergency valve where the executive branch takes over.   But then the executive must also decide if there’s an emergency in the first   place. Ultimately it comes down to a non-rational decision. It’s a theological   politics. (Fascism)   Peter Drucker - Fascism is disappointed socialism. Need something less   international, less economic centric. Especially in light of standing armies   of WW1, nationalism is key, and there needs to be a  bigger   idea . (Nationalism)    Hannah Arendt  - totalitarianism of Hitler and Stalin is unlike anything   that came before. Total organization of society is mobilized for the state.   Nothing remains of civil society. No more art or chess for its own sake. She   characterized Nazis as banality of evil, just following orders while comma   unthinkable atrocities. (Totalitarianism) Distinction between labor, work, and   action:   Labor is recurring and pure maintenance: cooking, dishes, chores,     ephemeral output.   Work results in durable output: fixing the car, wiring poetry.   Action: deeds and speeches of free and equal individuals.     For Arendt, action &gt; work &gt; labor, but modernity focuses too much on economics   and so devalues work in favor of labor and action in favor of work. Powerful   argument against both capitalism and marxism framed in art. For capitalists,   the value of art is financial, for marxists, it's instrumental: for the sake   of advancing communism. For her, it's intrinsic. - Giulio Douhet - since so much depends on military technology, produced in   factories, factories and civilians are legitimate targets.   Political theory during the Cold War (Lectures 21 - 24)     Michael Oakeshott - political behavior cannot be deduced from rationalism alone.   Politics can be engineered and must be guided by practical knowledge. Great   analogy to recipes: you need cooking skills to make a great dish, not just   rule following.   Ludwig von Mises - a planned economy is actually impossible. It’s too complex.   Markets have emergent properties and no central planner can know it.   (Anti-communist)    Friedrich von Hayek  - Government should ensure equal rights but not equal   outcomes. Avowed anti-rationalist, believes in limitations of rationality, and   so spontaneous order created by multiple individuals. Markets are both good   and bad, you must have losers to have winners. The market must remain free,   but the losers can be propped up by the government. The market isn’t a   meritocracy, but based around value, or willingness to pay. Hayek is in   favor of free market regulation, for some domains: safety, sanitation,   breaking up monopolies, even health care. The worst is when prices, wages, and   production schedules are fixed by the government because it breaks emergent   spontaneity.   Milton Friedman - in favor of negative income tax or basic income. Opposed to   professional licensing run by governments. (Libertarianism)   Leo Strauss - Philosophy is fundamentally always inconclusive. Athens vs   Jerusalem: religion has all of the answers, but the ancient philosophers could   deal with the uncertainty of taking philosophy seriously.   Alexandre Kojève - history ended with Napoleon and Hegel. No more   qualitative changes in human thinking.   Herbert Marcuse - Advanced capitalism is totalitarian, integrating everything   into itself. Example: music that may have begun as counter culture like jazz,   hip hop, rock eventually gets played at the Super Bowl. In post capitalism,   work becomes play. “One dimensional man” was the Bible for the new left and   SDS of the 60s (New Left)     Domestic political arguments (Lectures 25 - 28)     John Rawls - what distribution of material wealth is just? Socialists usually   focus on outcomes, neoliberals on history. Rawls is a progressive deontologist.   Veil of Ignorance forces people to make ideal laws for a society without   knowing what their position will be. In this case, take the maximin approach:   best worst case. The only acceptable inequality is due to talent &amp; hard work,   not birth status. “Fair opportunity“. Difference principle: remove inequality   until it hurts the least advantages. Contrast to Pareto efficiency principle,   which doesn't care about individuals, but just overall outcome. (Fair   opportunity)   Ayn Rand - hates altruism from a Nietzsche perspectives. Selfishness is good   because people have value in themselves. So capitalism is the only moral   system of government. Society is only great in so far as it’s individuals are   great. In favor of minimal states: optional taxes for police and military.   (Objectivism)   Robert Nozick - Any distribution scheme is unjust because it requires too much   intervention to maintain. Inevitably people will gain a promotion or lose a   job, disrupting the distribution. Also you don’t owe anyone for your fortune   in life: analogy of musician who plays outside your house and then comes with   a bill the next day - you don’t owe them. The veil of ignorance is contrived.   It works for “life boat” cases and other emergency cases, but not in society   where how you got your money matters. Imagine living your life based on how   others want you to live, and you sell shares in your decisions. This is the   opposite of free society, some degree of slavery. (Libertarianism)    Michael Sandel  - Rawls and Nosick are wrong because some values are unchosen:   community, family, etc. the rest are chosen on top. In some cases, individual   liberty can impact community from which that individual liberty is partly   derived. Therefore some things should not become commodities to be bought and   sold: a mother child relationship, surrogacy, outsourcing child rearing etc is   wrong. (Communitarianism)    Alasdair MacIntyre  - Meaning can only be found in narrative, which is   based on the culture and community you belong to. He rejects modernism and   prefers premodern Aristotle to postmodern Nietzsche.    William Galston  - positive liberalism is important but is one of many   worthy values. He rejects moral monism (foxes &gt; hedgehogs) and thinks these   values are in general conflict. Ultimate values are: life itself,   purposiveness, instrumental rationality.    Michael Waltzer  - distributive justice is important but not why Rawls   thinks. A just distribution of a good depends on the good and cultural   conditions. Food, swimming pools, education are all different so distribution   should vary.  What is bad about income inequality? Tyranny of one type   of good over another: it’s that money can buy everything: security,   healthcare, better cars, sex, political influence, commutation (avoiding the   draft). It’s bad when different “spheres of justice” become too asymmetrical.   Free market rules only apply to the bazaar, but treating everything as commerce   ruins things.     Feminism, Multiculturalism, Environmentalism, Postmodernism (Lectures 29 - 32)     Susan Okin - progressive justice doesn’t take into account women’s special   rights. Women in reality make less, so no fault marriage is equal but unjust.   Wife beating is political in the same way that racially motivated crime is.   The private is political. Women are generally more focused on the private.   (Feminism)    Carol Gilligan  - normal development for humans is masculinized by society.   In fact women are fundamentally different (essentialist). Men think in terms   of rights and rules. Women focus more on care, community.   Iris Marion Young - identity is often construed as negative. Example: Who am   I? I’m not like this cis-gendered white male! Critical of negative identity   because individuals belong to many groups.    Charles Taylor  - all cultures deserve to be recognized but what is their   respective value? Should Shakespeare and Achebe get the same amount of   coverage in school? Cultures are of equal value is nonsensical, muzzles   critical powers.   Bhikhu Parekh - the majority culture should adjust to its immigrants. For   example, wearing a turban is a disadvantage for motorcycling, hence the Sikh   helmet exception law in the UK, which is just to normalize the disadvantage.   Brian Barry - individuals should not be disadvantaged by the groups they are   born into. The Amish must stop preventing their children from going to high   school. (Assimilation)   Will Kymlicka - in liberalism, a group has as much rights as the sum total of   rights of its individuals. But this doesn’t work for small groups like   indigenous tribes. This gets tricky if liberties undermine the culture of the   minority community. (Multiculturalism)   John Muir - preserve nature as it is because it is sacred. (Preservation)   Gifford Pinchot - conserve nature but still allow it to be used for human   purposes. (Managed Conservation)   Peter Singer - argues for animal welfare on a utilitarian basis. Their   suffering should be reduced wherever possible. Applies to mammals and probably   birds and amphibians. Speciesism is the analogue of sexism, racism etc.   (Animal rights)   Tom Regan - non human animals have deontological rights. They have an identity   and so have inherent value and rights. (Kantian animal rights)    Aldo Leopold  - animals eat one another in the wild, but we now have   control over ecosystems. We must "think like a mountain". This is a   communitarian approach often driven by the desire to keep biodiversity high.   (Moral ecology)   Richard Rorty - there is no non circular justification for any philosophical   argument. (Anti-foundationalism)   Jean-François Lyotard -  everything is mediated by culture, which   manifests as a series of signs. Beyond that, it’s all language games. (Radical   structuralism)   Michel Foucault - truth is defined by society and is intended for controlling   the people. Society has constructed its canon out of straight white men. This   is a problem, and blacks, women, and homosexuals need to be brought into the   fray. Biases inherent in western ideals, feminist, multicultural ideas are   all legacies. (Postmodernism)    Jürgen Habermas  - attempts to defend enlightenment and modernism from both   Nietzsche postmodernism and conservative premodernism. Expands notion of   rationality to communication. Kinds of rationality:   Epistemically rationality: what is true.   Instrumental rationality: rational action.   Communicative rationality (Habermas): we can decide together what we should     do. If what parties are saying is expressed dishonestly, it’s strategic     communication.     Democracy is all about communicative rationality. There is a conflict between   “the system” and the “lifeworld”, first of which is money and power driven,   second is democratic communicative action. System infringes on the life world:   less is decided conversationally and more moneyed.   Post cold war (Lectures 33 - 35)     Francis Fukuyama - History is about the slaves seeking and achieving equality   (Hegel, Kojev). We're well on our way now, and nothing will really beat   liberal democracy ever. Problem is that the end-state (universal equality) is   bad because it leads to Nietzches “last man”, an ambitionless passiveness. So   there must be room for individual thriving, or Thumos. (End of History)    Benjamin Barber  - We accidentally flooded the world with mcworld, the 3   Ms: McDonald’s, Macintosh, MTV, but not with the civil society requires for   democracy. “Neither Jihad nor McWorld promises a remotely democratic future”.   Model: Tocqueville. (Jihad vs. McWorld)   Samuel Huntington - Culture matters to how states govern.  Listen 9 modern   civilizations: Eastern Europe, greater China, Islamic belt, India, Japan, etc.   Conflicts will occur at the borders between these civilizations.  Western   culture is not replicable. Elements are exportable, but it won’t be a full   package. Globalism will increase tension and resistance because identity is   often constructed negatively. (The Clash of Civilizations)    Ernest Gelner  - airlifting free elections and market economy into Soviet   block countries isn’t sufficient. What you need is modern civil society, by   which he means a plurality of ideas: neither church, nor market, nor govt can   dominate. Life is modular and each part follows different rules. So pluralism   is key. In the West this loss of identity was OK because of nationalism. Most   countries are no longer Ideocracies (single moral idea, no pluralism) with the   exception of those dominated by political Islam.   Mahatma Gandhi/Martin Luther King - forceful non violent resistance but   inspired by Tolstoy. (Non-violent resistance)   William T. Sherman - open to war as needed. "War is hell". (War Realism)    Michael Waltzer  (this time on war) - War is sometimes justified but is   regimented by rules for going to war and then conduct during war. (Contrast to   Just War Pacifism, which thinks modern technology is too dangerous to ever   use.) Codified in Geneva and Hague conventions.  But tricky for civil wars:   are the rebels criminals (to be punished) or combatants (protected by Geneva)?   Terror against civilians is never ok, and tricky for combatants. Peacekeeping   is justified if the target country is no longer able to guarantee rights to   its people ("the right to have rights"). For example if there’s a genocide the   country is unable to protect its citizens or is complicit in the act and must   be stopped. Less clear who needs to intervene though. Dirty hands: politicians   cannot be deontologists but must consider the utilitarian outcome for their   people. (Just War theory)     This is a great overview of some philosophical underpinning of politics. I learned a ton, gleaming new things about philosophers I was already familiar with because of superior summarization, and learning about completely new philosophers I hadn't even heard of before. Well worth a listen, and a re-listen." />

A shift to more presidential/executive   power to reform the constitution and modernize it.   Wilson - again shift to more presidential power. Checks and balances are too   constraining. Political society is evolving.   Eduard Bernstein - capitalism will evolve to be more socialist organically,   and markets don’t need to be fully abolished. What’s important is that workers   are treated better. (Soft socialism)   Lenin - communism won’t come on its own. Bernstein is a political prostitute.   Communism needs a revolution and a hard line proletarian government that is   wholly dedicated to ushering the new era. Freedom isn’t possible until then so   all spheres of life, including art, must serve this goal. (Totalitarian   socialism)   György Lukács / Theodor Adorno / Max Horkheimer - capitalism lacks any   reference point from which to criticize it. It commodifies everything too   well. But despite western leanings they were quite sympathetic to Leninism.   “parliamentary democracy is like having a debate club at the edge of the   abyss.” The enlightenment wears away at beliefs, so all that remains is power.   Georges Sorel - True morality requires martial virtue, readiness for violence,   and self sacrifice. (Anarcho syndicalism)   Carl Schmitt - Fascism is an enlightened rationalist dictatorship. Politics is   above economics, morality, etc. Social contract theory is wrong. Even Locke   wanted there to be an emergency valve where the executive branch takes over.   But then the executive must also decide if there’s an emergency in the first   place. Ultimately it comes down to a non-rational decision. It’s a theological   politics. (Fascism)   Peter Drucker - Fascism is disappointed socialism. Need something less   international, less economic centric. Especially in light of standing armies   of WW1, nationalism is key, and there needs to be a  bigger   idea . (Nationalism)    Hannah Arendt  - totalitarianism of Hitler and Stalin is unlike anything   that came before. Total organization of society is mobilized for the state.   Nothing remains of civil society. No more art or chess for its own sake. She   characterized Nazis as banality of evil, just following orders while comma   unthinkable atrocities. (Totalitarianism) Distinction between labor, work, and   action:   Labor is recurring and pure maintenance: cooking, dishes, chores,     ephemeral output.   Work results in durable output: fixing the car, wiring poetry.   Action: deeds and speeches of free and equal individuals.     For Arendt, action &gt; work &gt; labor, but modernity focuses too much on economics   and so devalues work in favor of labor and action in favor of work. Powerful   argument against both capitalism and marxism framed in art. For capitalists,   the value of art is financial, for marxists, it's instrumental: for the sake   of advancing communism. For her, it's intrinsic. - Giulio Douhet - since so much depends on military technology, produced in   factories, factories and civilians are legitimate targets.   Political theory during the Cold War (Lectures 21 - 24)     Michael Oakeshott - political behavior cannot be deduced from rationalism alone.   Politics can be engineered and must be guided by practical knowledge. Great   analogy to recipes: you need cooking skills to make a great dish, not just   rule following.   Ludwig von Mises - a planned economy is actually impossible. It’s too complex.   Markets have emergent properties and no central planner can know it.   (Anti-communist)    Friedrich von Hayek  - Government should ensure equal rights but not equal   outcomes. Avowed anti-rationalist, believes in limitations of rationality, and   so spontaneous order created by multiple individuals. Markets are both good   and bad, you must have losers to have winners. The market must remain free,   but the losers can be propped up by the government. The market isn’t a   meritocracy, but based around value, or willingness to pay. Hayek is in   favor of free market regulation, for some domains: safety, sanitation,   breaking up monopolies, even health care. The worst is when prices, wages, and   production schedules are fixed by the government because it breaks emergent   spontaneity.   Milton Friedman - in favor of negative income tax or basic income. Opposed to   professional licensing run by governments. (Libertarianism)   Leo Strauss - Philosophy is fundamentally always inconclusive. Athens vs   Jerusalem: religion has all of the answers, but the ancient philosophers could   deal with the uncertainty of taking philosophy seriously.   Alexandre Kojève - history ended with Napoleon and Hegel. No more   qualitative changes in human thinking.   Herbert Marcuse - Advanced capitalism is totalitarian, integrating everything   into itself. Example: music that may have begun as counter culture like jazz,   hip hop, rock eventually gets played at the Super Bowl. In post capitalism,   work becomes play. “One dimensional man” was the Bible for the new left and   SDS of the 60s (New Left)     Domestic political arguments (Lectures 25 - 28)     John Rawls - what distribution of material wealth is just? Socialists usually   focus on outcomes, neoliberals on history. Rawls is a progressive deontologist.   Veil of Ignorance forces people to make ideal laws for a society without   knowing what their position will be. In this case, take the maximin approach:   best worst case. The only acceptable inequality is due to talent &amp; hard work,   not birth status. “Fair opportunity“. Difference principle: remove inequality   until it hurts the least advantages. Contrast to Pareto efficiency principle,   which doesn't care about individuals, but just overall outcome. (Fair   opportunity)   Ayn Rand - hates altruism from a Nietzsche perspectives. Selfishness is good   because people have value in themselves. So capitalism is the only moral   system of government. Society is only great in so far as it’s individuals are   great. In favor of minimal states: optional taxes for police and military.   (Objectivism)   Robert Nozick - Any distribution scheme is unjust because it requires too much   intervention to maintain. Inevitably people will gain a promotion or lose a   job, disrupting the distribution. Also you don’t owe anyone for your fortune   in life: analogy of musician who plays outside your house and then comes with   a bill the next day - you don’t owe them. The veil of ignorance is contrived.   It works for “life boat” cases and other emergency cases, but not in society   where how you got your money matters. Imagine living your life based on how   others want you to live, and you sell shares in your decisions. This is the   opposite of free society, some degree of slavery. (Libertarianism)    Michael Sandel  - Rawls and Nosick are wrong because some values are unchosen:   community, family, etc. the rest are chosen on top. In some cases, individual   liberty can impact community from which that individual liberty is partly   derived. Therefore some things should not become commodities to be bought and   sold: a mother child relationship, surrogacy, outsourcing child rearing etc is   wrong. (Communitarianism)    Alasdair MacIntyre  - Meaning can only be found in narrative, which is   based on the culture and community you belong to. He rejects modernism and   prefers premodern Aristotle to postmodern Nietzsche.    William Galston  - positive liberalism is important but is one of many   worthy values. He rejects moral monism (foxes &gt; hedgehogs) and thinks these   values are in general conflict. Ultimate values are: life itself,   purposiveness, instrumental rationality.    Michael Waltzer  - distributive justice is important but not why Rawls   thinks. A just distribution of a good depends on the good and cultural   conditions. Food, swimming pools, education are all different so distribution   should vary.  What is bad about income inequality? Tyranny of one type   of good over another: it’s that money can buy everything: security,   healthcare, better cars, sex, political influence, commutation (avoiding the   draft). It’s bad when different “spheres of justice” become too asymmetrical.   Free market rules only apply to the bazaar, but treating everything as commerce   ruins things.     Feminism, Multiculturalism, Environmentalism, Postmodernism (Lectures 29 - 32)     Susan Okin - progressive justice doesn’t take into account women’s special   rights. Women in reality make less, so no fault marriage is equal but unjust.   Wife beating is political in the same way that racially motivated crime is.   The private is political. Women are generally more focused on the private.   (Feminism)    Carol Gilligan  - normal development for humans is masculinized by society.   In fact women are fundamentally different (essentialist). Men think in terms   of rights and rules. Women focus more on care, community.   Iris Marion Young - identity is often construed as negative. Example: Who am   I? I’m not like this cis-gendered white male! Critical of negative identity   because individuals belong to many groups.    Charles Taylor  - all cultures deserve to be recognized but what is their   respective value? Should Shakespeare and Achebe get the same amount of   coverage in school? Cultures are of equal value is nonsensical, muzzles   critical powers.   Bhikhu Parekh - the majority culture should adjust to its immigrants. For   example, wearing a turban is a disadvantage for motorcycling, hence the Sikh   helmet exception law in the UK, which is just to normalize the disadvantage.   Brian Barry - individuals should not be disadvantaged by the groups they are   born into. The Amish must stop preventing their children from going to high   school. (Assimilation)   Will Kymlicka - in liberalism, a group has as much rights as the sum total of   rights of its individuals. But this doesn’t work for small groups like   indigenous tribes. This gets tricky if liberties undermine the culture of the   minority community. (Multiculturalism)   John Muir - preserve nature as it is because it is sacred. (Preservation)   Gifford Pinchot - conserve nature but still allow it to be used for human   purposes. (Managed Conservation)   Peter Singer - argues for animal welfare on a utilitarian basis. Their   suffering should be reduced wherever possible. Applies to mammals and probably   birds and amphibians. Speciesism is the analogue of sexism, racism etc.   (Animal rights)   Tom Regan - non human animals have deontological rights. They have an identity   and so have inherent value and rights. (Kantian animal rights)    Aldo Leopold  - animals eat one another in the wild, but we now have   control over ecosystems. We must "think like a mountain". This is a   communitarian approach often driven by the desire to keep biodiversity high.   (Moral ecology)   Richard Rorty - there is no non circular justification for any philosophical   argument. (Anti-foundationalism)   Jean-François Lyotard -  everything is mediated by culture, which   manifests as a series of signs. Beyond that, it’s all language games. (Radical   structuralism)   Michel Foucault - truth is defined by society and is intended for controlling   the people. Society has constructed its canon out of straight white men. This   is a problem, and blacks, women, and homosexuals need to be brought into the   fray. Biases inherent in western ideals, feminist, multicultural ideas are   all legacies. (Postmodernism)    Jürgen Habermas  - attempts to defend enlightenment and modernism from both   Nietzsche postmodernism and conservative premodernism. Expands notion of   rationality to communication. Kinds of rationality:   Epistemically rationality: what is true.   Instrumental rationality: rational action.   Communicative rationality (Habermas): we can decide together what we should     do. If what parties are saying is expressed dishonestly, it’s strategic     communication.     Democracy is all about communicative rationality. There is a conflict between   “the system” and the “lifeworld”, first of which is money and power driven,   second is democratic communicative action. System infringes on the life world:   less is decided conversationally and more moneyed.   Post cold war (Lectures 33 - 35)     Francis Fukuyama - History is about the slaves seeking and achieving equality   (Hegel, Kojev). We're well on our way now, and nothing will really beat   liberal democracy ever. Problem is that the end-state (universal equality) is   bad because it leads to Nietzches “last man”, an ambitionless passiveness. So   there must be room for individual thriving, or Thumos. (End of History)    Benjamin Barber  - We accidentally flooded the world with mcworld, the 3   Ms: McDonald’s, Macintosh, MTV, but not with the civil society requires for   democracy. “Neither Jihad nor McWorld promises a remotely democratic future”.   Model: Tocqueville. (Jihad vs. McWorld)   Samuel Huntington - Culture matters to how states govern.  Listen 9 modern   civilizations: Eastern Europe, greater China, Islamic belt, India, Japan, etc.   Conflicts will occur at the borders between these civilizations.  Western   culture is not replicable. Elements are exportable, but it won’t be a full   package. Globalism will increase tension and resistance because identity is   often constructed negatively. (The Clash of Civilizations)    Ernest Gelner  - airlifting free elections and market economy into Soviet   block countries isn’t sufficient. What you need is modern civil society, by   which he means a plurality of ideas: neither church, nor market, nor govt can   dominate. Life is modular and each part follows different rules. So pluralism   is key. In the West this loss of identity was OK because of nationalism. Most   countries are no longer Ideocracies (single moral idea, no pluralism) with the   exception of those dominated by political Islam.   Mahatma Gandhi/Martin Luther King - forceful non violent resistance but   inspired by Tolstoy. (Non-violent resistance)   William T. Sherman - open to war as needed. "War is hell". (War Realism)    Michael Waltzer  (this time on war) - War is sometimes justified but is   regimented by rules for going to war and then conduct during war. (Contrast to   Just War Pacifism, which thinks modern technology is too dangerous to ever   use.) Codified in Geneva and Hague conventions.  But tricky for civil wars:   are the rebels criminals (to be punished) or combatants (protected by Geneva)?   Terror against civilians is never ok, and tricky for combatants. Peacekeeping   is justified if the target country is no longer able to guarantee rights to   its people ("the right to have rights"). For example if there’s a genocide the   country is unable to protect its citizens or is complicit in the act and must   be stopped. Less clear who needs to intervene though. Dirty hands: politicians   cannot be deontologists but must consider the utilitarian outcome for their   people. (Just War theory)     This is a great overview of some philosophical underpinning of politics. I learned a ton, gleaming new things about philosophers I was already familiar with because of superior summarization, and learning about completely new philosophers I hadn't even heard of before. Well worth a listen, and a re-listen." />

  <meta property="og:title" content="The Modern Political Tradition: Hobbes to Habermas" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="An impressively comprehensive series of 36 half-hour  lectures on political philosophy . I wanted a political philosophy survey to better understand some of the political articles I've been reading in Foreign Affairs, as well as have a better sense of context for the current moment.   The lecturer, Lawrence Cahoone, is an engaging speaker, and organized the material really well. He goes chronologically through some of modernity's most influential political philosophers, and summarizes their most important ideas. I found that Cahoone was able to summarize the philosophers I was familiar with pretty succinctly, although of course it's very hard to avoid oversimplification. I was also surprised by how many thinkers I hadn't even heard of.   This was not an easy course to follow for a layperson like me. I found myself having to re-listen to some of the more dense lectures multiple times before I felt like I grasped the concepts. Some philosphers remain shrowded in mystery. Most notably, Hegel and Strauss continue to defy summarization. In the latter lectures, he does a great job of tying more modern and controversial ideas surrounding feminism and multiculturalism back to older thinkers.   Here are some of the philosophers he covers, as well as brief summaries for me to index on later. As a note to myself, here are ones that I thought were most interesting, and would be worth delving into in more depth: Carl von Clausewitz, Alexis de Tocqueville, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Leonard Hobhouse, Hannah Arendt, Friedrich von Hayek, Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre, William Galston, Michael Waltzer, Carol Gilligan, Charles Taylor, Aldo Leopold, Jürgen Habermas, Benjamin Barber, Ernest Gelner. What follow are a survey of a survey, brief notes on each philosopher that was mentioned in the course.   Formation of Liberal Republicanism (Lectures 3 - 16)     Plato - we need a philosopher king.   Machiavelli - Realpolitik. Politics is amoral. The enemy of my enemy is my   friend.   Hobbes - the state of nature is a war of all against all. In the social   contract, you give up rights for security. (Social contract)   Locke - people have natural rights to life, liberty and property. The   government isn’t your master, it’s your servant. (Liberty)   Rousseau - the noble savage was better off than the modern man because   everyone was equal. Independence, equality and community are most important.   "Man is born free yet is everywhere in chains". (Equality)   Kant - morals are derived from reason and not experience. And you must always   act according to the categorical imperative. Kant is a non-consequentialist,   outcome doesn’t matter. (Deontology)   Adam Smith - self-interest can be good. The invisible hand guides private self   interest to create public benefit. (Emergence, Markets)   Montesquieu - checks and balances will prevent despotism. Separate powers into   legislative, executive and judicial branches. (Checks and Balances)   Jefferson - inherited wealth and inherited debt is bad for society.   Hamilton - too much federation is bad, leads to internal conflict. Feared   “Petty republics without any shared unifying purposes”. Centralize for   strength: banks, patent office, etc.   Madison - tyranny of the majority is real. States/communities should have   equal power in some sense (eg. electoral college, 2 senators per state)   Richard Price - the French rightfully replaced King’s with laws. In favor of   elections and explicit consent. (Republicanism)   Edmund Burke - England depends on traditional institutions: royalty, the   church.  Political norms don't come from reason but from tradition.   (Conservatism)   Thomas Payne - there is no power above the people other than god. Natural   rights exist, according to reason. Burke is irrational, tradition is bad.   Joseph de Maistre (far right) - nature is inherently evil. Man must submit   soul to god and body to the state. The order is not rational.   (Counter-enlightenment)   William Godwin (far left) - government coercion is bad. Moral individuality and   rationally derived conduct is good. (Anarchy)   Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (far far left) - there is no such thing as absolute   dominion. Property rights over indefinite timescale don’t make sense.   (Anarchy)   Leo Tolstoy - war and church are sources of violent coercion. Violence is   always evil even when monopolized by government. Logical continuation from   turning the other cheek from Christ. (Anarchic pacifism)   Johann Gottlieb Fichte - "For each people, a country, for each country, a   people". This means pan-German unification, mass literacy, etc. A sort of   celebration of diversity on a country level. (Nationalism)   Napoleon - The draft changed warfare forever. No more chivalrous knights,   fealty for the king and hired mercenaries. Just a 600k strong standing army.   (Conscription)    Carl von Clausewitz  - "War is the continuation of politics by other means".   "Real war" is ritualized, chivalrous, traditional. But "ideal war" is pure   conflict, fewer rules, objective is to make your opponents surrender. (War   theory)   Isaiah Berlin - negative liberty (freedom from x, liberty from coercion) vs   positive liberty (freedom to do y, self determination). Positive liberty means   there are multiple “goods”, requiring a pluralistic society.   Hegel - Everything has a thesis, a counter thesis, and then a synthesis   combining both. (Dialectic?)    Alexis de Tocqueville  - Traditional society gave aristocratic individuals   freedom, provided structures of mutual obligation. Modern citizens are   independent free and equal but alone so the government will have to do many   things that family, guilds, feudal structures did before. But in America this   can be mitigated with clubs, churches, other “civil society” outside of   politics. (Civil society)   Jeremy Bentham and James Mill - natural rights is “nonsense on stilts”, the   guiding star is general utility. And this means what people actually value   (from experience, not kantian intuition). Bentham: “push-pin (a children's   game) is as good as poetry” (Utilitarianism)   John Stuart Mill - there is a hierarchy of pleasures. “It is better to be a human   dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a   fool satisfied.” Act to maximize total pleasure overall. Also the harm   principle: be free up to the point of harming others. Harm here   is specifically utilitarian (eg. affecting others concretely, ie. not eating   pork in private). Diversity of opinion is important, marketplace of ideas   brings us closer to the truth. (Liberalism)   Henry J. S. Maine - the individual surpasses the family as the unit to which   law applies. (Individualism)   Eric Weil - loss of community is part of modernity in favor of a looser   association and voluntary groups.    Émile Durkheim  - Modern society is characterized by specialization.   Traditional society was fractal - every hunter gatherer group was the same,   now they vary. (Specialization)   Georg Simmel - Money dehumanizes.    Max Weber  - work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity   is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends.   Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to   a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an   all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)   Friedrich Nietzsche - "God is dead" and modern society is sick. What are the   values that increase the viability of a society? Definitely not equality,   since without ambition it turns mankind into a herd. Need Übermensch to   transcend the Judeo-Christian tradition by finding meaning in chaotic   modernity.   Sigmund Freud - people are still basically primitive and have drives that   contradict modern values. This leads to inevitable regressions like world war   1 and 2.  (Drive theory)     The Crisis of Liberal Republicanism from 1914 to 1953 (Lectures 17 - 20)      Leonard Hobhouse  - Laissez faire capitalism didn’t work and reduced the   world to “Manchesterism” - terrible industrial dystopia. Sought a softer mix   of liberalism and socialism. “Organic liberalism” is consequentialist, and   should improve society. People are inherently social, and any impact they have   must be reflected there. Communitarian, interactionist, prescient.   William J. Brian - empower the poor against the elites. Hallmark of populism   is railing against the economic hegemony and social   conservatism. (Populism)   Roosevelt - large monopolies have too much power. The wealthy few form a   tyranny of the minority. 3 C’s: consumer protection, control of corporations,   conservation of natural resources. A shift to more presidential/executive   power to reform the constitution and modernize it.   Wilson - again shift to more presidential power. Checks and balances are too   constraining. Political society is evolving.   Eduard Bernstein - capitalism will evolve to be more socialist organically,   and markets don’t need to be fully abolished. What’s important is that workers   are treated better. (Soft socialism)   Lenin - communism won’t come on its own. Bernstein is a political prostitute.   Communism needs a revolution and a hard line proletarian government that is   wholly dedicated to ushering the new era. Freedom isn’t possible until then so   all spheres of life, including art, must serve this goal. (Totalitarian   socialism)   György Lukács / Theodor Adorno / Max Horkheimer - capitalism lacks any   reference point from which to criticize it. It commodifies everything too   well. But despite western leanings they were quite sympathetic to Leninism.   “parliamentary democracy is like having a debate club at the edge of the   abyss.” The enlightenment wears away at beliefs, so all that remains is power.

Charles Taylor  - all cultures deserve to be recognized but what is their   respective value? Should Shakespeare and Achebe get the same amount of   coverage in school? Cultures are of equal value is nonsensical, muzzles   critical powers.   Bhikhu Parekh - the majority culture should adjust to its immigrants. For   example, wearing a turban is a disadvantage for motorcycling, hence the Sikh   helmet exception law in the UK, which is just to normalize the disadvantage.   Brian Barry - individuals should not be disadvantaged by the groups they are   born into. The Amish must stop preventing their children from going to high   school. (Assimilation)   Will Kymlicka - in liberalism, a group has as much rights as the sum total of   rights of its individuals. But this doesn’t work for small groups like   indigenous tribes. This gets tricky if liberties undermine the culture of the   minority community. (Multiculturalism)   John Muir - preserve nature as it is because it is sacred. (Preservation)   Gifford Pinchot - conserve nature but still allow it to be used for human   purposes. (Managed Conservation)   Peter Singer - argues for animal welfare on a utilitarian basis. Their   suffering should be reduced wherever possible. Applies to mammals and probably   birds and amphibians. Speciesism is the analogue of sexism, racism etc.   (Animal rights)   Tom Regan - non human animals have deontological rights. They have an identity   and so have inherent value and rights. (Kantian animal rights)    Aldo Leopold  - animals eat one another in the wild, but we now have   control over ecosystems. We must "think like a mountain". This is a   communitarian approach often driven by the desire to keep biodiversity high.   (Moral ecology)   Richard Rorty - there is no non circular justification for any philosophical   argument. (Anti-foundationalism)   Jean-François Lyotard -  everything is mediated by culture, which   manifests as a series of signs. Beyond that, it’s all language games. (Radical   structuralism)   Michel Foucault - truth is defined by society and is intended for controlling   the people. Society has constructed its canon out of straight white men. This   is a problem, and blacks, women, and homosexuals need to be brought into the   fray. Biases inherent in western ideals, feminist, multicultural ideas are   all legacies. (Postmodernism)    Jürgen Habermas  - attempts to defend enlightenment and modernism from both   Nietzsche postmodernism and conservative premodernism. Expands notion of   rationality to communication. Kinds of rationality:   Epistemically rationality: what is true.   Instrumental rationality: rational action.   Communicative rationality (Habermas): we can decide together what we should     do. If what parties are saying is expressed dishonestly, it’s strategic     communication.     Democracy is all about communicative rationality. There is a conflict between   “the system” and the “lifeworld”, first of which is money and power driven,   second is democratic communicative action. System infringes on the life world:   less is decided conversationally and more moneyed.   Post cold war (Lectures 33 - 35)     Francis Fukuyama - History is about the slaves seeking and achieving equality   (Hegel, Kojev). We're well on our way now, and nothing will really beat   liberal democracy ever. Problem is that the end-state (universal equality) is   bad because it leads to Nietzches “last man”, an ambitionless passiveness. So   there must be room for individual thriving, or Thumos. (End of History)    Benjamin Barber  - We accidentally flooded the world with mcworld, the 3   Ms: McDonald’s, Macintosh, MTV, but not with the civil society requires for   democracy. “Neither Jihad nor McWorld promises a remotely democratic future”.   Model: Tocqueville. (Jihad vs. McWorld)   Samuel Huntington - Culture matters to how states govern.  Listen 9 modern   civilizations: Eastern Europe, greater China, Islamic belt, India, Japan, etc.   Conflicts will occur at the borders between these civilizations.  Western   culture is not replicable. Elements are exportable, but it won’t be a full   package. Globalism will increase tension and resistance because identity is   often constructed negatively. (The Clash of Civilizations)    Ernest Gelner  - airlifting free elections and market economy into Soviet   block countries isn’t sufficient. What you need is modern civil society, by   which he means a plurality of ideas: neither church, nor market, nor govt can   dominate. Life is modular and each part follows different rules. So pluralism   is key. In the West this loss of identity was OK because of nationalism. Most   countries are no longer Ideocracies (single moral idea, no pluralism) with the   exception of those dominated by political Islam.   Mahatma Gandhi/Martin Luther King - forceful non violent resistance but   inspired by Tolstoy. (Non-violent resistance)   William T. Sherman - open to war as needed. "War is hell". (War Realism)    Michael Waltzer  (this time on war) - War is sometimes justified but is   regimented by rules for going to war and then conduct during war. (Contrast to   Just War Pacifism, which thinks modern technology is too dangerous to ever   use.) Codified in Geneva and Hague conventions.  But tricky for civil wars:   are the rebels criminals (to be punished) or combatants (protected by Geneva)?   Terror against civilians is never ok, and tricky for combatants. Peacekeeping   is justified if the target country is no longer able to guarantee rights to   its people ("the right to have rights"). For example if there’s a genocide the   country is unable to protect its citizens or is complicit in the act and must   be stopped. Less clear who needs to intervene though. Dirty hands: politicians   cannot be deontologists but must consider the utilitarian outcome for their   people. (Just War theory)     This is a great overview of some philosophical underpinning of politics. I learned a ton, gleaming new things about philosophers I was already familiar with because of superior summarization, and learning about completely new philosophers I hadn't even heard of before. Well worth a listen, and a re-listen." />

    <div class='body'>
      <p>An impressively comprehensive series of 36 half-hour <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/The-Modern-Political-Tradition-Hobbes-to-Habermas-Audiobook/B00K58X53Q">lectures on political
philosophy</a>. I wanted a political philosophy survey to better understand
some of the political articles I've been reading in Foreign Affairs, as well as
have a better sense of context for the current moment.</p>
<p>The lecturer, Lawrence Cahoone, is an engaging speaker, and organized the
material really well. He goes chronologically through some of modernity's most
influential political philosophers, and summarizes their most important ideas.
I found that Cahoone was able to summarize the philosophers I was familiar with
pretty succinctly, although of course it's very hard to avoid
oversimplification. I was also surprised by how many thinkers I hadn't even
heard of.</p>
<p>This was not an easy course to follow for a layperson like me. I found myself
having to re-listen to some of the more dense lectures multiple times before I
felt like I grasped the concepts. Some philosphers remain shrowded in mystery.
Most notably, Hegel and Strauss continue to defy summarization. In the latter
lectures, he does a great job of tying more modern and controversial ideas
surrounding feminism and multiculturalism back to older thinkers.</p>
<p>Here are some of the philosophers he covers, as well as brief summaries for me
to index on later. As a note to myself, here are ones that I thought were most
interesting, and would be worth delving into in more depth: Carl von Clausewitz,
Alexis de Tocqueville, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Leonard Hobhouse, Hannah
Arendt, Friedrich von Hayek, Michael Sandel, Alasdair MacIntyre, William
Galston, Michael Waltzer, Carol Gilligan, Charles Taylor, Aldo Leopold, Jürgen
Habermas, Benjamin Barber, Ernest Gelner. What follow are a survey of a survey,
brief notes on each philosopher that was mentioned in the course.</p>
<h2>Formation of Liberal Republicanism (Lectures 3 - 16)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plato - we need a philosopher king.</li>
<li>Machiavelli - Realpolitik. Politics is amoral. The enemy of my enemy is my
  friend.</li>
<li>Hobbes - the state of nature is a war of all against all. In the social
  contract, you give up rights for security. (Social contract)</li>
<li>Locke - people have natural rights to life, liberty and property. The
  government isn’t your master, it’s your servant. (Liberty)</li>
<li>Rousseau - the noble savage was better off than the modern man because
  everyone was equal. Independence, equality and community are most important.
  "Man is born free yet is everywhere in chains". (Equality)</li>
<li>Kant - morals are derived from reason and not experience. And you must always
  act according to the categorical imperative. Kant is a non-consequentialist,
  outcome doesn’t matter. (Deontology)</li>
<li>Adam Smith - self-interest can be good. The invisible hand guides private self
  interest to create public benefit. (Emergence, Markets)</li>
<li>Montesquieu - checks and balances will prevent despotism. Separate powers into
  legislative, executive and judicial branches. (Checks and Balances)</li>
<li>Jefferson - inherited wealth and inherited debt is bad for society.</li>
<li>Hamilton - too much federation is bad, leads to internal conflict. Feared
  “Petty republics without any shared unifying purposes”. Centralize for
  strength: banks, patent office, etc.</li>
<li>Madison - tyranny of the majority is real. States/communities should have
  equal power in some sense (eg. electoral college, 2 senators per state)</li>
<li>Richard Price - the French rightfully replaced King’s with laws. In favor of
  elections and explicit consent. (Republicanism)</li>
<li>Edmund Burke - England depends on traditional institutions: royalty, the
  church.  Political norms don't come from reason but from tradition.
  (Conservatism)</li>
<li>Thomas Payne - there is no power above the people other than god. Natural
  rights exist, according to reason. Burke is irrational, tradition is bad.</li>
<li>Joseph de Maistre (far right) - nature is inherently evil. Man must submit
  soul to god and body to the state. The order is not rational.
  (Counter-enlightenment)</li>
<li>William Godwin (far left) - government coercion is bad. Moral individuality and
  rationally derived conduct is good. (Anarchy)</li>
<li>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (far far left) - there is no such thing as absolute
  dominion. Property rights over indefinite timescale don’t make sense.
  (Anarchy)</li>
<li>Leo Tolstoy - war and church are sources of violent coercion. Violence is
  always evil even when monopolized by government. Logical continuation from
  turning the other cheek from Christ. (Anarchic pacifism)</li>
<li>Johann Gottlieb Fichte - "For each people, a country, for each country, a
  people". This means pan-German unification, mass literacy, etc. A sort of
  celebration of diversity on a country level. (Nationalism)</li>
<li>Napoleon - The draft changed warfare forever. No more chivalrous knights,
  fealty for the king and hired mercenaries. Just a 600k strong standing army.
  (Conscription)</li>
<li><strong>Carl von Clausewitz</strong> - "War is the continuation of politics by other means".
  "Real war" is ritualized, chivalrous, traditional. But "ideal war" is pure
  conflict, fewer rules, objective is to make your opponents surrender. (War
  theory)</li>
<li>Isaiah Berlin - negative liberty (freedom from x, liberty from coercion) vs
  positive liberty (freedom to do y, self determination). Positive liberty means
  there are multiple “goods”, requiring a pluralistic society.</li>
<li>Hegel - Everything has a thesis, a counter thesis, and then a synthesis
  combining both. (Dialectic?)</li>
<li><strong>Alexis de Tocqueville</strong> - Traditional society gave aristocratic individuals
  freedom, provided structures of mutual obligation. Modern citizens are
  independent free and equal but alone so the government will have to do many
  things that family, guilds, feudal structures did before. But in America this
  can be mitigated with clubs, churches, other “civil society” outside of
  politics. (Civil society)</li>
<li>Jeremy Bentham and James Mill - natural rights is “nonsense on stilts”, the
  guiding star is general utility. And this means what people actually value
  (from experience, not kantian intuition). Bentham: “push-pin (a children's
  game) is as good as poetry” (Utilitarianism)</li>
<li>John Stuart Mill - there is a hierarchy of pleasures. “It is better to be a human
  dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a
  fool satisfied.” Act to maximize total pleasure overall. Also the harm
  principle: be free up to the point of harming others. Harm here
  is specifically utilitarian (eg. affecting others concretely, ie. not eating
  pork in private). Diversity of opinion is important, marketplace of ideas
  brings us closer to the truth. (Liberalism)</li>
<li>Henry J. S. Maine - the individual surpasses the family as the unit to which
  law applies. (Individualism)</li>
<li>Eric Weil - loss of community is part of modernity in favor of a looser
  association and voluntary groups.</li>
<li><strong>Émile Durkheim</strong> - Modern society is characterized by specialization.
  Traditional society was fractal - every hunter gatherer group was the same,
  now they vary. (Specialization)</li>
<li>Georg Simmel - Money dehumanizes.</li>
<li><strong>Max Weber</strong> - work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity
  is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends.
  Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to
  a permanent identity crisis. Weber’s options are: bear with it or return to an
  all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)</li>
<li>Friedrich Nietzsche - "God is dead" and modern society is sick. What are the
  values that increase the viability of a society? Definitely not equality,
  since without ambition it turns mankind into a herd. Need Übermensch to
  transcend the Judeo-Christian tradition by finding meaning in chaotic
  modernity.</li>
<li>Sigmund Freud - people are still basically primitive and have drives that
  contradict modern values. This leads to inevitable regressions like world war
  1 and 2.  (Drive theory)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Crisis of Liberal Republicanism from 1914 to 1953 (Lectures 17 - 20)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leonard Hobhouse</strong> - Laissez faire capitalism didn’t work and reduced the
  world to “Manchesterism” - terrible industrial dystopia. Sought a softer mix
  of liberalism and socialism. “Organic liberalism” is consequentialist, and
  should improve society. People are inherently social, and any impact they have
  must be reflected there. Communitarian, interactionist, prescient.</li>
<li>William J. Brian - empower the poor against the elites. Hallmark of populism
  is railing against the economic hegemony and social
  conservatism. (Populism)</li>
<li>Roosevelt - large monopolies have too much power. The wealthy few form a
  tyranny of the minority. 3 C’s: consumer protection, control of corporations,
  conservation of natural resources. A shift to more presidential/executive
  power to reform the constitution and modernize it.</li>
<li>Wilson - again shift to more presidential power. Checks and balances are too
  constraining. Political society is evolving.</li>
<li>Eduard Bernstein - capitalism will evolve to be more socialist organically,
  and markets don’t need to be fully abolished. What’s important is that workers
  are treated better. (Soft socialism)</li>
<li>Lenin - communism won’t come on its own. Bernstein is a political prostitute.
  Communism needs a revolution and a hard line proletarian government that is
  wholly dedicated to ushering the new era. Freedom isn’t possible until then so
  all spheres of life, including art, must serve this goal. (Totalitarian
  socialism)</li>
<li>György Lukács / Theodor Adorno / Max Horkheimer - capitalism lacks any
  reference point from which to criticize it. It commodifies everything too
  well. But despite western leanings they were quite sympathetic to Leninism.
  “parliamentary democracy is like having a debate club at the edge of the
  abyss.” The enlightenment wears away at beliefs, so all that remains is power.</li>
<li>Georges Sorel - True morality requires martial virtue, readiness for violence,
  and self sacrifice. (Anarcho syndicalism)</li>
<li>Carl Schmitt - Fascism is an enlightened rationalist dictatorship. Politics is
  above economics, morality, etc. Social contract theory is wrong. Even Locke
  wanted there to be an emergency valve where the executive branch takes over.
  But then the executive must also decide if there’s an emergency in the first
  place. Ultimately it comes down to a non-rational decision. It’s a theological
  politics. (Fascism)</li>
<li>Peter Drucker - Fascism is disappointed socialism. Need something less
  international, less economic centric. Especially in light of standing armies
  of WW1, nationalism is key, and there needs to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29Mg6Gfh9Co">bigger
  idea</a>. (Nationalism)</li>
<li><strong>Hannah Arendt</strong> - totalitarianism of Hitler and Stalin is unlike anything
  that came before. Total organization of society is mobilized for the state.
  Nothing remains of civil society. No more art or chess for its own sake. She
  characterized Nazis as banality of evil, just following orders while comma
  unthinkable atrocities. (Totalitarianism) Distinction between labor, work, and
  action:</li>
<li>Labor is recurring and pure maintenance: cooking, dishes, chores,
    ephemeral output.</li>
<li>Work results in durable output: fixing the car, wiring poetry.</li>
<li>Action: deeds and speeches of free and equal individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Arendt, action &gt; work &gt; labor, but modernity focuses too much on economics
  and so devalues work in favor of labor and action in favor of work. Powerful
  argument against both capitalism and marxism framed in art. For capitalists,
  the value of art is financial, for marxists, it's instrumental: for the sake
  of advancing communism. For her, it's intrinsic.
- Giulio Douhet - since so much depends on military technology, produced in
  factories, factories and civilians are legitimate targets.</p>
<h2>Political theory during the Cold War (Lectures 21 - 24)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Michael Oakeshott - political behavior cannot be deduced from rationalism alone.
  Politics can be engineered and must be guided by practical knowledge. Great
  analogy to recipes: you need cooking skills to make a great dish, not just
  rule following.</li>
<li>Ludwig von Mises - a planned economy is actually impossible. It’s too complex.
  Markets have emergent properties and no central planner can know it.
  (Anti-communist)</li>
<li><strong>Friedrich von Hayek</strong> - Government should ensure equal rights but not equal
  outcomes. Avowed anti-rationalist, believes in limitations of rationality, and
  so spontaneous order created by multiple individuals. Markets are both good
  and bad, you must have losers to have winners. The market must remain free,
  but the losers can be propped up by the government. The market isn’t a
  meritocracy, but based around value, or willingness to pay. Hayek is in
  favor of free market regulation, for some domains: safety, sanitation,
  breaking up monopolies, even health care. The worst is when prices, wages, and
  production schedules are fixed by the government because it breaks emergent
  spontaneity.</li>
<li>Milton Friedman - in favor of negative income tax or basic income. Opposed to
  professional licensing run by governments. (Libertarianism)</li>
<li>Leo Strauss - Philosophy is fundamentally always inconclusive. Athens vs
  Jerusalem: religion has all of the answers, but the ancient philosophers could
  deal with the uncertainty of taking philosophy seriously.</li>
<li>Alexandre Kojève - history ended with Napoleon and Hegel. No more
  qualitative changes in human thinking.</li>
<li>Herbert Marcuse - Advanced capitalism is totalitarian, integrating everything
  into itself. Example: music that may have begun as counter culture like jazz,
  hip hop, rock eventually gets played at the Super Bowl. In post capitalism,
  work becomes play. “One dimensional man” was the Bible for the new left and
  SDS of the 60s (New Left)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Domestic political arguments (Lectures 25 - 28)</h2>
<ul>
<li>John Rawls - what distribution of material wealth is just? Socialists usually
  focus on outcomes, neoliberals on history. Rawls is a progressive deontologist.
  Veil of Ignorance forces people to make ideal laws for a society without
  knowing what their position will be. In this case, take the maximin approach:
  best worst case. The only acceptable inequality is due to talent &amp; hard work,
  not birth status. “Fair opportunity“. Difference principle: remove inequality
  until it hurts the least advantages. Contrast to Pareto efficiency principle,
  which doesn't care about individuals, but just overall outcome. (Fair
  opportunity)</li>
<li>Ayn Rand - hates altruism from a Nietzsche perspectives. Selfishness is good
  because people have value in themselves. So capitalism is the only moral
  system of government. Society is only great in so far as it’s individuals are
  great. In favor of minimal states: optional taxes for police and military.
  (Objectivism)</li>
<li>Robert Nozick - Any distribution scheme is unjust because it requires too much
  intervention to maintain. Inevitably people will gain a promotion or lose a
  job, disrupting the distribution. Also you don’t owe anyone for your fortune
  in life: analogy of musician who plays outside your house and then comes with
  a bill the next day - you don’t owe them. The veil of ignorance is contrived.
  It works for “life boat” cases and other emergency cases, but not in society
  where how you got your money matters. Imagine living your life based on how
  others want you to live, and you sell shares in your decisions. This is the
  opposite of free society, some degree of slavery. (Libertarianism)</li>
<li><strong>Michael Sandel</strong> - Rawls and Nosick are wrong because some values are unchosen:
  community, family, etc. the rest are chosen on top. In some cases, individual
  liberty can impact community from which that individual liberty is partly
  derived. Therefore some things should not become commodities to be bought and
  sold: a mother child relationship, surrogacy, outsourcing child rearing etc is
  wrong. (Communitarianism)</li>
<li><strong>Alasdair MacIntyre</strong> - Meaning can only be found in narrative, which is
  based on the culture and community you belong to. He rejects modernism and
  prefers premodern Aristotle to postmodern Nietzsche.</li>
<li><strong>William Galston</strong> - positive liberalism is important but is one of many
  worthy values. He rejects moral monism (foxes &gt; hedgehogs) and thinks these
  values are in general conflict. Ultimate values are: life itself,
  purposiveness, instrumental rationality.</li>
<li><strong>Michael Waltzer</strong> - distributive justice is important but not why Rawls
  thinks. A just distribution of a good depends on the good and cultural
  conditions. Food, swimming pools, education are all different so distribution
  should vary.  What is bad about income inequality? Tyranny of one type
  of good over another: it’s that money can buy everything: security,
  healthcare, better cars, sex, political influence, commutation (avoiding the
  draft). It’s bad when different “spheres of justice” become too asymmetrical.
  Free market rules only apply to the bazaar, but treating everything as commerce
  ruins things.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feminism, Multiculturalism, Environmentalism, Postmodernism (Lectures 29 - 32)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Susan Okin - progressive justice doesn’t take into account women’s special
  rights. Women in reality make less, so no fault marriage is equal but unjust.
  Wife beating is political in the same way that racially motivated crime is.
  The private is political. Women are generally more focused on the private.
  (Feminism)</li>
<li><strong>Carol Gilligan</strong> - normal development for humans is masculinized by society.
  In fact women are fundamentally different (essentialist). Men think in terms
  of rights and rules. Women focus more on care, community.</li>
<li>Iris Marion Young - identity is often construed as negative. Example: Who am
  I? I’m not like this cis-gendered white male! Critical of negative identity
  because individuals belong to many groups.</li>
<li><strong>Charles Taylor</strong> - all cultures deserve to be recognized but what is their
  respective value? Should Shakespeare and Achebe get the same amount of
  coverage in school? Cultures are of equal value is nonsensical, muzzles
  critical powers.</li>
<li>Bhikhu Parekh - the majority culture should adjust to its immigrants. For
  example, wearing a turban is a disadvantage for motorcycling, hence the Sikh
  helmet exception law in the UK, which is just to normalize the disadvantage.</li>
<li>Brian Barry - individuals should not be disadvantaged by the groups they are
  born into. The Amish must stop preventing their children from going to high
  school. (Assimilation)</li>
<li>Will Kymlicka - in liberalism, a group has as much rights as the sum total of
  rights of its individuals. But this doesn’t work for small groups like
  indigenous tribes. This gets tricky if liberties undermine the culture of the
  minority community. (Multiculturalism)</li>
<li>John Muir - preserve nature as it is because it is sacred. (Preservation)</li>
<li>Gifford Pinchot - conserve nature but still allow it to be used for human
  purposes. (Managed Conservation)</li>
<li>Peter Singer - argues for animal welfare on a utilitarian basis. Their
  suffering should be reduced wherever possible. Applies to mammals and probably
  birds and amphibians. Speciesism is the analogue of sexism, racism etc.
  (Animal rights)</li>
<li>Tom Regan - non human animals have deontological rights. They have an identity
  and so have inherent value and rights. (Kantian animal rights)</li>
<li><strong>Aldo Leopold</strong> - animals eat one another in the wild, but we now have
  control over ecosystems. We must "think like a mountain". This is a
  communitarian approach often driven by the desire to keep biodiversity high.
  (Moral ecology)</li>
<li>Richard Rorty - there is no non circular justification for any philosophical
  argument. (Anti-foundationalism)</li>
<li>Jean-François Lyotard -  everything is mediated by culture, which</li>
<li>manifests as a series of signs. Beyond that, it’s all language games. (Radical
  structuralism)</li>
<li>Michel Foucault - truth is defined by society and is intended for controlling
  the people. Society has constructed its canon out of straight white men. This
  is a problem, and blacks, women, and homosexuals need to be brought into the
  fray. Biases inherent in western ideals, feminist, multicultural ideas are
  all legacies. (Postmodernism)</li>
<li><strong>Jürgen Habermas</strong> - attempts to defend enlightenment and modernism from both
  Nietzsche postmodernism and conservative premodernism. Expands notion of
  rationality to communication. Kinds of rationality:</li>
<li>Epistemically rationality: what is true.</li>
<li>Instrumental rationality: rational action.</li>
<li>Communicative rationality (Habermas): we can decide together what we should
    do. If what parties are saying is expressed dishonestly, it’s strategic
    communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Democracy is all about communicative rationality. There is a conflict between
  “the system” and the “lifeworld”, first of which is money and power driven,
  second is democratic communicative action. System infringes on the life world:
  less is decided conversationally and more moneyed.</p>
<h2>Post cold war (Lectures 33 - 35)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Francis Fukuyama - History is about the slaves seeking and achieving equality
  (Hegel, Kojev). We're well on our way now, and nothing will really beat
  liberal democracy ever. Problem is that the end-state (universal equality) is
  bad because it leads to Nietzches “last man”, an ambitionless passiveness. So
  there must be room for individual thriving, or Thumos. (End of History)</li>
<li><strong>Benjamin Barber</strong> - We accidentally flooded the world with mcworld, the 3
  Ms: McDonald’s, Macintosh, MTV, but not with the civil society requires for
  democracy. “Neither Jihad nor McWorld promises a remotely democratic future”.
  Model: Tocqueville. (Jihad vs. McWorld)</li>
<li>Samuel Huntington - Culture matters to how states govern.  Listen 9 modern
  civilizations: Eastern Europe, greater China, Islamic belt, India, Japan, etc.
  Conflicts will occur at the borders between these civilizations.  Western
  culture is not replicable. Elements are exportable, but it won’t be a full
  package. Globalism will increase tension and resistance because identity is
  often constructed negatively. (The Clash of Civilizations)</li>
<li><strong>Ernest Gelner</strong> - airlifting free elections and market economy into Soviet
  block countries isn’t sufficient. What you need is modern civil society, by
  which he means a plurality of ideas: neither church, nor market, nor govt can
  dominate. Life is modular and each part follows different rules. So pluralism
  is key. In the West this loss of identity was OK because of nationalism. Most
  countries are no longer Ideocracies (single moral idea, no pluralism) with the
  exception of those dominated by political Islam.</li>
<li>Mahatma Gandhi/Martin Luther King - forceful non violent resistance but
  inspired by Tolstoy. (Non-violent resistance)</li>
<li>William T. Sherman - open to war as needed. "War is hell". (War Realism)</li>
<li><strong>Michael Waltzer</strong> (this time on war) - War is sometimes justified but is
  regimented by rules for going to war and then conduct during war. (Contrast to
  Just War Pacifism, which thinks modern technology is too dangerous to ever
  use.) Codified in Geneva and Hague conventions.  But tricky for civil wars:
  are the rebels criminals (to be punished) or combatants (protected by Geneva)?
  Terror against civilians is never ok, and tricky for combatants. Peacekeeping
  is justified if the target country is no longer able to guarantee rights to
  its people ("the right to have rights"). For example if there’s a genocide the
  country is unable to protect its citizens or is complicit in the act and must
  be stopped. Less clear who needs to intervene though. Dirty hands: politicians
  cannot be deontologists but must consider the utilitarian outcome for their
  people. (Just War theory)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great overview of some philosophical underpinning of politics. I
learned a ton, gleaming new things about philosophers I was already familiar
with because of superior summarization, and learning about completely new
philosophers I hadn't even heard of before. Well worth a listen, and a
re-listen.</p>
