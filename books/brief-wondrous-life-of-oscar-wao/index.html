  <meta name="description" content="Liked:     Copious references to nerd culture: nerdy books (LOTR, Dune, Lovecraft,   Asimov, Heinlein), video games, comic books, the 1980s.   Magical realism aspects: The Mongoose, cartoonish villans (The Captain,   Trujillo) and heroes (Beli, The Doctor).   Harkening to 100 Years of Solitude in the hispanic family epic.   Nonlinear time, with the story flashing generations back.   Oscar's relatable innocence, goofy character, purity of spirit.   Interesting autobiographical narrator.   Unexpected turns. After a slow start, you are taken into a deep rabbit hole of   an incredibly turbulent family story. Things get weirder and weirder and more   and more depressing. Fuku!   Also, a really interesting look into Dominican Republic, and the political   turmoil it went through in the 20th century.   Fun to try to decipher the Spanish only having a rudimentary knowledge of the   language!   Very distinct and conversational tone.     Disliked:     A little too sappy and charicaturey. Oscar's self-loathing is comical, and   it's hard to really empathize with the guy." />
