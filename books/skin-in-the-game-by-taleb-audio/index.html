  <meta name="description" content="Taleb is back with another book. It has interesting, but poorly organized ideas. Fortunately, it is mercifully short acting more of a summary of his previous work (I only read Antifragile). I don't think I could handle much more virtiol.   First, the interesting parts.   The thesis of "Skin in the Game" is that decision makers need to be subject to the downsides that arise from their bad decisions, not just the upside of their good ones. Skin in the game used to be normal: some kings and emperors would fight on the front lines. Lords traded personal risk for prominence. In modernity, many decision makers, such as bureaucrats that make decisions on whether or not to go to war, are shielded from their actions. He makes some interesting arguments:     Big companies want employees to be family men. Because they have more   dependents and thus debt. So they are less likely to leave.   Cato’s injunction: it's better to have someone ask why you don’t have a statue   rather than why you do.   VR can never be compelling since there's no downside risk to you. You have no   skin in the game. (This might be a leap I'm taking).   The Silver Rule - negative version of the golden rule: don’t do to others what   you wouldn’t want them to do to you. He expands on the definition of "you",   which is interestingly applied in the plural as well, to individuals,   families, tribes, countries. This is the libertarian version of the Golden   Rule.   Static vs. dynamic inequality: an important distinction. Wealth inequality is   not itself bad. It would be fair if people rotated through the wealth classes   over their lifetimes. Taleb claims that they do (which I highly doubt) and   this is his critique of Picketty.   But the fact that the market permits the prince become the pauper is an   example of skin in the game. And actually this status loss is super   relatable to people (eg. Trump).   Taleb is in favor of parsimony, and suspicious of an argument defended by too   many data points. This is his critique of Pinker's "everything is awesome"   narrative.   Lindy effect - for some non-perishable things, the longer something exists the   longer it will continue to exist.   Peer reviews are problematic because your peers aren’t necessarily the right   judges. Instead, time is the only judge. (I agree in theory, but in   practice, time takes too long).   Religion can affect actions and words. To the extent that religions affect   words, Taleb is fine with it. He claims most modern religions affect words   only, and there is no function difference between a Catholic and an Atheist.   Claims that Atheists like Dawkins &amp; Harris don't properly understand the   distinctions between various kinds of belief. In practice, everyone has some   "religious" practices like honoring the dead.   Rationality of a belief makes no sense. The only rationality that makes sense,   is that of an action, any only from the standpoint of survival. That which   helps you survive is rational. From this perspective, whether or not you can   explain something has no bearing on whether it’s rational or not.   Good reminder: correlation between deaths matters. Even though Ebola kills   fewer people than bathtubs, it’s still a bigger risk because it's an   infectuous disease, and so has huge downside.   Loss aversion isn't an irrational bias. It's rational to be fearful of ruin.   Summary statistics are often misleading. “Never cross a river if it is on   average 4ft deep”.     Taleb concludes with thought provoking advice:     Never engage in virtue signaling;   Never engage in rent-seeking;   You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business.     I take issue with the tone in which the book is written. Taleb's level of hatred towards some ideas and people, especially Steven Pinker is quite funny and jarring. Whole chapters, such as the one devoted to Intellectuals Yet Idiots, come off as a giant rant. He makes a lot of ridiculous claims which deserve to be ignored or made fun of:     He insults people as "not even weightlifters". I think this is a reference to   his obsession with deadlifting.   Taleb uses “domestication" as an insult. But the flip side is that this is the   basis of a functional social system.   He claims that employees are just like slaves. But employment is at-will on   both sides, and the trend today is away from "lifer"-dom.   He disparages academics because "talk is cheap", yet writes many books with   pompous names.   He claims that public speakers get nervous because of the stage lights in   their eyes.   Made up words like econophaster, psychosophaster and scientism aren't   winning him any favors.     Taleb is a provocoteur. But why? His ideas are actually quite academic and intellectual, so he's not trying to appeal to populist masses. So who  is  his target audience? Who knows? Anyway, I listened to this book, and it was probably more worthwhile than listening to podcasts, but that's a pretty low bar. I can't really recommend you do the same, so here are some interesting names that Taleb mentions instead:     Herb Simon - bounded rationality: people are fundamentally limited. (I've been   meaning to read him since being a CMU student.)   Gerd Gigerenzer - many things appear illogical but are actually done for good   reasons.   Ken Binmore - the word “rational” is ill defined. It’s all about revealed   preferences." />

      <p>Taleb is back with another book. It has interesting, but poorly organized ideas.
Fortunately, it is mercifully short acting more of a summary of his previous
work (I only read Antifragile). I don't think I could handle much more virtiol.</p>
<p>First, the interesting parts.</p>
<p>The thesis of "Skin in the Game" is that decision makers need to be
subject to the downsides that arise from their bad decisions, not just the
upside of their good ones. Skin in the game used to be normal: some kings and
emperors would fight on the front lines. Lords traded personal risk for
prominence. In modernity, many decision makers, such as bureaucrats that make
decisions on whether or not to go to war, are shielded from their actions. He
makes some interesting arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big companies want employees to be family men. Because they have more
  dependents and thus debt. So they are less likely to leave.</li>
<li>Cato’s injunction: it's better to have someone ask why you don’t have a statue
  rather than why you do.</li>
<li>VR can never be compelling since there's no downside risk to you. You have no
  skin in the game. (This might be a leap I'm taking).</li>
<li>The Silver Rule - negative version of the golden rule: don’t do to others what
  you wouldn’t want them to do to you. He expands on the definition of "you",
  which is interestingly applied in the plural as well, to individuals,
  families, tribes, countries. This is the libertarian version of the Golden
  Rule.</li>
<li>Static vs. dynamic inequality: an important distinction. Wealth inequality is
  not itself bad. It would be fair if people rotated through the wealth classes
  over their lifetimes. Taleb claims that they do (which I highly doubt) and
  this is his critique of Picketty.</li>
<li>But the fact that the market permits the prince become the pauper is an
  example of skin in the game. And actually this status loss is super
  relatable to people (eg. Trump).</li>
<li>Taleb is in favor of parsimony, and suspicious of an argument defended by too
  many data points. This is his critique of Pinker's "everything is awesome"
  narrative.</li>
<li>Lindy effect - for some non-perishable things, the longer something exists the
  longer it will continue to exist.</li>
<li>Peer reviews are problematic because your peers aren’t necessarily the right
  judges. Instead, time is the only judge. (I agree in theory, but in
  practice, time takes too long).</li>
<li>Religion can affect actions and words. To the extent that religions affect
  words, Taleb is fine with it. He claims most modern religions affect words
  only, and there is no function difference between a Catholic and an Atheist.</li>
<li>Claims that Atheists like Dawkins &amp; Harris don't properly understand the
  distinctions between various kinds of belief. In practice, everyone has some
  "religious" practices like honoring the dead.</li>
<li>Rationality of a belief makes no sense. The only rationality that makes sense,
  is that of an action, any only from the standpoint of survival. That which
  helps you survive is rational. From this perspective, whether or not you can
  explain something has no bearing on whether it’s rational or not.</li>
<li>Good reminder: correlation between deaths matters. Even though Ebola kills
  fewer people than bathtubs, it’s still a bigger risk because it's an
  infectuous disease, and so has huge downside.</li>
<li>Loss aversion isn't an irrational bias. It's rational to be fearful of ruin.</li>
<li>Summary statistics are often misleading. “Never cross a river if it is on
  average 4ft deep”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taleb concludes with thought provoking advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never engage in virtue signaling;</li>
<li>Never engage in rent-seeking;</li>
<li>You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business.</li>
</ol>
<p>I take issue with the tone in which the book is written. Taleb's level of hatred
towards some ideas and people, especially Steven Pinker is quite funny and
jarring. Whole chapters, such as the one devoted to Intellectuals Yet Idiots,
come off as a giant rant. He makes a lot of ridiculous claims which deserve to
be ignored or made fun of:</p>
<ul>
<li>He insults people as "not even weightlifters". I think this is a reference to
  his obsession with deadlifting.</li>
<li>Taleb uses “domestication" as an insult. But the flip side is that this is the
  basis of a functional social system.</li>
<li>He claims that employees are just like slaves. But employment is at-will on
  both sides, and the trend today is away from "lifer"-dom.</li>
<li>He disparages academics because "talk is cheap", yet writes many books with
  pompous names.</li>
<li>He claims that public speakers get nervous because of the stage lights in
  their eyes.</li>
<li>Made up words like econophaster, psychosophaster and scientism aren't
  winning him any favors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taleb is a provocoteur. But why? His ideas are actually quite academic and
intellectual, so he's not trying to appeal to populist masses. So who <strong>is</strong>
his target audience? Who knows? Anyway, I listened to this book, and it was
probably more worthwhile than listening to podcasts, but that's a pretty low
bar. I can't really recommend you do the same, so here are some interesting
names that Taleb mentions instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Herb Simon - bounded rationality: people are fundamentally limited. (I've been
  meaning to read him since being a CMU student.)</li>
<li>Gerd Gigerenzer - many things appear illogical but are actually done for good
  reasons.</li>
<li>Ken Binmore - the word “rational” is ill defined. It’s all about revealed
  preferences.</li>
</ul>
