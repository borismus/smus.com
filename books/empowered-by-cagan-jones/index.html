  <meta name="description" content="My skip-skip-skip level manager at work recommended it to all of his manager reports, and so I decided to read this book to get closer to the top brass. Overall it was a sobering read, actively reminding me how far my organization is from being customer-centric. The book mostly addresses product managers, but tries to also apply to leaders in general, and "product people" in particular. It's a bit unclear who these people are, but I suspect they include product-minded engineers and designers.   Things I liked:      Coach-as-manager : Emphasis on coach-as-manager was interesting. "You can no longer be a good manager without being a good coach."    Build Right Thing : The goal of a product manager is to ensure that the features being built by the product engineering team are the right features to be building.    Product Discovery : The product development process is a process of discovery. It's like the product is already there, you just need to discover it, as opposed to inventing it from whole cloth.    PM's fault : for a product to be successful, all cross-functional stakeholders have to have been successful. But if a product is not successful, it's the fault of the product manager.    Platform vs. experience : Platform teams are not the same as experience teams and I strongly gravitate towards experience teams. The worst is when your experience team gets reorged to become a platform team.    Against the agency model : The authors advocate strongly against the agency model, which encourages employees to behave like mercenaries rather than like missionaries.    Strategy means focus :    Four big product risks : ( Four Big Product Risks )   Value: will they buy it?   Usability: will they figure out how to use it?   Feasibility: can we build it?   Business viability: will it work for the business?         Things I did not like:     Perpetuating Silicon Valley tropes:   Bill Campbell cult (reminds me of CB)   Favorite essay is "Software is Eating the World". How trite!       Unclear how lessons from this book apply to completely new products like Smart Glasses. How we be customer-centric in a world where we have no customers?   Authors seem overly optimistic about equity based compensation as a way to perfectly align incentives. At a company the size of Google, I don't think that sufficiently aligns individual actions. Might work better at a smaller company though!" />
