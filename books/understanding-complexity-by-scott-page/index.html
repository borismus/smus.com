      <p>Overall a dense but short listen. Potpourri of new ideas, and far better than
<em>Why Information Grows by Cesar Hidalgo</em>. This lecture is well organized,
engagingly narrated, with memorable examples. A great, rather intense
introduction to Complexity.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas I from the book I found interesting.</p>

<p><em>Wolfram’s four system types</em> -

<p><em>Complexity happens in a sweet spot</em> - There are four necessary conditions for
complexity. But it's necessary that all of these conditions be present in
moderate quantities. Too much or too little of any of them will lead to
equilibrium, not complexity.</p>

<p><em>Measuring diversity generally speaking</em> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index</a></p>

<p><em>Dancing landscape</em> - rugged landscapes that change over time.</p>

<p><em>Creative vs. evolutionary processes</em> - Evolution is relentless and infinitely
persistent, like the tortoise. Creativity requires drive from a specific group
of people, who are finite in energy and time, but can move quickly, like the
