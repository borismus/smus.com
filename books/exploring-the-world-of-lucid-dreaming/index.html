As I delved into questions intimately tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner workings of our mind.    VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences never possible in a sense-rich environment.    I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall.

      <p>I bought this book 10 years ago, and it just sat on my shelf ever since. Not
sure how I got into it in the first place, but my interest in lucid dreaming has
increased as a result of my work on VR. As I delved into questions intimately
tied to human perception, I've become more and more interested in the inner
workings of our mind.</p>

<p>VR is sensory replacement, AR is sensory augmentation, but dreaming is sensory
deprivation. Yet the latter can generate completely fascinating experiences
never possible in a sense-rich environment.</p>

<p>I read the first half of the book, and realized that the thing I'm actually
interested in is not necessarily crafting the perfect dream, solving problems in
my dreams, etc. But a more introspective pursuit, focused on trying to
understand my own dreams. Which dovetails nicely given that the first step of
lucid dreaming is reliable dream recall. So, while I'm unlikely to become an
oneironaut, at the very least I've started a handwritten dream journal, which I
keep on my bedside table.</p>
