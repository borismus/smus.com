  <meta name="description" content="Well done overview of American History with a historiographical twist. Reminded me of Mr. Begin's history classes, but probably a little more sophisticated. I really liked the lecturer's call to skepticism, which rang throughout, as he questioned theme after theme of cliché Americanisms. I really liked his spiral model of historical progress, and also the fact that he dropped enough references that I now have plenty of follow-up work to do. A worthwhile course for any non-American. Buy it on  TTC ." />

      <p>Well done overview of American History with a historiographical twist. Reminded
me of Mr. Begin's history classes, but probably a little more sophisticated. I
really liked the lecturer's call to skepticism, which rang throughout, as he
questioned theme after theme of cliché Americanisms. I really liked his spiral
model of historical progress, and also the fact that he dropped enough
references that I now have plenty of follow-up work to do. A worthwhile course
for any non-American. Buy it on <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-skeptic-s-guide-to-american-history.html">TTC</a>.</p>
