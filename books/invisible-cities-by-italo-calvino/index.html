  <meta name="description" content="Calvino writes in some of the most poetic prose in my recent memory. At times it borders on obscurity, but often it is beautiful almost beyond words.    Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan stories of the cities he's been to. A handful of cities are each vividly described in a few paragraphs, and then we return to the court, where Polo, diplomatic like a dragoman, tends to Khan's whims.     Are all of these cities metaphors for facets of a single city? Are the cities real? Has Polo even been to them? Are Khan and Polo really communicating non-verbally, in gestures and dances? Everything has an ethereal feel, and all of the aforementioned questions are raised by the author himself, and all turn out to be irrelevant.     At the same time, Calvino captures truths and conveys ideas with the emotional valence that only good fiction writers can. All the while, the descriptions of his cities are masterfully written, and incredibly imaginative. Some of my highlights follow.    A familiar feeling when traveling:        Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant   that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in   time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he   had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the   place of that man in that square.      Another familiar feeling:        “Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to   resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless   dust cloud invades the continents.      So imaginative:        You do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night,   by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out   on piles of carpets, at each word that one man says—such as “wolf,” “sister,”   “hidden treasure,” “battle,” “scabies,” “lovers”—the others tell, each one, his   tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that   in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camel’s swaying   or the junk’s rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your   wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle   other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at   every solstice and at every equinox.      And vivid:        Thus the city repeats its life, identical, shifting up and down on its empty   chessboard. The inhabitants repeat the same scenes, with the acton changed; they   repeat the same speeches with variously combined accents; they open alternate   mouths in identical yawns. Alone, among all the cities of the empire, Eutropia   remains always the same. Mercury, god of the fickle, to whom the city is sacred,   worked this ambiguous miracle.      High modernist failure mode (after a generation, residents of the planned city Perinthia gradually turn into by monsters):        Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must   admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to   describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is   reflected exactly in the city of monsters." />

      <p>Calvino writes in some of the most poetic prose in my recent memory. At times it
borders on obscurity, but often it is beautiful almost beyond words.</p>

<p>Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan stories of the cities he's been to. A handful of
cities are each vividly described in a few paragraphs, and then we return to the
court, where Polo, diplomatic like a dragoman, tends to Khan's whims. </p>

<p>Are all of these cities metaphors for facets of a single city? Are the cities
real? Has Polo even been to them? Are Khan and Polo really communicating
non-verbally, in gestures and dances? Everything has an ethereal feel, and all
of the aforementioned questions are raised by the author himself, and all turn
out to be irrelevant. </p>

<p>At the same time, Calvino captures truths and conveys ideas with the emotional
valence that only good fiction writers can. All the while, the descriptions of
his cities are masterfully written, and incredibly imaginative. Some of my
highlights follow.</p>

<p>A familiar feeling when traveling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant
  that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in
  time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he
  had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the
  place of that man in that square.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another familiar feeling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to
  resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless
  dust cloud invades the continents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So imaginative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night,
  by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out
  on piles of carpets, at each word that one man says—such as “wolf,” “sister,”
  “hidden treasure,” “battle,” “scabies,” “lovers”—the others tell, each one, his
  tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that
  in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camel’s swaying
  or the junk’s rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your
  wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle
  other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at
  every solstice and at every equinox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And vivid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus the city repeats its life, identical, shifting up and down on its empty
  chessboard. The inhabitants repeat the same scenes, with the acton changed; they
  repeat the same speeches with variously combined accents; they open alternate
  mouths in identical yawns. Alone, among all the cities of the empire, Eutropia
  remains always the same. Mercury, god of the fickle, to whom the city is sacred,
  worked this ambiguous miracle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>High modernist failure mode (after a generation, residents of the planned city
Perinthia gradually turn into by monsters):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must
  admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to
  describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is
  reflected exactly in the city of monsters.</p>
