      <p>It's pretty funny but in a very high falutin’ way, which detracts from the
comedy.</p>

<p>Isn’t that conjecture just Laplace’s Demon? From WP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Laplace's demon is a hypothetical all-knowing being who knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, and therefore could use Newton's laws to reveal the entire course of cosmic events, past and future. Based upon the philosophical proposition of causal determinism.</p>

<p>Septimus &amp; Chater demanding satisfaction exchange is hilarious!</p>

<p>Overall I’m struggling to follow the arc. Lots of wit but just very much a
comedy of errors. I might try again when I'm in a more frivolous headspace.</p>

<p>A stray thought: I haven't tended to really enjoy plays much. Is this a lack of
imagination on my part? Perhaps it takes more work to truly imagine each
character delivering their lines without any of the scaffolding a narrator
provides...</p>
