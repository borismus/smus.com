  <meta name="description" content="Real science fiction, in a bad way, focusing more on the science than the fiction, Asimov style. Not that great of a book, underdeveloped characters, contrived plot. Really felt like it was written by a technologist, unlike say Bashert by my former CS professor. The main reason I read it was for is focus on VR, but even for that I got bored about half way through and had to force myself to finish.    The library allegory felt too obvious, as if the author was just shoving the out with the old, in with the new in your face." />
