The lecturer wasn't very engaging, and I found myself listening to a lot of the lectures without getting much out of them. Additionally, the volume was low and the recording was poor quality, which contributed to my meta objections." />

      <p>Nice insight and guiding theme: international politics is complicated because
there isn't really an organization that stands above all nations. Unlike other
human endeavors, if a rogue entity misbehaves, there isn't really anyone to go
to by default. Each country has its own skin to worry about, and they need to
figure out the best strategy.</p>
<p>I liked the concept of the balance of power, presented in 3 versions by the
lecturer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply the distribution of existing power.</li>
<li>The state in which all parties in question have equal power</li>
<li>A tendency for new power entering a conflict to join the weak side in order
   to avoid a monopoly of power.</li>
</ol>
<p>After one or two theoretical lectures, the course ventured into territory of
WW1, the interwar years, and WW2. I found this part to be somewhat less engaging
since most of the historical details were review for me, and little of the
theory introduced at the beginning was brought into the fold. The last lecture
was more interesting, since it tried to apply the theory introduced at the
beginning to predict the future. What made it even more interesting is the fact
that the lecture was recorded in the early 90s.</p>
