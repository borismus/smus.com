  <meta name="description" content="An endearing manual for tidying up. I'm naturally inclined to minimalism as it stands and did a massive cleanup of my old room in my parents house just last month so consider myself proficient. But Marie takes it to the next level, revealing an autistic inclination towards the personification of inanimate objects.    This manifesto can easily be reduced to an illustrated one pager, but Marie insists on treading over the same ground multiple times.      Discard everything you don't need by determining if it sparks joy. Go by category, starting with clothes, moving on to books and personal items.   Once you've donated garbage bags full of items, organize them so that everything you own has a place. Stand everything including clothes vertically.      By the end if the book I was curious more about Marie's eccentricity than her organizational method." />
