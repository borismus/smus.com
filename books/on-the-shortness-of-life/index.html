  <meta name="description" content="Seneca lies at the intersection of Roman history, stoic philosophy and Buddhism. Despite many endorsements, I haven’t had the time to sit down and read any of his writings. So I picked up this short volume of three letters, two to his friends and one to his mother.     There are almost no clarifying notes in the book, no context about Seneca's life, events he references, or any of the many names he mentions in supporting his points with exemplars. The Wikipedia page provided some of that, but I missed having annotations in the book.    Overall the letters are very quotable and read easily, with the exception of a few convoluted sentences. I was surprised by how modern ancient Rome sounds, with a surprising plurality of cultures &amp; peoples. Seneca himself was born in Córdoba and moved to Rome.        What are Greek cities doing in the midst of barbarian territories? Why do we   hear the Macedonian language among Indians and Persians? Scythia and all that   wide region of fierce and untamed tribes reveal Achaean cities established on   the shores of the Pontus. [...] Tyrians live in Africa, Phoenicians in Spain;   Greeks penetrated into Gaul and Gauls into Greece; the Pyrenees did not block   the passage of the Germans...      Much of the letters are dedicated to the fallacy of material attachment:        Petty is the mind which delights in earthly things: it should be led away to   those things which appear everywhere equally[...] Fate has cast you into a   land where the most luxurious shelter is a hut.      Because of the inevitability of loss, Seneca suggests to celebrate that which is always with you, the human mind:        Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be   neither given nor taken away. The world you see, nature's greatest and most   glorious creation, and the human guide, which gazes and wonders at it, and is   the most splendid part of it, these are our own everlasting possessions and   will remain with us as long as we ourselves remain.      Despite great advice, Seneca is often accused of profound hypocrisy because he himself was a very wealthy man and as a teacher of Emperor Nero, who was famous for his tyrannical reign. Seneca can also come off very curmudgeonly as he disparages those that don’t live according to his standards:        They seek to stock their pretentious kitchens by hunting beyond the Phasis,   and they aren't ashamed to ask for birds from the Parthians, from whom we have   not yet exacted vengeance. From all sides they collect everything familiar to   a fastidious glutton. From the furthest sea is brought food which their   stomachs, weakened by a voluptuous diet, can scarcely receive. They vomit in   order to eat, and eat in order to vomit.      Overall a worthy, very quotable read, a peek into the world of Seneca's Rome, while contemporary sounding in some ways, also quaint and antiquated, for example in their celestial worldview:        The sun glides constantly, moving on from place to place, and although it   revolves with the universe its motion is nevertheless opposite to that of the   firmament itself: it races through all the signs of the zodiac and never   stops; [...] All the planets forever move round and pass by: as the   constraining law of nature has ordained they are borne from point to point.      I’ll have to revisit more of his writings, perhaps Letter to Lucretius next?" />

      <p>Seneca lies at the intersection of Roman history, stoic philosophy and Buddhism.
Despite many endorsements, I haven’t had the time to sit down and read any of
his writings. So I picked up this short volume of three letters, two to his
friends and one to his mother. </p>

<p>There are almost no clarifying notes in the book, no context about Seneca's
life, events he references, or any of the many names he mentions in supporting
his points with exemplars. The Wikipedia page provided some of that, but I
missed having annotations in the book.</p>

<p>Overall the letters are very quotable and read easily, with the exception of a
few convoluted sentences. I was surprised by how modern ancient Rome sounds,
with a surprising plurality of cultures &amp; peoples. Seneca himself was born in
Córdoba and moved to Rome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are Greek cities doing in the midst of barbarian territories? Why do we
  hear the Macedonian language among Indians and Persians? Scythia and all that
  wide region of fierce and untamed tribes reveal Achaean cities established on
  the shores of the Pontus. [...] Tyrians live in Africa, Phoenicians in Spain;
  Greeks penetrated into Gaul and Gauls into Greece; the Pyrenees did not block
  the passage of the Germans...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of the letters are dedicated to the fallacy of material attachment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Petty is the mind which delights in earthly things: it should be led away to
  those things which appear everywhere equally[...] Fate has cast you into a
  land where the most luxurious shelter is a hut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the inevitability of loss, Seneca suggests to celebrate that which is
always with you, the human mind:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be
  neither given nor taken away. The world you see, nature's greatest and most
  glorious creation, and the human guide, which gazes and wonders at it, and is
  the most splendid part of it, these are our own everlasting possessions and
  will remain with us as long as we ourselves remain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite great advice, Seneca is often accused of profound hypocrisy because he
himself was a very wealthy man and as a teacher of Emperor Nero, who was famous
for his tyrannical reign. Seneca can also come off very curmudgeonly as he
disparages those that don’t live according to his standards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They seek to stock their pretentious kitchens by hunting beyond the Phasis,
  and they aren't ashamed to ask for birds from the Parthians, from whom we have
  not yet exacted vengeance. From all sides they collect everything familiar to
  a fastidious glutton. From the furthest sea is brought food which their
  stomachs, weakened by a voluptuous diet, can scarcely receive. They vomit in
  order to eat, and eat in order to vomit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall a worthy, very quotable read, a peek into the world of Seneca's Rome,
while contemporary sounding in some ways, also quaint and antiquated, for
example in their celestial worldview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun glides constantly, moving on from place to place, and although it
  revolves with the universe its motion is nevertheless opposite to that of the
  firmament itself: it races through all the signs of the zodiac and never
  stops; [...] All the planets forever move round and pass by: as the
  constraining law of nature has ordained they are borne from point to point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll have to revisit more of his writings, perhaps Letter to Lucretius next?</p>
