      <p>This little book was recommended to me by a ski instructor after a ski lesson at
Squaw.  The man was probably in his 70s, but skied incredibly well, and had a
lot of wisdom to pass on. He was tough, but nice, like a One Minute Manager.</p>

<p>More of a pamphlet than a book, One Minute Manager unfolds as a story about a
young man wanting to learn to be a good people manager. The story makes the
points more vivid, but at its core, there is an interesting and somewhat
surprising strategy outlined for being a good hands off manager. The approach
reminds me a little bit of Christian's management style. There are three parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set goals and expectations with the employee, write them down succinctly and
have them ready for review. (This is similar to Google OKRs, and definitely
worthwhile).</li>
<li>Especially early on, look for behaviors that are praise-worthy, and give due
praise honestly and directly. (This seems like a great idea to try on
interns).</li>
<li>Reprimand unwanted behavior as it happens, but emphasize their worth as
people. (This seems quite hard to pull off without being a dick).</li>
