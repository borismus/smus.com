foxes tend to be more swayed by scenario planning. Because they start vividly

<p>Prediction is fundamentally hard because of chaos.</p>

<p>Good predictors:
- Peter Schiff predicting housing crash and recession.
- Ross Anderson predicting y2k mildness.
- Alan Barnes, pioneering work around predictions for Canada.
- James Fallows, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/01/how-america-can-rise-again/307839/">essay</a></p>

<p>Bad predictors:
- David Brooks predicting nonsense.
- Paul Erlich predicting ridiculousness in End of Affluence and Population Bomb
- F. E. Smith, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7711931-the-world-in-2030-a-d">The World in 2030</a>
- Arthur Clark: profiles of the future 1962</p>

<p>Idea: correlation between difficulty of times and likelihood to turn to
superstition and religion. I should keep that in mind in the future. <a href="http://smus.com/hot-bread-delicious-deadly/">Russian
superstition</a> and magical thinking
is not caused by leading a happy life. I should be kinder to those afflicted.</p>

<p>Interesting conclusion: accurate predictions aren't necessary for good choices.
The goal is to make choices that are good in any event. If needed, skew
according to probability.</p>

<p>How to predict better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be fox like: aggregate different sources.</li>
<li>Meta cognition: consider how you arrive at your decisions. Know the biases.
But to avoid falling into them is hard! Exercise: enumerate reasons why
you might be wrong.</li>
<li>Be humble. Predictions are always uncertain. Predictions too far into the
future even more so.</li>
</ul>
