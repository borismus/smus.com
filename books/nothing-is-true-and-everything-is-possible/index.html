  <meta name="description" content="I was catching up on  Leningrad  while reading this book (thanks Vitya), and found the combination of the two to be very powerful. The  song about Prada bags  is great, as are many others, but didn't see easily accessible English subtitles. I don’t have much to add, but here are some excerpts that I found to be extremely powerful:    Vivid description of the influx of huge cash in Russia:        The cash has come so fast, like glitter shaken in a snow globe, that it feels   totally unreal, not something to hoard and save, but to twirl and dance in   like feathers in a pillow fight and cut like paper-mache into different,   quickly changing masks. At 5:00am, the music goes faster and faster, and in   the throbbing, snowing night the cattle [telki] become the Forbeses and the   Forbeses cattle, moving so fast now they can only see the traces of themselves   caught in the strobe across the dance floor.      And the accompanying faux chique of the nouveau riche:        On the ground floor is a spa done up in a faux Roman style with Doric plaster   columns and ruins, frequented by languid, leggy girls here to deepen already   deep tans and have endless manicures and pedicures. The manicures are   elaborate: rainbow-colored, multilayered, glitter-dusted designs of little   hearts and flowers, so much brighter than the girls’ bored eyes, as if they   pour all their utopias into the tiny spaces of their nails.      Mom and Galia’s Forum experience was probably the Landmark Forum, which is a close relative of the Lifespring movement, which Pomerantsev highlights in his book, as a potential cause of depression and suicide for several models featured in the book. These organizations terrify me.    The topic of Russia fascinates me not just because of multiple generations of my ancestors living there, but also as a view into human nature, perhaps at its most extreme.        This has always been the paradox of the new Russian nationalism: on one hand   wanting to conquer all regions around, on the other wanting an ethnically pure   great power. And all that comes out of this confusion is an ever-growing   anger.      Well described profoundly split personality of Russian people: it’s not that some are dissidents and others are believers, it’s that a single person can embody both, at different times. This is a super fascinating of people In general.        The great drama of Russia is not the "transition" between communism and   capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that   during the final decades of the USSR, no one believed in communism and yet   carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of   simulations. For this remains the common, everyday psychology: the Ostankino   producers who make news worshiping the President in the day and then switch on   an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists   who morph from role to role with liquid ease- a nationalist autocrat one   moment and a liberal aesthete the next [Surkov], the "orthodox" oligarchs who   sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism— and keep their money and   families in London. All cultures have differences between “private" and   "public" selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be extreme.      Also terrifyingly effective is his depiction of bureaucrats:        They conjure motions to “ban untraditional sex” or “ban English words”— and to   sanction Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Glance through the careers of these new   religious patriots, and you find they were recently committed democrats and   liberals, pro-Western, preaching modernization, innovation, and commitment to   Russia’s European course, before which they were all good Communists. And   though on the one hand their latest incarnations are just new acts in the   Moscow political cabaret, something about their delivery is different from the   common Russian political performer who gives his rants with a knowing wink and   a nod. Flat and hollow-eyed, as if they have been turned and twisted in so   many ways they’ve spun right off the whirligig into something clinical.   Because isn’t some sort of madness implicit in the system?       Peter ends with a warning, uttered by a British investor in Russia, which resonates strongly with me:        We used to have this self-centered idea that western democracies were the end   of evolution, and we’re dealing from a position of strength, and people are   becoming like us. It’s not this way. The whole of western civilization, "this   is fragile".      Super well written, incredibly engaging throughout. Incredibly so for non-fiction about a depressing topic. Much more entertaining than Gessen’s barrage of pessimism." />

      <p>I was catching up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_(band)">Leningrad</a> while reading this book (thanks Vitya),
and found the combination of the two to be very powerful. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz0pUMN7i7w">song about Prada
bags</a> is great, as are many others, but didn't see easily accessible
English subtitles. I don’t have much to add, but here are some excerpts that I
found to be extremely powerful:</p>

<p>Vivid description of the influx of huge cash in Russia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cash has come so fast, like glitter shaken in a snow globe, that it feels
  totally unreal, not something to hoard and save, but to twirl and dance in
  like feathers in a pillow fight and cut like paper-mache into different,
  quickly changing masks. At 5:00am, the music goes faster and faster, and in
  the throbbing, snowing night the cattle [telki] become the Forbeses and the
  Forbeses cattle, moving so fast now they can only see the traces of themselves
  caught in the strobe across the dance floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the accompanying faux chique of the nouveau riche:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the ground floor is a spa done up in a faux Roman style with Doric plaster
  columns and ruins, frequented by languid, leggy girls here to deepen already
  deep tans and have endless manicures and pedicures. The manicures are
  elaborate: rainbow-colored, multilayered, glitter-dusted designs of little
  hearts and flowers, so much brighter than the girls’ bored eyes, as if they
  pour all their utopias into the tiny spaces of their nails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mom and Galia’s Forum experience was probably the Landmark Forum, which is a
close relative of the Lifespring movement, which Pomerantsev highlights in his
book, as a potential cause of depression and suicide for several models featured
in the book. These organizations terrify me.</p>

<p>The topic of Russia fascinates me not just because of multiple generations of my
ancestors living there, but also as a view into human nature, perhaps at its
most extreme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This has always been the paradox of the new Russian nationalism: on one hand
  wanting to conquer all regions around, on the other wanting an ethnically pure
  great power. And all that comes out of this confusion is an ever-growing
  anger.</p>
