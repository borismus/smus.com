      <p>Rationality used to pervade English scene. Now no appeal to reason is even
attempted.</p>

<p>Mostly arguments today are adversarial. In the past it was possible to have
people with differing opinions not to resort to personal attacks. Appeal to
reason hasn't always been the MO. It comes and goes and the author claims that
were in an especially reason free era.</p>

<p><em>How crazy PR is</em>: Nice case study looking into the political journalistic and
other heavy machinery that is used to sway people. Particularly at the first
Iraq war (about Kuwait), and swaying public opinion to the side of the US.
Especially fascinating is the "Naira" girl who cried wolf, who claimed to be a
Kuwaiti refugee suffering in Iraqi camps, but was actually a member of the
Kuwaiti royal family. Especially interesting is the chain of money and influence
and PR firms that takes that sort of inflammatory material and inject it into
peoples' minds.  Remember "Free Kuwait" t-shirts? Courtesy of Hill and Nolton, a
PR firm which was fed this information.</p>
