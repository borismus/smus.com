  <meta name="description" content="A stylistically beautiful novella reminiscent of  Invisible cities by Italo Calvino . Written in an innovative format, this is more poetry than prose. "Time War" was certainly worth my time, but I could see how it may be annoying to some. At least it is mercifully short!   Observations     Well executed slow reveal (Burn Before Reading)   Multiverse composed of multiple forking strands and threads. They have names and numbers.

It calls to those who care more for living than for their lives”   "She climbs up thread and down. She braids and unbraids history’s hair"       Ridiculously creative way of corresponding with one another. Letters are cleverly encoded in owl pellets (ha gross), seed sacks etc.   Maybe this is deliberate, but who The Seeker is remains unclear. Is it the other agent? Or is it something else, planted by capital-C Chaos?   If the world is a game, Blue and Red play a meta-game. But it feels like there is also a meta-meta game being played, which Blue and Red are only faintly aware of.     Complaints     Blue and Red are agents for two opposing "shifts", led by Garden and Commandant respectively, and representing broadly speaking Nature versus Technology.   Maybe this is somehow the point, but the two narrators/voices of the letters were indistinguishable.       At some point the agents discover that they are madly in love with one another. But the letters are more clever than revelatory, and neither character arc well-defined.   Why did the agents actually fall in love? Pretty unclear.

When I saw it was a time for a change<br>
Killed Tsar and his ministers<br>
Anastasia screamed in vain<br></p>
