      <p>Like many other runners, I like to listen to my music while training.
Even with a playlist of running music, I often want to change the
currently playing track. There are currently two popular options of
doing this: using the device itself, or using a headphone remote. My
ubiquitous computing project from last Spring explores a third option:
imagine if your shoes had built-in accelerometers that allowed you to
skip mid-stride to change tracks. </p>

<p>The most obvious way to change tracks is directly through the music
player, but operating a touch screen while running is pretty annoying. A
much better way of changing tracks is by using a button attached to a
pair of headphones, but finding it, and then double clicking it is often
a frustrating experience. Some clicks don't get registered, so one often
ends up triple-clicking, which skips <em>back</em> a track. My project explores
a novel way of changing tracks: mid-stride skip. This gesture is
detected by having an accelerometer in each shoe which tracks your
running patterns and detects when you perform the skip gesture. In
addition to being useful, this running gesture makes an otherwise
monotonous activity more varied and enjoyable.</p>

<p>I prototyped the skip-to-skip system with a wii remote attached to the
runner's lower leg, as pictured above. A computer is paired to the
wiimote, collecting accelerometer data (especially in the axis
corresponding to the runner's vertical movement). This communication is
established using a wii library from a <a href="/prototyping-wii-remote-python/">previous post</a>. The naive
algorithm I use for detecting skips works as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find peaks by looking at the 1st derivative (positive slope,
negative slope pairs)</li>
<li>Discard insignificant peak values (under a threshold)</li>
<li>Compute distances between peaks</li>
<li>Look at the last 5 distances, and compute the mode. That's the pace.</li>
<li>Look for declinations from the pace characteristic of a skip.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once my gesture recognition code worked reasonably well, I ran a user
study to see how people liked this method compared to the touch screen
and headphone remote. After a few hitches (including getting kicked out
of the Madeira Tecnopolo), I managed to test the prototype with many of
my Madeiran classmates (thanks guys!). Most people preferred the
skip-to-skip method over both the direct smartphone and headphone remote
methods, which is promising.</p>

Copenhagen. If you're interested in the source code, it's located on
