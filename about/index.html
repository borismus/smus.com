<p>Hello from the west coast!</p>
<p>My goal is to invent, design, and build delightful human interfaces at the edge
of technological possibility. I prefer working on small, interdisciplinary
teams, iterating quickly, releasing often, and working in the open. I gravitate
to the web platform, but am also well versed in mobile development,
audio-related technology, and lightweight hardware prototyping. My ideal role
involves a mix of software engineering, UX design, and invention.</p>
<p>I have experience building speech interfaces, virtual reality, audio processing,
the web platform, developer tools, rapid prototyping, interactive visualization,
and user interface design. For the still curious, please see:</p>

<p>I have a Masters in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University,
and a BSc (hon) in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of
British Columbia. I was born in Leningrad, RSFSR, and spent my formative years
