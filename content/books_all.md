Why study the middle ages, and history in general? Daileader provides a pragmatic answer:

- Some things seem like artifacts of modernity, but are a millennium old.
- Others appear fundamental and static, but are in fact very recent and ephemeral.

Unless we can get the story straight, we'll have the wrong intuitions about the world today.

# Sandwich age

Petrarch (13th century) believed that classical Greco-Roman art and culture was the apogee of humanity. After the fall of Rome, which he dated to the sack of Rome in 410, everything went downhill. Naturalism went out the window in favor of abstraction. The Latin language became corrupted. It was all horseshit! Petrarch hoped that his lifetime would see a return to classical values. His hope came true with the emerging Renaissance. Thus, two great eras in human history (classical & renaissance) sandwiched a middle age so terrible it doesn't even deserve a proper name.

During the romantic period, the Middle Ages were viewed with nostalgia. Dirty, polluted, overworked people sought philosophers like Rousseau, who pined for the lush greenery of the past. Marx's vision of constant conflict between classes was seen in contrast to the harmonious system of [[The Three Orders]] of the Middle Age.

Medeival is just how you say Middle Age in Latin. Love it when simple things click into place. 

# Population explosion

Europe's population roughly doubled during the high middle ages (1000-1300), in contrast to [[Early Middle Ages]] (300-1000), where late Rome was charaterized by depopulation, followed by stagnation 700-1000. The era that followed, the [[Late Middle Ages]] were pummeled by the black death leading again to a decline in population. [[Depopulation is often correlated with decline]]

Around 1000 CE, Europe was very rural. Cities had at most 10,000 people living in them. By 1300 many towns grow into cities and have 100,000 residents. 

Why this growth?
1. Decline in foreign attacks (Arabs, Vikings, Magyar marauders), partly because all of the good stuff had already been looted.
2. Roman slave populations were so poorly treated, their populations were declining. As more slaves became serfs, they were treated better and could have higher birth rates.
3. Advances in agricultural technology
2. Climate change: 800 - 1200 is called the [Medeival Warm Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period) a period of improved climate, improving crop yields.

As European cities grew, they became worthwhile stops for global merchants, since their markets now became big enough to be interesting. Italy dominated in trade because of its central position in the mediterranean. It's no accident that the famous Marco Polo emerges from Italy in 1270.

The monetary system also evolves around this time. At the height of Rome, a tri-metallic system was in place. Large transactions were done in gold coins, while bronze and copper coins were used for small daily transactions. By 1000, the continent regressed to a a much simpler system, relying on just silver for all transactions. By 1252, gold coinage was reintroduced by Florence: the florin. Small transactions were done in low quality silver. Related: [[History of global mediums of exchange]].

# Aside on agricultural technology

(Interesting: all three of these are energy efficiency-related...)

## Scratch plows => Moldboard plows

As the Roman empire grew, the Scratch plow began to spread to northern Europe. This plow was designed with a short sharpened wooden stake, making shallow scratchy furrows well suited to dry Mediterranean soil. In contrast, Northern European soils were waterlogged and dense in clay, and the scratch plow hardly made a dent in such soil. [Seed ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield#Seed_ratio) in the early Middle Ages were abysmal, something like 2:1. 

With the introduction of the Moldboard Plow (aka Heavy Plow) from eastern Europe, seed ratios improved drastically. This plow was far heavier, required wheels to move, and a much deeper, metal cutting blade. 

## Ox yokes => Horse collars

Romans used oxen to till the soil. These dumb animals were easily domesticated but slow. To pull a plow, a wooden device called a yoke would sit on top of the ox and the beast would plod across the length of a field. Plots tilled by oxen were long and narrow since ox teams were so hard to turn. [[Second order effects and unintended consequences]]

Horses were much faster, but equally strong as oxen. However their anatomy was quite different from an ox, and the strap of the ox yoke would sit across the horse's neck, pressing on its windpipe. This not only reduced air supply reducing efficiency, but was also often fatal.

The padded horse collar was constructed with leather, and slipped over the horse's shoulders and did not cross its neck at all, allowing it to breathe freely. In addition to not causing broken windpipe related death, it increased horsepower by 5x.

## Water mills

Romans knew about water mills, but did not build them very often. Slaves were so readily available in Rome that they could be relied on to power hand mills, a laborious and incredibly boring process of manually turning a crank. But as agricultural slavery was replaced by serfdom, European rivers become the new laborers.

## ...Crop rotation

Not mentioned in the lecture, but the [Three Field System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-field_system) of crop rotation seems to have emerged around the same time, and made big improvements to crop yields. The core insight there was that  Cereal crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. So one plot would be used for cereals, another for legumes, and the third to replenish itself, rotating every year.

# Those who fought

In early Middle Ages knights were thugs. But they became increasingly legitimate in their power. As merchants became increasingly affluent and more of them wanted to join the ranks of the knights, there was a problem of [[Elite overproduction]].  The fighting class (see [[The Three Orders]]) became so numerous that money alone stopped being enough to join. Now to be dubbed a knight you needed to prove that your bloodline was noble.

After the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the 9th century, noble infighting soared to dangerous highs. The church attempted to curtail this trend by designating days and periods in the calendar as peaceful through programs such as the Peace and Truce of God. [Courtesy Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_book) were uninteresting lists written in Latin and ultimately fell on deaf ears, or into the hands of largely illiterate ruling class. These attempts did little to curtail noble violence.

## Chivalric Romances

Chaplains were clergy members in the courts of noblemen. They were the most worldly of the clergy class and could thus find ways to appeal to the fighting class. The approach that worked turned out to be the new literary genre of Chivalric Romances, around 13th century. These were stories that depicted heroic knights on great adventures of love and conquest. The chivalric code insisted on romantic love with a woman in order to “civilize” a knight and encourage good deeds. 

Chrétien de Troyes wrote simple stories exploring the balance between fighting and loving. In some, the hero focused too much on loving his wife and lost status in the field, causing his wife to leave him. In others, he focused too much on conquest at the expense of his relationship. Damned if you do, and damned if you don’t. Lancelot is a more complex classic, who had an extramarital affair with Arthur’s wife Gwyn.

## Tournaments

Early tournaments around the 11th century evolved from free-for-all mounted melees taking place on large swaths of territory. They were not aimed explicitly at killing but at capture, but the structure was so loose that all bets were off. Action occurred with real weapons, and had real impacts on innocent bystanders, as well as other externalities. Crops were trampled, houses burned, peasants murdered. Not to mention the large death toll among the fighters. 

King and clergy attempted to ban tournaments outright, but failed Instead, they evolved and became more formalized, converging to the 1-on-1 jousting matches with dulled lances and a barrier wall to prevent head on collisions. Knights that broke with chivalric norms, speaking ill of women or hurting the helpless, were disinvited from such gatherings. 

## Feudalism

A special relationship between members of the fighting class began to emerge: lord and vassal. A rising knight could swear an oath of fealty to a lord and become his vassal. This relationship involved rights and responsibilities:

- The lord gave his vassal a fief, usually a plot of land that the vassal would manage and collect income from. The lord would defend the vassal from harm.
- The vassal would come to the lord's aid, usually in a military campaign. The vassal would also give advice to the lord, if the lord requested it.

Gradually, fiefs became hereditary. Eventually vassals began swearing fealty to multiple lords. The concept of liege lord was introduced to indicate the main lord that you are sworn to, but vassals would just swear fealty to multiple liege lords. People are awesome!

# Those who worked

The status of ordinary folk generally improved during the period of 1000-1300. Agricultural slavery faded out and was replaced by serfdom. Most peasants of the time were serfs working for a lord, sometimes a noble, and sometimes a bishopric or monastery. As serfs, they owed their lord seigneurial obligations, meaning they had to till the land for free some number of days a week.

Serfdom gradually became less onerous and less common. Serfs that spent a year in a city would automatically become free, and many would escape in this manner. Lords would treat their serfs better to avoid losing their unpaid workforce entirely. More of the population moved into towns.

Townspeople were split into populo grosso (fat people), consisting of merchants and landlords and populo minuto (little people), consisting of artisans and farmers. 

During periods of heightened violence, towns formed communes, associations of mutual defense which attempted to maintain peace, militia style. These associations were led by elected Consuls, elected for a set term, often a year. Consuls judged when members of the commune were injured, and decided when to exact vengeance.

A town would have one commune, but each trade was governed by its own guild: the bakers, the dyers, etc. To practice a trade you needed to belong to the guild. Guilds enforced the quality of work produced by its members and standardized production and distribution of goods to ensure that nobody had an unfair advantage.

# Those who prayed 

Secular clergy: priests headed by a bishop at a bishopric.
Regular clergy: monks headed by an abbot at a monastery.

Most monasteries were based on a Benedictine laws which were focused on austerity. In practice, many of these laws were bent and broken, especially by orphans and retirees, and others that found themselves in monasteries for reasons outside their own control. Monks could not own property of any sort, at least in theory. But in practice this was often not the case. Monasteries themselves were often rich, beneficiaries of large donations from non-monks as alms, with donors hoping to offset their misdeeds.

## Attempts at reform

At various points monastic reforms were attempted to bring monasteries closer to their platonic ideal. Two ecclesiastical reform movements stand out, often for the cruelty gave their abbots: [Cluniacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluniac_Reforms) and [Cistercians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians). But these reverted to the mean within a couple of centuries. 

Franciscans took a different route, insisting on a new kind of monk that does not belong to a monastery at all. Instead he must own nothing and beg for alms, mimicking the life of the apostles. They were led by St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226), who had pretty intense views. St. Francis did not permit his followers to store up money or provisions for a rainy day, since this indicated a lack of faith. Eventually the Franciscans were recognized by the papacy and their hard-line stances diluted.

The Gregorian movement attempted to reform the secular clergy. It enforced priestly celibacy, which had become uncommon. Simony, the practice of buying bishopric or abbotal appointments, was banned again. It was already illegal, but often eluded in practice. These reforms largely failed, sowing seeds for popular discontent with the church.

## Freethinkers and heretics

As lay people became more literate, they began reading the Bible themselves and coming to their own conclusions. Literacy was highest in urban areas, where merchant class needed to be numerate and literate to do their work. (TODO: what was the actual spread of writing like over time and space? Has this been mapped in detail?)

This combination led to high rates of heresy, self described Christians that challenged the basic tenets of the faith. 

[Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) had a different take on Christianity. Cathars believed that the good God was the God of the New Testament, creator of the spiritual realm, whereas the evil God was the God of the Old Testament, creator of the physical world whom many Cathars identified as Satan. This was against the teachings of the church and they were labeled heretics. Waldenzians, followers of Peter Waldo shared a similar fate.

## Inquisition

During the episcopal inquisition, bishops were asked to double down on the task of ensuring purity of belief of those in their bishopric, weeding out heretics. But many bishops resided in Rome or Paris and not in their bishopric. And bishops were generally very important and busy individuals.

When this failed, professional inquisitors were hired instead. Many of these were taken from the Franciscan and Dominican orders, already used to traveling and begging for alms. These inquisitors would go from village to village and ask the local priest to gather the residents together. The inquisitors were then trained to try to extract as much information as possible. Those that volunteered dirt on their fellow villagers early on would be rewarded with lighter sentences.

Torture by this point was common in Medieval justice. Inquisitors were allowed to use it too, but could not cause bloodshed, mutilation or death. When a subject was found guilty of heresy, they might be forced to wear a yellow cross on their clothing for the rest of their life. Or they would be handed over to the secular authorities to be burned alive.


# Jews of the High Middle ages

As mentioned ad nauseam in [[The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler]], Jews were often expelled from kingdoms. I even made a list of [[History of Jewish Expulsions]].

Why? It was an easy way for kings to make quick money. They would seize Jewish assets and take ownership of all outstanding loans. But this would disrupt the economy, so these measures were often reverted quickly. 

Jews were also forced to wear a badge (star, circle, etc) or a conical cap. Visual indicators were also forced on other minorities, like heretics ([yellow cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathar_yellow_cross)), prostitutes (yellow dress?), and lepers (rattle, clapper). Jews liked the privacy of living in their own enclaves, but the badges were universally hated. It made Jews visible targets of pogroms. The distinguishing badges could sometimes be removed by paying the sovereign a fee. The king would then annul this deal and force Jews to pay again, another money making scheme.

Especially dangerous times for Jews:

- Crusades would often trigger local pogroms, as echoes of holy war would resonate at home.
- Easter sometimes saw accusations of blood libel, where Jews were accused of crucifying a Christian child gone missing from a village. No coincidence too with Christ’s death. Blood libel was only a popular belief, never an official position. 

During the high Middle Ages 1000-1300 prosperity increased but so did anti Jewish violence. 

# Intellectual progress

Monk style education involved rote memorization and recitation. There was no space for intellectual activity because it would open up the possibility of heresy. 

## Scholastic philosophers

Scholastic movement: beginning a tradition of comparison of multiple sources with the goal of synthesizing two seemingly incompatible perspectives into something coherent. Through valiant hoop jumping they seemed to be able to get to an interesting equilibrium. 

[Abelard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard) was an early famous Scholastic with a colorful but gruesome story. He began a tradition of debate, with explicit reliance on old texts - bible and derived works (eg. St. Augustine), but also blended it with the pagan philosophers like Aristotle and Plato.

Classic philosophers were accessible thanks to Islamic preservation efforts, especially the work of Ibn Rushd of Al-Andulus (Averroes). (Why was he not mentioned in [[Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr]]? Seems like that book devoted no time at all to Al-Andulus, just the caliphate centered at Baghdad.)

Scholastic practices were criticized and censored by the church. Their reliance on reason was seen as having excess hubris. Who are they to think that they can contribute something worthy of the great ancient thinkers? Also their reliance on Aristotle and Islamic commentaries and insufficiently on the Bible was seen as problematic. Indeed Aristotle directly contradicted church dogma on some issues. According to Aristotle,

1. The world is eternal, never created
2. There are no souls, only a collective soul
3. There is one God greater than the other Gods, but he is not omnipotent or omniscient

The church attempted to censor Aristotle but ultimately failed. Some Scholastic philosophers were accused of “[double truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_truth)” or of arriving at two different conclusions on an issue depending on whether they considered from a Christian or an Aristotelian perspective.

The most prominent scholastic scholar, St. Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican friar was canonized shortly after his death, illustrating the church's capitulation. Aquinas blended rationalism into Christianity. His magnum opus "Summa Theologica" contained five proofs for the existence of God.

According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.


## Early Universities

Strange sub-plot with early universities. The first two universities in Europe were in Paris and in Bologna. 

Students of universities were called [Clerici vagantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerici_vagantes) or vagabundi, Latin for wandering clergy. They were considered to be part of the secular clergy, and subject to special privileges as a result. No one was allowed to physically harm them; they could only be tried for crimes in an ecclesiastical court, and were thus immune from any corporal punishment. Students took advantage of this and broke secular laws with impunity, engaging in theft, rape, and murder. 

One side effect of students as clergy was that under Canon Law, women could only be part of the regular clergy (nuns), but not part of the secular clergy, so were banned outright from universities.

# The First Crusade

Pilgrimages had been a common practice in Christendom, and increasingly Jerusalem was seen as as destination for penitential pilgrimage. Holy war also had precedents: clergy had previously sponsored battles in which death was linked to salvation.

Crusaders were both pilgrims and holy warriors. This was a brilliant innovation which made the proposition extremely attractive to many people. Pilgrimage was dangerous, but here you were armed to the teeth and could fend for yourself. If you died en route, you would die as a holy warrior. However if you arrived at your destination, you would have fulfilled the pilgrimage. To sweeten the deal, crusaders were given plenary indulgences, remission of all penalties that resulted from sin. Win-win-win!

Crusades were declared by popes, and often for political reasons. The first crusade came shortly after the schism in the papacy. In this schism 1054, numerous disagreements between the Byzantines and the pope came to a head. Two sides failed to come to an agreement and severed ties. Shortly thereafter, the Byzantines were crushed by an Arab invasion. The sitting western pope wanted to try to reunite the church and offered military aid to the east in the form of the first crusade.

## Popular crusade

The first part of the first crusade was led by common people. Many of these crusaders took a detour to first kill a bunch of Jews and loot their stuff in order to finance the trip to Jerusalem. This was done partly from sheer anti-semitism and holy war fervor, but partly from Millenarian convictions that the world would soon end, and that the ends to their salvation justified the means. 

When this first wave of crusaders arrived to rendezvous with Byzantine forces, they arrived earlier than expected, were ill-equipped and hungry. This led to skirmishes among the Christians of the east and the west. Eventually those Popular Crusaders that survived were slaughtered by the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor.

## Baron's crusade

A colorful story, this time about the adventures of crusading knights of noble rank. About 7000 departed from various European kingdoms organized in loose bands under a variety of local leaders. When they arrived at Constantinople to rendezvous with the Byzantines they were not greeted kindly by the Byzantine king Alexios I. Having just been ravished by the people’s crusade he did not trust the westerners and insisted they sign a treaty to ensure territories recently owned by Byzantines would be returned to them. 

First taking [Nicaea in 1097](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Nicaea), then [Antioch in 1098](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Antioch), joint Crusader-Byzantine forces marched toward Jerusalem. However these victories only further eroded relations between east and west. The crusaders took Antioch, and left no prisoners, and their leader Bohemond decided to keep the city for himself, breaching the oath he swore to Alexios. Multiple waves of Muslim reinforcements attempted to take back the city, besieging the crusaders. The crusading knights nearly perished from famine. 

A lowly priest named Peter Bartholomew had a vision wherein St. Andrew came to him and told him that the [Holy Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance) was in Antioch. Enthralled by this, the crusaders began to dig in the cathedral in search for the Holy Lance. Initially coming up empty, Peter joined in the digging and found the object he was looking for, which boosted morale significantly. After fasting for 5 days, the already famished knights sortied out of the garrison with Raymond of Toulouse at the head, carrying the Holy Lance. Despite his general's suggestions, the Turkish commander decided to let all of the knights exit the city walls before engaging them in battle. Soon the Muslim troops were in panicked retreat.

After several months of rest at Antioch, a decimated crusading army set out for the ultimate goal Jerusalem in 1099. Another priest, Peter Desiderius had a vision: if the crusaders circumscribed the Jerusalem walls barefoot, the city would fall within nine days. Befuddled defenders spared these erratic barefoot knights. Sure enough, Jerusalem fell in seven days. This is shocking given an invading force of 1500 against city walls. Unmentioned in the lecture was the fact that an additional 10,000 infantrymen came as reinforcements via Jaffa. Using wood from the boats, Genoese engineers built two huge siege towers (called Malvoisin or "Bad Neighbors"), catapults and a battering ram. Eyewitnesses reported gruesome crusading with the entire population of the city indiscriminately murdered. 

This first crusade marked a turning point in European standing on the world stage, previously clearly inferior to their more technological and culturally developed Muslim neighbors. 

# Norman conquest — meanwhile in England 

The next few lectures were a review of [[The Story of Medieval England]], but the enlarged scope of this lecture made for some new insights.

The Normans were partly Franks but also partly descendants of north men, Vikings that were invited to settle in western France by the Franks in an attempt to prevent other Vikings from raiding and pillaging. 

Vikings seem to have settled often despite their reputation. They were a key genetic component to the Russian (see [[The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler]]), French, and English people.

- Exchequer an early accountant system in England. The name comes from the checkered board in which counters representing debts were moved around.
- Domesday book: is this something where age rounding has been analyzed? Might be a cool baseline. Sadly, doesn't appear to include ages, according to the data in https://opendomesday.org/.
- How can I find digitized versions of early censuses? [[Age Heaping and Numeracy]]

After the Norman conquest, there was an interesting dynamic between England and France. The French speaking Normans that conquered England were vassals to the French king. As a result, William the conqueror and his descendants like Henry II were both feudal subordinates and equals to the French kings. Things got especially weird when the English monarchs controlled large tracts of France (called the [Angevin Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_Empire)) through strategic marriages. 

# Meanwhile in France

By 987 France was being raided by Magyars, Vikings, and Arabs. The kings were no longer able to retain power. Aristocrats rebelled and split the Carolingian kingdom into smaller units. The subsequent dynasty that takes over is led by Hugh Capet, first of the Capetians. Under their watch France further fragmented into duchies and beyond. But the dynasty's lineage continued despite the fragmentation. This continuity helped prevent civil wars which usual meant bad news for the ruling family. 

Learning from the mistakes of the Merovingians and Carolingians, the Capetians changed their succession style. The practiced anticipatory succession and picked an heir before your death. Rather than splitting the kingdom between all of the king's sons, the firstborn was given the kingdom, and his brothers received Appenages (see [[Primogeniture vs partible inheritance]]).

Eventually Louis VI the Fat began to try and assemble the disintegrated French kingdom. He retakes Île-de-France in relentless military attacks against the castellans that resided there. This became the base for expansion, a place to reimpose authority on rebel lords. 

The Capetians waited patiently for opportunities to retake their holdings. They would buy out barons that went bankrupt. They would annex the duchy of a dead duke with no clear heirs.

Phillip II Augustus was the best known king in the Capetian dynasty, an unlikely ruler. Compared to his contemporary Richard Lionheart, he was not much of a warrior, shunning crusading. Instead, he focused on trying to recover French lands that were now in English hands due to the Angevin Empire. At first, he tried to turn King John against his brother Richard but his scheme failed. Finally he decided to exploit the feudal relationship with English kings. He summoned John to nominally resolve a dispute between John and one of his French vassals. When John failed to show up, Philip declared his vassal John Lackland's possessions in the European continent forfeit. 

Philip begins repossessing English lands on the continent. First he took Normandy, then Anjou. John forms an alliance with German king Otto of Brunswick. In 1214, a joint English-German invasion of France begins to try to retake back the Angevin lands. Philip II defeats Otto at the [Battle of Bouvines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bouvines). Upon seeing the Germans crushed, John retreats fearing a similar fate. This confirms Philip's reconquest, leaving just a small region in the French southwest under English control. 

Around the same time, the pope declared a crusade against the south of France known as the [Cathar Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade). Supposedly those in the south were harboring Cathar heretics and thus needed to be cleansed, one of the major cities harboring them was Carcassonne. This was a twenty year affair, extremely bloody. Overall this led the decentralized French political system (discussed in early Middle Ages), further damaged by English conquest, to centralize again under a powerful king. See [[Decentralization and Centralization cycles]]


# England's Canterbury Debacles

A bit more review of [[The Story of Medieval England]], but Thomas Beckett's story is truly fascinating. Appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury by Henry II, Thomas Beckett, personal friend of the king quickly turns on him. Rather than buttressing royal power as expected by Henry, Beckett strongly criticized the corrupt system of royal ecclesiastical appointments. His subversion exiles him to Paris for 6 years, but upon returning, Beckett continues as before. Apocryphally, Henry II asks “will no one rid me of this pesky priest?”, whereupon four of his knights travel to Canterbury and kill Beckett in cold blood in his own cathedral. Beckett is quickly canonized and Henry II pays the price both in PR and by being embarrassingly lashed by monks.

Henry II's son John is also tied up by a [long quarrel at Canterbury in 1205](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_election_of_1205): after the prior archbishop dies, the monks elected a new one, egged on by a doctrine of Papal Supremacy. This is legal but not how the English king liked it — it was normally an appointment in practice. John refuses the election and instead pressured the monks to select his preferred candidate. They agreed to this but the two archbishop candidates both insisted on their legitimacy. As a result the papacy intervenes and insists that both candidates are invalid and that a third archbishop be selected. John refuses this and the pope declares an interdict, a sort of clerical strike in which only key services like baptisms are done. This lasts 6 years and John finally gives in when Innocent III begins to support John's deposition. Ultimately the pope's candidate Stephen Langton becomes Archbishop of Canterbury. Throughout this long period, King John does nothing to retake English possessions retaken by Phillip II, giving him time to prepare.

English barons in France were in a weird position: are they now loyal to France, or to England? They pressured John Lackland to retake the lands. Finally after the botched English-German attack on France, the English barons rebel. They take London and force John to accept the Magma Carta. 

# Magna Carta

A lot of the Magma Carta contains detailed articles that were designed to limit the king's power. Article 39 had more longstanding relevance to us, imposed formal legal restraints on royal will, declaring that no action detrimental to a free man’s life, limb or property was to be taken without a prior judgment in a lawfully constituted court. Within a year John rejects the Magna Carta and then promptly dies. His son Henry III accepts it and has a long reign, paving the path toward a fledgling parliament.

Henry III used the parliament to seek financial aid. The Barons agreed but pushed back, insisting on the [Provisions of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisions_of_Oxford), which gave a group of barons representation in the king's government. The king would gather and consult Great Councils on occasion. These would sometimes include commoners as well as barons. Initially mostly to collect money, these gradually became more formalized in time, soon were done thrice a year. 

Despite all this turmoil, 13th century England had a strong and stable monarchy, at least compared to France and Germany. This led barons to really push back on the monarchy and lobby for more power. This led to rudimentary checks and balances and eventually English Common Law. In weaker states, there was less need for these balances since the king was already weak. Thus when countries like France centralized again, their monarchs became extremely powerful, their power unchecked.

# Meanwhile in Germany

Holy Roman emperors in the territory of Germany had done well for themselves while France was fallen apart into smaller pieces. These Teutonic rulers held a firm grasp on the church through the practice of investiture, in which kings appointed important abbots and bishops. 

## Investiture controversy

Popes had extra leverage over Holy Roman Emperors since the pope was the only individual allowed to crown an emperor, a tradition that went back to Constantine. As part of Gregorian reforms, pope Gregory VII decided to take action against investiture. He terminated a group of imperially appointed bishops in Italy (part of the Holy Roman Empire). In response, Emperor Henry IV wrote a letter denouncing the pope and calling for his resignation. To which Gregory responded, I’m not fired — you’re fired. He excommunicated and deposed Henry IV. German elites then took advantage of the mess, and decided to rebel against their ruler. As a result, Henry IV rushed back to Rome to apologize to the pope. 

The apology led to a temporary truce, but it was clear to the pope that it was not a sincere apology. Also, the German aristocracy was not done rebelling. They declare an alternative candidate, Rudolph as German King. Three years later, Gregory VII declared his support for Rudolph and excommunicated Henry IV. In response, Henry IV declares a new pope and lays siege to Rome with the intent of forcibly replacing the current pope with his candidate known as [Antipope Clement III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_Clement_III). Pope Gregory VII comes close to death as Henry IV takes Rome in 1084, but is saved by an army of Normans that the pope calls on for help. They arrive and force Henry to retreat, but in their zeal [plunder Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1084)).

Eventually several imperial generations later, a truce is reached under the Concordat of Worms (pronounced Verms). This compromise ends the practice of investiture but allows an imperial representative to weigh in on clerical elections. The German kingdom loses power and standing. Enterprising aristocrats use this opportunity to build castles and otherwise entrench their own power base, similar to what happened in France centuries earlier.

The Ottonian dynasty doesn’t fare as well as the Capetians. Overall Henry IV reign shows the weakness of Germany in the 13th century.

- too dependent on their aristocracy, who were keen to take advantage of any weakness.
- too dependent on the papacy, leading to crusades being launched against the Holy Roman Empire.

## Collapse of the Holy Roman Empire

Frederic II was a famous member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The end of his reign marks the point of complete disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's contemporaries called him stupor mundi, the "astonishment of the world".

Born in Sicily, Frederic II was fluent in Arabic. He was well read and even wrote books about hawking. Early in his reign he went on crusade, took a vow to participate or risked excommunication, by then a common issue between kings of Germany and popes. He fell ill (or may have pretended to do so) on his voyage to Jerusalem. The pope promptly excommunicated him and prevented him from continuing the crusade until excommunication was lifted. However, to lift excommunication, pope Gregory IX requested a small gift: Sicily.

Frederic II ignored all of the above and continued on to Jerusalem. Taking advantage of Muslim infighting of the time, he secured Jerusalem for Christendom through diplomacy alone. However the pope was resentful, calling Frederic preambulus Antichristi and denied this treaty. Instead, a papal army marched on Sicily. Frederic was not greeted warmly in Jerusalem by fellow Christians because of an interdict. Frederic II returned quickly to Sicily to quash the papal forces. 

A tentative peace breaks out for a decade. Pope Gregory IX, then his successor Innocent IV called for [a crusade against Frederic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Crusade). Crusaders with vows to the east are allowed to change course to fight Frederic II instead. Some of his own subjects turn against him. Civil wars rage beyond Frederic II's death in 1250, and Germany disintegrates further. The papacy denies election of further members of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The result is a final decimation of the Holy Roman Empire into a loose confederacy with an elected emperor. 



Thirteenth Tribe

cover: /assets/book-covers/thirteenth-tribe.jpg

When I came across The Thirteenth Tribe, I knew that the stars had aligned. I just finished [[Early Middle Ages]] and really enjoyed [[Darkness at Noon by Arthur Koestler]] by Arthur Koestler. 

The first half of the book focuses on the facts. Who were the Khazars? Who were the Rus? Where did these people come from? How did they interact with dominant Byzantines, Ummayads, Abassids? It's super readable and more engaging than prior lectures on the subject matter. That said, I feel that having listened to [[Early Middle Ages]] was a bit of a prerequisite. It would have been too hard to keep track of the major players otherwise.

In contrast, the remainder of the book is way more speculative. Koestler seems to have started with a thesis: Ashkenazi Jews are Khazars. A narrative then is carefully constructed gather the relevant evidence. However given that this is all set in Dark Ages, the facts are inherently sparse and shrouded in uncertainty. 

# Conversion and neutrality

The Khazars converted to Judaism because choosing Christianity or Islam would put them under the authority of either Baghdad or Constantinople. Their decision to convert may have been mostly a pragmatic one on these grounds. Reminds me of that quote attributed to Napoleon:

> "It is by making myself Catholic that I brought peace to Brittany and Vendée. It is by making myself Italian that I won minds in Italy. It is by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt. If I governed a nation of Jews, I should reestablish the Temple of Solomon."

The Khazars adopted Hebrew script too. Some Hebrew letters, ש and צ made it into Cyrillic as ш and ц, after St. Cyril learned their language in Crimea.

Becoming a neutral territory meant that those fleeing forced conversion in Christendom and Islam world had a natural safe haven. Many Greek pagans and their rich classical traditions found their way to Khazaria. So did many Jews of the diaspora. 

The conversion is chronicled by a Khazar king Joseph, in [an exchange of letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Correspondence) with Hasdai ibn Shaprut, a Jewish doctor living in Al-Andalus (modern Spain). In his response, Joseph recounts the Khazar conversion story. After dropping idolatry, King Bulan, sometime in the 8th century needed to choose between the three dominant religions. He gathered a panel of representatives and asked each separately which of the other two religions were least wrong. Judaism won by elimination, since both Christian and Muslim had greater affinity to it than to one another.

The Khazars seem to have been karaiites, meaning that they rejected the rabbinical teachings completely, and only followed the Torah. Meanwhile the rest of the diaspora, concentrated largely in Baghdad and large cities in Al-Andalus like Cordoba, practiced rabbinical Judaism, with a Gaon at the head.


# How Khazaria worked

The Khazars were a Turcik people ruled by a system of dual kingship. The Khagan was the nominal ruler and figurehead. Menawhile the general executive and military general was called the Khagan Bek. Upon end of reign the Khagan was ritually killed.

Khazaria was a buffer state situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, shielding the Byzantine Empire from both Vikings and Arabs. 

Perhaps there's a map in the printed version of this book, but I listened to it and found myself floundering a bit on the geography front. Embarassingly I found it hard to keep all of the rivers (Volga, Dniepr, Don, Ural) straight. I spent a bit of time and put [all the things on a map](https://borismus.github.io/central-asia-maps/), including two major cities, Atil the capital, and Sarkel, the remains of which were flooded by the Soviets in the 1950s.


# Varangians and Khazar decline

The Varangians were Vikings. In the 9th century, they set out on large expeditions with the goal of raiding, trading, and sometimes a combination of both - "forced trade", as Koestler politely puts it. A typical raiding party would be composed of 500 longships of 100 people each. Vikings didn't usually establish permanent settlements outside of their traditional territories, but the Varangians were an exception.

When this group of vikings moved into the territory of modern Ukraine and Russia, they settled down near Kiev and became known as the Rus. They intermingled with native Slavs. Olga is Helga, Oleg is Helgi. Ivan, Ingvarr. Vladimir, Valdamarr. Mind, Blown.

Early Kievan Rus was a shit show. After Igor son of Rurik was killed by a tribe of Slavs called the Drevlians, his wife Olga exacted sweet revenge on them. Igor and Olga had a son, Sviatoslav, who was also a military hero and legendary warrior. Their children caused a civil war for succession. As Koestler would have us think, most of these early Rus regends tended to lead debaucherous lives and then convert to Christianity on their death bed. Some to be subsequently canonized. 

Vladimir, son of Sviatoslav decided it was time to pick a religion. He did so in a Khazar-like fashion. Summoning delegation of representatives. The result is described by the chronicler Nestor:

- Of the **Muslim** Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them, only sorrow and a great stench. He also reported that Islam was undesirable due to its taboo against alcoholic beverages and pork. Vladimir remarked on the occasion: "Drinking is the joy of all Rus'. We cannot exist without that pleasure."
- Ukrainian and Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with **Jewish** envoys and questioning them about their religion, but ultimately rejecting it as well, saying that their loss of Jerusalem was evidence that they had been abandoned by God.

# Rus ⚔️ Khazars

Khazaria and the Byzantines had a long standing alliance. But with price Vladimir’s conversion to orthodoxy, a union Of the Rus and Byzantine was cemented, paving the road for a joint campaign against Khazaria which was already weakened by then.

Additionally, the Khazars levied a 10% tax on traders going through their lands. This ticked off Viking Rus who were capable of trading and raiding.

Sviatoslav destroyed Sarquel and Atil. He had a reputation for having Berserkers in his ranks, from norse legend.

> "The Rus' attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch."

# After the Khazar empire collapsed

Chronologically, first the Khazar empire fell, then new Jewish settlements began to spring up in Poland. Clearly there was some flow between one and the other, but experts disagree how much of the population came from Khazars and how much from Jews ethnically tracing back to ancient Israelites. Koestler suggests that most Jews in Poland came from the Khazar empire, while a mere trickle joined from Spain.

Around this time the Shtetl began to emerge in Poland-Lithuanian empire. Origin dates to the 13th century.

Interesting connection between the kippa and the [Tubeteika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubeteika), or traditional headwear of steppe dwellers. 

# A chronicle of suffering

During the crusades, many Jews were forced to convert and many communities chose to self-immolate and die as martyrs. 

> Many Jews of Maeonce, Strasbourg, Spires, ... escaped from centers and left their posessesions to kindly Burgers.

![[History of Jewish Expulsions]]

# Controversial conclusions

According to Koestler, Khazars moved permanently west. Emigration from Poland followed the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, which codified anti Semitic practices by forcing Jews to wear special clothing, yellow bands and conical hats. The mostly Khazar Jews fled west from Poland Lithuania into Germany France Palestine and USA.

A big part of Koestler's thesis is that the differences between Jews and gentiles living in the same country are much smaller than difference between Jews living in different countries. Thus he claims that there is no real such thing as a Jewish race.

Apparently Koestler told French biologist Pierre Debray-Ritzen he "was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews (the ancestors of today's Ashkenazim) were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for anti-Semitism would be removed and anti-Semitism itself could disappear".


# Random stuff

- Realized that there were two Justinians. Justinian I was discussed in [[Early Middle Ages]], but here it's Justinian II Rhinotmetos (noseless). He lost his nose after being overthrown and sent into exile, but then came back and became Emperor again!
- Apparently splitting a man in twain by attaching his arms to two trees and felling them was a common penalty for adultery. Poetic Justice.
- There was a Rus invasion of Constantinople in 860, which was also described in [[Early Middle Ages]].
- Koestler keeps talking about "Russian Chronicle". Apparently it's [Nestor's letopis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Chronicle).
- Matthias Mieses is an oft-cited historian. Who was he? A German-only Wikipedia entry suggests he was a historian of Yiddish.
- Interesting analysis from the evolution perspective of Jews in the ghetto effect of them. Three things: inbreeding, genetic drift, and selection pressure.
- The Jews spoke so many languages in the past. Very flexible and dependent on the empire they found themselves in. Koestler presents a list.
- Interesting observation from Koestler in final appendix of Thirteenth Tribe: in his estimation, the greatest Jewish contributions are not in Yiddish and Ladino, but in German, English, French.

Koestler attempted to discourage misuse of his theory by hedging extensively in the conclusion, saying that Israel's right to exist is based on the UN mandate and not on Biblical covenants or genetic inheritance.

Sadly, Koestler's theory has been used extensively by Arab anti-Zionists, and white supremacists alike. Anyway, the first half is great, but the remainder can be safely skipped.

That all said, this Khazar question is historically fascinating, shrouded in mystery, and full of people on both sides, exhibiting classic motivated reasoning. We'll see where I eventually land.


Early Middle Ages
===

cover: /assets/book-covers/early-middle-ages.jpg

12 hours dedicated to the period from 300 to 1000 CE, often called the Dark Ages. The modern official nomenclature refers to the fact that sources on the time period are scarce. The lecturer distances from the colloquial usage of backwardness, decline, evil, etc. 

# Late Rome

Rome was in shambles around the third century. Wars with Persia, conflict with barbarians. The [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) saw 50 emperors in 25 years!

Diocletian finally stabilized Rome by imposing authoritarian measures. He militarized Roman society, dismantled any vestiges of the old Roman republic, and split empire in Twain, taking the eastern Roman Empire for himself. The new structure involved an emperor (title Augustus) in the east and in the west, each paired with an understudy-successor (title Caesar). Diocletian thought he was pretty dope, and changed his title from Primus inter pares (first among equals) to Dominus (master).

Constantine converted to Christianity in 312 and many followed his lead, although Senators often held out and savored their pagan traditions. The only imperial attempt to revert to paganism by Julian the Apostate completely failed. He was the only pagan emperor after Constantine.

The transition from Rome to the Fall of Rome was varied depending on locale within the Roman empire. In many areas it was quite gradual. In Rome, the last emperor's deposition in 473 had no bearing on day to day life. Commerce was still done in Roman coins, barbarian peoples still enjoyed Roman traditions. 


## St. Augustine and Early Christian thinking

St. Augustine's life is a mirror through which to try to gleam religious morality of the period. He was first inspired by Manicheanism, later Neo-platonism, and finally developed original ideas that were the basis for rigid, early Christian doctrines.

Manichaeans: inspired by a Persian school. Good and evil is in perpetual gridlock, neither able to overpower the other.

Neo-platonists: God is everything and everything is good. Some things may appear evil, but that's just because God got distracted.

Athletes of God: not sure how widespread, but around 300 CE there were many famous cases of people turning to asceticism and other extremes in the name of worshipping the Christian God.


## Fall of Rome in the west

These barbarian tribes took on a lot of Roman traditions and lifestyles. Many became practically indistinguishable from their Roman counterparts. 

In England, a distant outpost of Rome, Christianity was lost well before the last emperor, along with literacy. Interesting example of regression in civilization.

Irish monks retained their Christianity and eventually settled in Britain, bringing their religion back to England. They were extremely serious in their interpretation of monastic life. Part of this was due to the fact that Anglia retained its Celtic language which was Germanic and very different from Latin. So studying the scriptures was substantially more difficult because of the language barrier. 

When Irish monks exported their version of Catholicism to the world, including Italy and Spain, it was a hardened take on the subject. 

## Rome in the east

The eastern Roman empire lasted for a long time. Eventually it fell in 1453 due to largely to Arab invaders. The east diverged significantly after Diocletian split the empire in two. For example, it switched to Greek as the main language. 

One of the most successful Byzantine emperors, Justinian made some attempts to reunite the empire, successfully conquering the North African Vandal kingdom. He made peace with the Persians in the east, establishing an “eternal treaty”. However just as he was attempting to reconquer Italy, the Persians break the treaty and invade from the east, sacking cities and gaining territories in Palestine and Syria. This misstep, as well as the appearance of the Plague of Justinian, put an end to Justinian's ambition.

> The Plague of Justinian is the first and the best known outbreak of the first plague pandemic, which continued to recur until the middle of the 8th century. Some historians believe the first plague pandemic was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 15–100 million people during two centuries of recurrence, a death toll equivalent to 25–60% of Europe's population at the time of the first outbreak.

The Byzantine empire was constantly besieged by the Arabs from the south, by Persians from the east, and sometimes by Slavs and other barbarians from the north. Many attempts were made on Constantinople, including a [joint siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(626)) by Persian and Slav armies in 626.

# Francia after Rome

As Rome was collapsing, The Franks established Frankia, a kingdom preceding modern France. Clovis I was the best known ruler of the Merovingian dynasty. This dynasty suffered from problems of succession. They split their inheritance between children, and due to bad luck had a long strain of many child-rulers. Eventually they lost control and were replaced by the Carolingians, initially Pippin II, but later Charles Martell (the hammer), who made significant gains pushing back against the invading Arabs. 

## Iconoclasm

The pope remained tied to the Byzantine empire for many centuries after last western Roman emperor. However, as the empire became increasingly besieged it was less capable and interested in protecting assets of the church. To raise money for a large army to defend against Muslims, the Byzantine emperor Leo III instituted a new tax. But since church interests were not being adequately protected, the pope refused to pay it. [[History of the world viewed through the lens of taxes]]

Leo III then demanded destruction of holy icons, a core practice of the still unified church. It's pretty unclear why this happened, perhaps an attempt to emulate successful Islamic tradition? At any rate, the pope refused and eventually the papacy turned away from Byzantine and the East in general, so much that popes, who had long been from Greece, now weren’t sourced from there for 800 years. It's the dark ages, things are murky, but there's more speculation [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Iconoclasm).

This wasn’t quite the schism yet tho. That’s later. 

The papacy found itself without protection. The Carolingians under Pippin III (son of Charles Martel) wanted to make their ascension legitimate and saw an opportunity. To officially depose the still Merovingian king, they struck a deal with the pope: legitimate us, and we will defend your interests against the Lombards in northern Italy. Thus did the church's power and attention shift towards the West.

## Charlemagne

Charlemagne, Charles I, aka Charles Magnus, aka Charles the Great, was named after his grandfather Charles Martel, the hammer that successfully pushed back against many Arab invaders. Charlemagne eventually inherits the whole Carolingian empire, first splitting it with his brother Carloman. The names are really too much!

Charlemagne stands out as the greatest Carolingian, and reconquers more territory, including lands not originally in the Roman empire. He struggles much more against the Saxons than against the Lombards. The Saxons were primitive and distributed, actually consisting of many tiny tribes. Conversely, the Lombards were developed city dwellers with a capital city in Padua. Conquering the capital meant capitulation.

Does this generalize? Do we necessarily become less resilient as civilization progresses? Seems unlikely. [[Distributed is more resilient]]

## Carolingian Renaissance

Charlemagne's rule in the 9th century coincided with a golden age. 

Latin at this point was just a wildly evolving colloquial language which was slowly evolving into French, Spanish and Italian, depending on the region.

Around this period, Irish and Anglosaxon missionaries were spreading their faith far and wide. When they landed in the Carolingian empire, they were distinguished by their classical Latin, which remained unadulterated by their main germanic tongue. These monks found inconsistencies between many versions of holy scriptures and sought to consolidate back to their purest form. Charlemagne too did not believe in divine omniscience and insisted on addressing God in proper Latin. 

During this period, bishops became much better educated and much better stewards of the religion. Meanwhile priests remained unrefined. Priesthood tests involved with very basic questions about the faith and included an answer key, suggesting a low level of theological sophistication. Also interesting is the use of standardized testing for this purpose.

To help bring about more literacy the Carolingian Rennaisance is an early example of writing reform, helping usher in [[Carolingian minuscule]], which introduced lower case letters, spaces between words, basic punctuation, and other hints to help make reading easier.

## Treaty of Verdun

Carolingians and Merovingians both suffered from being too equitable in splitting inheritance along their heirs. This led to conflicts between the heirs often military and loss of stability. Charlemagne got "lucky", since by his death, all of his kids were dead except Louis the Pious. The Carolingian Rennaisance continued under his watch. But Louis' successors saw Carolingian power collapse. [[Primogeniture and other methods of splitting inheritance]]

Louis the Pious declared his successors when he was just 40, decades before his death. His three sons quickly rebelled against him. After an extended kerfuffle involving Louis' imprisonment to a monastery on two separate occasions, an equilibrium was reached between his three surviving children: Lothair, the eldest controlled Middle Francia (approx. Italy). Louis, a younger son from the same marriage controlled East Francia (approx. Germany), and Charles, much younger and from another marriage, controlled West Francia (approx. France).

# Carolingian decomposition: France and Germany

Under Charlemagne, the empire was subdivided into counties each governed by an appointed count, accountable to the emperor. This is a nice illustration of an anti-democratic principle at play, succinctly formulated by Fukuyama as [[Higher political bodies should be answerable to lower ones not vice versa]]. 

As the Carolingian Empire succumbed to infighting and Viking invaders, Counts began to gain more power. To secure their alliance in war, Kings began to give Counts multiple counties. The office of Count became hereditary and no longer appointed. Counts, not Kings begin appointing local bishops and abbots, and creating their own law courts. This process is known as [[Devolution of Power]]. By 900 there are 30 principalities in West Francia, many of which prevented the King from even visiting. A similar process occurred in East Francia, but instead Dukes (a level above Count) retained power. As a result, the east was less fragmented, into about 5 Dutchies. 

The West fragments fractally as Castellan do the same to their local Counts as what Counts did to Carolingian Kings. Under Charlemagne, Castellans were a public office, appointed by the ruler and non hereditary. But this breaks down as part of the process of devolution. These castelins assume titles of Dominus (Lord). Increasingly their castles are built of stone, not wood as before.

These lords then impose power in their realm, typically a 15 mile radius circle around the castle. To enforce their lordship, they hire Knights as mafia-like enforcers. Knights multiply in numbers, get fiefdoms, and we converge to feudalism.  

By this point, the King is effectively elected official, selected by Counts that hold the real power. This process of devolution is really interesting as a way of transforming a top-down hierarchy into one that turns bottom up, at least up to some rung. Clearly not all the way, since commoners, serfs and slaves were fully excluded from these power games. Does this apply to corporations in some way?

# Teutonicum / Germany

TODO
OTTO
Holy Roman Empire

# Meanwhile in Spain/Al-Andalus

Not taking too many notes here, since a lot of the material overlaps with [[Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr]]. The [[Jizya tax]] stood out as especially interesting, in the perverse incentives it created. If too many Christians and Jews converted to Islam, the Arab leaders would lose their tax base!

The visigoths in Spain were quickly overrun but Arab invaders, who established an Umayyad kingdom there, and eventually self-declared a Caliphate. 

Initially a dusty outpost of the Islamic world, by the 10th century Al-Andalus became a significant, urbanized and diverse region in Europe. The capital at Cordoba dwarfed any other European centers, with population around 100-250k. In contrast, population of Paris at the time was perhaps 20k, and London perhaps 10k.

The Arabs brought with them irrigation techniques acquired to survive in harsh deserts, relying on gravity to relay water from Oases many tens of miles away. They also brought with them new crops like rice, sugar cane and cotton, which became staples of Spanish food, and instrumental in the New World. They brought a great amount of high culture, math, and astronomy, and the region became dominant so that contemporary European mathematicians like [Gerbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II) would flock to Al-Andalus for access to the greatest minds of the time, as well as preserved writings of Greek philosophers. 

# England

Alfred the Great... zoned out a bit because it was mostly recap of [[The Story of Medieval England]].

## From Slavery to Serfdom

Fantastic historical perspective on serfdom as actually a substantial improvement to quality of life. 

Roman latifundia were large estates controlled by wealthy romans. These were mostly tilled by agricultural slaves, acquired as war booty. These slaves have no rights at all, not even to their offspring or their spouses. They could not own anything at all and generally lived in terrrible conditions. 

Estates would typically consist of one or both of these: 
1. The demesne (or domain) of the lord, which a serf is required to till some number of days a week for no pay.
2. The tenantship allotted to each serf, from which the lord gets a cut, but is fundamentally tied to the serf. Except if the serf dies childless, in which case posessions would revert to the lord by [Mortmain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortmain).

By the 10th century, slavery is mostly gone, but it’s not fully rooted.

# Feudalism

The feudal system based on lords and vassals was put in place around this same time. Vassals would swear fealty to their lords. This would grant them a fief, usually heritable property within their lord's holdings. In Latin, fief is feudum, from which feudalism comes from, and this is a central notion to the idea. In exchange for the fief, the vassal must come to the lord's aid in war, and generally give them advice when it is requested by the overlord. 

(For some reason, this reminds me a lot of a corporate structure, where the fief is a steady salary, and the war is with the code.)

Family structure changed as a result of Christianity. Completely novel ideas came about, borrowing neither from Roman nor barbarism traditions, but driven more by the church. Two interesting examples:

- Prohibition of cousin marriage, up to 6th cousins! I can barely track my lineage that far.
- Delegalizaton of concubinage, which apparently is not always as nefarious as it sounds. In Ancient Rome, concubinage "was an institution of quasi-marriage between Roman citizens who for various reasons did not want to enter into a full marriage".


# Aside on technology

## Knights

Knights first emerged during the reign of Charlemagne. They relied on a few different technologies:

- **Stirrups** from Central Asia enabled a much more stable ride. 
- **High backed saddles** increased stability especially in case of frontal impact that would normally throw you backwards.
- **Couching lances**, meaning tucking a weighted spear under your arm as you charge. This put all of the horse's momentum into the spear tip for an extremely devastating blow. 

This is a fascinating general direction, see [[Horse related inventions]].

## Viking longboats

Vikings initially were great traders, establishing vast trade routes throughout the world. Archaeological digs at [Helgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helg%C3%B6) recovered  Buddha statues from India dating to the 6th century. Eventually Viking traders turned into Viking raiders, conducting seasonal raids in the Carolingian empire and in Britain.

One of their secret weapons was the longboat, able to carry about 100 men with very shallow draft enabled transport of raiders over seas, but also critically, to enter rivers that would normally be inaccessible.

Vikings would often establish semi-permanent bases from which to conduct yearly raids on especially plentiful targets.


# Conclusion and some historiography

The Dark Ages are shrouded in mystery but two famous historians devoted their lives to studying the period.

- Edward Gibbon wrote The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in 1776
- Henri Pirenne was a Belgian historian, wrote Mohammed and Charlemagne in 1937.

Gibbon attributed the fall of Rome to Christianity. On his analysis, the religion made Romans too laconic and insufficient concerned about this world, more concerned about the world to come. As a result, they could not muster up the energy to withstand barbarism incursions. This is unconvincing since he pegs collapse at the date of deposition of the last western emperor. Meanwhile the eastern Roman empire lasts another millennium. And it’s actually the more Christian half. 

Pirenne doesn't accept that the Roman empire fell in the 5th century at all. He attributes eventual collapse to economic decline and the Arab invasions around the 8th century. 

Daileader, the lecturer, has a better explanation: depopulation. Strangely, no symptoms of depopulation appear in any of the prior lectures. It's a bit odd to conclude with a completely new insight.

According to the lecturer, Roman population declined greatly between 2nd and 7th centuries, which led to inability to defend against various Euro-barbarians, Arabs, etc. There's apparently tons of archaeological evidence for this: declining sizes of cities as witnessed by receding city walls. Main reasons for the population decline may have been diseases: The Plague of Cyprian in the 3rd century CE, the Plague of Justinian in 6th century CE (first known occurence of Yersinia pestis, the Justinianic plague), and [others](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/plagues-roman-empire/473862/).

Gibbon and Pirenne saw Carolingian period as a low point in European history. Modern historians don't associate Dark Ages with a cultural darkness or decline, but a period lacking primary sources. Culturally and economically, the Carolingian Renaissance seems to have pushed Europe out of a decline, spurred on by exchanges with Vikings who had huge trade networks, and cultural interactions with Arabs who were just ramping up.

Another GB recommendation that I really enjoyed. It's hard to summarize this book succinctly since it is such a potpourri of different fields and ideas.

# A different lens on Evolution

> Evolution is the ultimate treasure hunter, searching for nothing and finding everything

Evolution works under a constraint: whatever it produces must survive to reproduce. "Survival of the fittest" is the most popular conception of this process but does not capture any nuance. 

> The problem with competition as a general explanation for creativity is that it usually drives towards everything converging to the best. Selection is not really a creative force: It focuses and optimizes, and ultimately restricts exploration

Forces at play in evolution:

- Competition doesn't actually increase interestingness, but enforces the constraint of genetic survival.
- Genetic drift is the process by which frequency of alleles changes over time as a result of luck. If a given trait doesn’t affect an organism’s ability to survive or reproduce (for example, the color of an organism’s bones), then natural selection will not direct that trait in one way or another, and its evolution will instead drift. 
- Exaptation is the process of co-option of an evolved ability to do something else. For example, feathers first evolved in dinosaurs, where they helped to regulate temperature. Only later did evolution exploit them as a stepping stone to flight. 
- Niche finding is a way to shield an organism from competition. If an organism can make a living in a new way, then it has effectively founded its own niche. A new niche often makes founding newer niches possible, and such newer niches often lead to even newer ones.

As much as I disliked [[Finite and Infinite Games]], this discussion of evolution reminds me of it a bit. The only goal of an infinite game is to keep playing.

In an interesting twist, even our human inventions can be considered an evolutionary process since they were created by us, the products of evolution.

> The bottom line is that many of our greatest engineering aspirations—such as flight, solar power, artificial intelligence—were not the explicit objective of evolution, though it created all of them.


# Invention and stepping stones

A key metaphor often used to explain non-objective search processes is that of crossing a lake using stepping stones in dense fog.

> Because of the fog, you don’t know where either path leads. For all you know, one might lead you to a dead end while the other eventually might reach the other side of the lake. 

The dense fog is a great metaphor for [[Bounded rationality]]. The stepping stones are a good metaphor for the idea of the [[Adjacent possible]]. Each stepping stone must also be stable to support your weight as you cross, which is a great metaphor for [[Stable intermediate forms]].

> If we really behave as treasure hunters and stepping stone collectors, then the only important thing about a stepping stone is that it leads to more stepping stones, period.

The authors make sweeping claims like the following:

> Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind.

[[Profiles of the Future]] makes a distinction between expected and unexpected inventions. This book's framework applies most clearly to unexpected inventions (eg. nuclear energy). These unexpected inventions are shrouded by fog. They are too many stepping stones away to be seen. 

Expected inventions (eg. flying machines) fall less neatly into this metaphor. They are like hills above the fog, but you can't quite figure out the path to get there. On the other hand, once you get close enough to that hill, something that was completely out of reach becomes attainable.

This idea of invention as a process of groping for the next stone in the dense fog makes it clear that learnings from the history of science are inherently limited. Again that McLuhan quote about walking backwards into the future comes to mind.

> Contrary to popular belief, great inventors don’t peer into the distant future. A false visionary might try to look past the horizon, but a true innovator looks nearby for the next stepping stone. The successful inventor asks where we can get from here rather than how we can get there. It’s a subtle yet profound difference. Instead of wasting effort on far-off grandiose visions, they concentrate on the edge of what’s possible today.

This reminds me of my [[Asimov's Tech Tree]] project, and that I really should re-think it as follows. Consider an impactful modern invention and work backwards through all of the inventions its inventors were inspired by. Then repeat this process, creating a tree culminating in this invention. This view would serve to illustrate the many surprising new horizons that one invention enables. Examples include the way that looms and vacuum tubes lead to computers, and smartphones led to better batteries, and better batteries led to electric cars. Authors included a few other uncited example I found interesting:

> For example, the space race yielded innovations like cochlear implants, memory foam mattresses, freeze-dried food, and improved emergency blankets.

In many cases, the inventor is driven by a search for the interesting and novel. Art often follows this pattern too, since it is more often done for its own sake. This is a very fluid process involving a lot of gut feeling, hunches and intuition. As many inventors do this, the process compounds.

> The important point is that novelty (and interestingness) can compound over time by continually making new things possible.


# Picbreeder and other open-ended search applications

The authors rely mostly on Picbreeder, but also on other projects from their research on open-endedness to make their point, which can be boiled down to this:

> The more troubling lesson is that objective-driven search is sometimes embarrassingly incompetent.

They built a walking robot simulator and compared optimization to open-ended search. They found that the robot that tried to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply tried to do something novel again and again. They explain it like this:

> Falling down and kicking your legs may be a better stepping stone than trying to take a step (because kicking your legs is the foundation of oscillation, which is how walking works), but if walking is the objective, falling down is considered one of the worst things you can do.

They built a maze solver which would take considerably longer to solve mazes that were deceptive, meaning that they had deliberate dead-ends.

Images in [Picbreeder](http://picbreeder.org/) are generated from a DNA-like code which can *mutate* to create a different but related images. Following the evolution analogy, visitors to the website can vote on images as a form of *selection*. 

I did something similar with [[Evogami]], but with a much simpler mapping from DNA to object.

These examples are all really neat, but all deal with very specific domains: simulated walking robots, mazes, images, simulated paper. How to go from these narrow fields to something as all-encompassing as evolution remains unclear to me.

# Evolution tends towards complexity

The authors pose a good question: if single celled bacteria can do the job of reproducing, why bother creating more complex offspring?

> all organisms begin their life as single cells and end up reproducing to create offspring who also start as single cells—and this simple strategy for reproduction is effective—what objective utility is there in doing the same thing, but in more and more complicated ways?

By viewing evolution as an open-ended search process, you end up with complexity necessarily.

> As Stephen Jay Gould has pointed out in evolution, once all the simple ways to live are exhausted, the only way to create a new species or niche is to become more complex

# Strange vibes and nitpicks

> In a sense, over eons our bodies have become a kind of encyclopedia of facts about the universe in which they exist. Eyes represent the presence of light in the universe. Ears signify mechanical vibration. Legs are reflections of gravity, and lungs of oxygen.

This is suspicious. Most organs in the body are pretty mysterious from this perspective. 

A lot of this book rails against [[Perils of optimization]] and warns about maximizing meaningless metrics, along the lines of the [[McNamara Fallacy - choose meaningful metrics]] and the infamous cobra breeding story associated with [[Goodhart's law - indicators will be gamed]]. This reminds me a lot of Illich and the [[Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization]] discussion.

> You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America: school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, anything that a politician can run on, anything that someone can get a promotion on. And as soon as you invent that statistical category, fifty people in that institution will be at work trying to figure out a way to make it look as if progress is occurring when actually none is.



How to Take Smart Notes

Zettelkasten Method, In Praise of Niklas Luhmann, or Ode To The Slip-box.

The Roam cult sprang out of a practice called Zettelkasten. I refuse to join the cult, but see great value in cross-linked note taking practice. So far my tool of choice is Obsidian, mainly because I like plaintext. This book introduces the Zettel method.

> It is not possible to think systematically without writing - Niklas Luhmann

**Tools for your own thoughts**: Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” “No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.”

**A mirror of your brain**: These notes are not meant for external consumption. They are meant to be a reflection and formalization of your thoughts. As you think about a topic, your mental model of the topic evolves, as does this collection of interlinked notes. Even if your memory fades, you can return to your notes and continue where you left off.

**A communication partner**: The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to?

**Integrate seemingly unrelated sources**: This is especially powerful as a way to integrate learnings from multiple sources into one place. "When we turn to the slip-box, its inner connectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts." Read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.

**Same format, same place**: Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. No underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. Write brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. 

**Keep notes short**: By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling. This will also allow for more ready interconnections.

**Avoid premature linearization**: ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” Prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes achieves the opposite of what teachers intend to do. The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. 

**Feedback loops emerge**: The addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas. The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. It is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.

**Take it slow**: it takes time to evolve any idea, and this is another benefit of the slip-box. Related to [[Slow hunch]]. Taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place.

**Work on many ideas in parallel**: Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.

**Don't force a direction**: Luhmann’s answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities.

**Publishing by finding a path in the graph**: once you have this densely linked note cloud, and you want to cobble together an idea for others to consume, you weave a path through your graph and create a linear narrative. "We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts."


Three kinds of notes:

1. Temporary notes: which are designed to be processed and converted into something more permanent.
2. Permanent notes: (aka Matuschak's Evergreen Notes) contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way.
3. Project notes: project specific, should theoretically be kept in a separate place.

General reasons for keeping notes:

- [We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)
- Zeigarnik effect
- Charles Darwin forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories.
- Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it. Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture.

> “On one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that’s important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both … The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” - Jeremy Dean


Thinking in Systems: A Primer

Thanks to a book club at work, I finally read this legendary book.

A system is a set of entities interconnected to produce behavior over time in response to external events. For example, a slinky's behavior lies within the slinky itself. 

Modernist thinking tends to like simple causal connections. However reality is complex. Systems thinking is an interesting and valuable lens that complements high modernism. 

One way of looking at systems thinking is as a formalization of folk wisdom:

- a stitch in time saves nine
- the rich get richer, the poor get poorer
- don't put all of your eggs in one basket

# What are systems?

Systems have:

- discrete parts
- parts that interact with one another
- parts which together produce an effect that is different than each interaction

“You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand “and.” - Sufi teaching story

System components in order of importance:

- purpose / function
- interconnections 
- elements (often interchangeable, eg. employees)

Systems are composed of stocks and of flows. Stocks are the amount of a thing. Flows are the increases or decreases of said thing. Think of a bathtub with a faucet and a drain. The water in the bathtub is the stock. The faucet is the flow of water in. The drain is the flow of water out. Flows can change quickly: you can shut on and off the faucet, plug the drain. Stocks change slowly and act as buffers: even if you open the drain completely, it will still take a minute for the water to vanish.

Types of feedback loops:

- Amplifying feedback loop: the more stock there is, the higher the flow.
- Balancing feedback loop: attempts to move stock to a desired state.

Real world systems are affected by multiple feedback loops simultaneously.

# One stock systems

## Two balancing loops (eg. Thermostat)

Stock: temperature.
1. Balancing 1: Exterior temperature cools the room to be the same temperature as outside, flow is tempered by insulation, air gaps, etc.
2. Balancing 2: Heater warms the room until it is the temperature set on the thermostat.

## One amplifying and one balancing loop (eg. Population Growth)

Stock: population.
1. Amplifying: the more people there are, the more people are born. 
2. Balancing: people don't live forever. There's a death rate.

Ultimate behavior will depend on which of the two dominates. If reinforcing dominates, end up with exponential growth. Many other examples like this, such as capital growth, where the more capital you have, the more you can make, but there's also depreciation costs.

# Two stock systems

## Renewable stock constrained by non-renewable stock  (eg. Coal Mining)

Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.

Stock 2: Coal.
1. Balancing: as the coal mine depletes, it becomes harder to extract the last bits of coal. 

## Renewable stock backed by renewable resource (eg. Fishing) 

Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.

Stock 2: Fish.
1. Amplifying: the more fish there are, the more fish are born.
2. Balancing: as the population dwindles, it becomes harder to find the last fish. 


# Great insights

**Constrained by stocks vs. flows**: non-renewable resources are constrained by stocks. Renewable resources are constrained by flows. 

**Stocks act as buffers**: rivers often flood because flow >> stock. Lakes rarely do because flow << stock. 

**Delays really matter** in reality many of these loops are driven by information that is delayed. This results in oscillations.

**Stable intermediate forms**: another important concept.  Hierarchies mean that there are independent sub-systems which are independently stable. This enables a rise in complexity. 

**Limiting factors** are an intuitive but important idea. A systems is affected by the stock that is in least supply. As a system grows, the most limiting stock may change. 

**Resilience involves many balancing loops**, most of which are inactive most of the time. Example: under normal circumstances, you don't sweat or shiver. But without these abilities you would be far less resilient.

**Dominant loops** complex systems are made of multiple feedback loops, and which loop dominates the others makes a big difference. For example, in a population grouwth system, if the amplifying loop dominates, the population will grow exponentially, but if the balancing loop dominates, it will shrink.

# Stray thoughts

Firstly, what a great collection of insights! But to call it a coherent book is a bit generous. I feel like it's not well structured, and found myself picking out nuggets rather than being swept away by a coherent narrative.

It’s hard to understand as an audio book. Need visual and ideally interactive diagrams. 

Systems thinking is a great technique for CEOs, businessmen, macroeconomists. It's less clear how a pleb like me might apply it. But it's still interesting!

It would be worthwhile to contrast the causal diagrams of the sort Judea Pearl champions with these systems feedback loop diagrams.

> Praise ignorance, for what man has not encountered he has not destroyed. - Wendell Berry

# Traps and remedies

Systems have common failure modes. Here are some of the ones I found novel. The remedies are often easier said than done.

**Policy resistance**. many actors are all invested in an equilibrium involving one stock. Each pulls the supply up and down to their own benefit. Everyone exerts a lot of effort but achieves little. 
Remedy: let go. Find another thing all parties can agree on. 

**Tragedy of the commons**, a common resource or sink is overused by each user, leading to ultimate ruin because of erosion effects. The term was coined much later than I thought: in 1968. 
Remedy: either apply pressure appealing to morality/decency/religion, split and privatize the commons, or impose penalties for overuse.  

**Drift to low performance**, a gradual degradation in quality because of a moving performance goal. If quality is under the bar, the bar is set lower, often excused by sentiment like "it's not that much worse than last year", etc.
Remedy: Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Invert the pattern and set up a drift toward high performance.

**Escalation**. Cycles of violence in conflicts between countries. Negative political ad campaigns that render both candidates unpalatable.
Remedy: disarmament. This can be unilateral or mutually agreed upon, but the latter requires mediation. 

**Success to the successful** is a common situation. The more money you have, the more of it you can make through investments, etc. 
Remedy: Jubilee? Potlatch? Antitrust laws? Estate taxes?

**Dependence**, including personal addiction, but many other things. Societal dependence on institutions like healthcare, etc. 
Remedy: focus on long-term restructuring rather than short-term relief.

**Rule beating**. Example: spending all available budget just to ensure that next years isn’t reduced. Example: only slowing down if there's a police car nearby.
Remedy: redesign the rules!

**Wrong goal**, a common situation where a system pursues a goal that does not actually reflect desired outcomes. Reminds a lot of [[McNamara Fallacy]]
Remedy: 

# Leverage points 

Most attributes of the system are effectively immutable. Structure of the flows is often physical. Delays are often unavoidable. Information flows in feedback systems are where most leverage lies.  

Unbridled growth with an amplifying loop is rare because such systems quickly lead to either:
- Exhaustion of resources (eg. No more bodies to infect)
- Balancing loop dominates (eg. Greater precautions and PPE)

**Slowing growth may bring stability to a system**. Reminds me of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1357764199015849984):

> For every hundred people telling us to "just install more solar panels", only one person will consider ways to reduce power usage.

**Make invisible information visible**. During the oil embargo in 1970, the Dutch began to pay attention to power consumption. Some houses mysteriously seemed to use 30% less power than others. The difference was in location of the power meter. Those with low power usage had meter in the lobby. Others had the meter in the basement.

**Re-write the rules**. Interventions into the system's rules are very effective. This explains why lobbyists are powerful. 

**Encourage self organization**: allowing a system to self organize is extremely powerful. But this may lead to unknown conclusions, so is not well loved by those in power. 

**Goals matter**. What is the ultimate goal of the system? What’s the goal of goog? What’s the priority order of many competing goals? Sometimes a leader can do this. Hitler profoundly changed the goals of Germany in the 1930s. Reagan changed the American ethos from “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.” to “Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”

> “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” - St Exupery

**Paradigm shifts and meta paradigm awareness**. We live in a world with many unstated assumptions, hidden goals, biases. Changing these is the higest leverage point.

> There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”


Sid Meier's Memoir!
===

MJ recommended I pick up this book. I regret nothing. 

This was a fun look into game development history, narrated by a venerable insider. I remember spending days with AK and MN playing Civ 1 in the mid-90s, and have played every game in the series since.

Billed as a memoir, this book focuses on anecdotes about the games and the game industry, with Sid Meier's personal life taking the backseat. I especially enjoyed the [Nuclear Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi) story. It's such a colorful intersection of a funny premise, computer science, and a hoax.

Sid Meier's taste for non-violent educational simulators is especially compelling, and reading about these games made me really miss them. As a kid, I think Civ sparked my interest in history and war and complex systems. But I was mainly just having a lot of fun! These days playing even one game of Civ is a heavy lift, but maybe it's worth giving Civ Revolutions a look? 

What I loved most about this book was how excited I became about building games again. The intersection of games and education is extremely tricky to pull off, and I would argue that edutainment as a genre has largely failed. The holy grail is to build something that plays like a game, but whets your appetite about something insightful. This is in some sense the opposite of what explorable explanations do, which are often more interactive visualizations than games.

> Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either - Marshal McLuhan

One thing the book lacked was specific learnings and insights into game development. The chapter on the failed dinosaur game came closest, but I would have loved a whole book on this. Here are some final notes:

**Follow your interests**: Sid Meier's games have been driven by his personal interests, at least in retrospect. 

**People hate randomness**: To placate people's busted sense of randomness and overdeveloped sense of fairness, Civ Revolutions had to implement some interesting decisions: any 3:1 battle in favor of human became a guaranteed win. Too many randomly bad outcomes in a row were mitigated.

**Feedback is fact**: If a player is frustrated, this is a fact. It's not just their opinion! If a game is not fun, this is a fact the developer needs to contend with.

**Interesting decisions**: Many of Meier's games rely heavily on decision making. The decisions must be interesting. 'I wonder what would happen next time, if I did it differently?'
