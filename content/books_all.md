History of Future Cities by Daniel Brook

cover: /assets/book-covers/history-future-cities.jpg

This book explores planned cities over the centuries, built in the not-west to emulate western iconic cities: St. Petersburg, Mumbai, Shanghai, and Dubai. The whole east-west distinction is a bit funny, and the author disparages it by the end. The selection of cities is also a bit arbitrary.

I usually read books linearly, having never quite mastered the art of skimming. However in this book, each chapter covers one period of each city's history, and I decided to read the St. Petersburg sections first. I learned a lot about my birth-city, piecing together little stories that I'd known into a grander narrative, and filling in new ones. The architectural tour aspect of the book also pleasantly surprised me.

But there were also shortcomings. First, there are strange factual errors. For example, Kunstkamera was not the first public museum in the world, which the author claims (twice!). Second, liberties are taken to shoehorn the history of St. Pete into a very slick narrative centered around an idea that St. Petersburg is a fake city, a Potemkin village. This vantage point is somewhat disparaging, and profoundly western. I don't think –ü–æ—Ç—ë–º–∫–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏ have nearly the same cultural significance in Russia.

Ultimately I won't read the whole book, and can't broadly recommend this one unless you have personal ties to one of the cities.

# St. Petersburg: 1703 - 1825

German - –Ω–µ–º–µ—Ü shares a root with –Ω–µ–º–æ–π - mute. A general shorthand for all foreigners. 

Peter I traveled incognito ü•∏ thru Amsterdam as Peter Mikhailov. He got an internship at a shipyard and truly lived that life for four months. 

> Amsterdam was a kind of factory for creating modern people‚Ä¶ just as a well designed sawmill could transform rough timber into uniform usable planks so too a city, if properly designed could shape even the toughest hewn barbarians into civilized men and women. 

(Very Le Corbusier: A house is a machine for living in)

Witnessing the parliament of William III shortly after the glorious revolution, Peter remarked that it was good that the ruler was given counsel, but to be bound by any of it was an outrage. 

Peter concluded his trip to Holland with realization of importance of sea port. But Russia was landlocked, so he conquered St. Petersburg which was Swedish at the time. 

As a modernization means, Peter forced all men to shave their beards and cut off the flowing sleeves of their caftans. 

St. Petersburg was built by serfs on 6 month tours of duty. Peter ordered 40,000 a year. And they didn't even have wheelbarrows. Known as a ‚Äúcity built on bones‚Äù. Peter boasted 100,000 died building it. Reminds me of [[Roman slaves were cheaper than machines]]

Peter mandated travel by boat, but banned oars to force his people to learn how to sail by the wind alone. Nobles were gifted sailboats whose size corresponded to their rank. Peter built canals throughout the city to facilitate travel by water, but neglected to consider that they would freeze in winter.

Peter imported books on architecture and employed hundreds of foreign architects. His lead was **Dominico Trezzini**. The city arose out of imported theory rather than locally rooted processes, and tended towards extremes. 

The Kunstkamera, constructed in 1727 was the first public museum in Russia (author claims the world, but AFAICT it's The Ashmolean in Oxford, c. 1683), where Peter hoped to educate the general public. When his aides suggested he charge for entry, he even provided visitors with vodka and snacks. 

Peter began hosting concerts of instrumental music, which was illegal in Moscow because god had to be praised by the human voice alone. He imported French salons as ‚Äúassemblies‚Äù which he observed in Paris.

In Moscow, the German quarter was cordoned off from the rest of city out of fears that foreigners would corrupt the Russians with their unorthodox ways. In St. Petersburg, the –Ω–µ–º—Ü—ã were integrated and were allowed to build non-orthodox churches and even conduct services in foreign languages. 

By 1720 st. Pete had population of 40,000. Thirty years before, it was a swamp. 

Peters son Alexis did not approve of St. Petersburg, thinking it was too western facing. He attempted a coup and vowed to return the capital to Moscow. Peter sentenced his own son to death in 1717. 

Peter was succeeded by Anna, an empress and intellectual lightweight who did little and reverted to frivolity. She built the worlds largest ice palace. But she also commissioned the winter palace (hermitage) done by **Bartolommeo Rastreli**. Was she all that useless?

Catherine married Peter's grandson Peter III and took the throne in 1762. By then the city's population was 100,000. She followed in Peter's footsteps, turning it westward again. She hired **Giacomo Quarenghi**. All architects seemed to have been inspired by Palladio. 


Catherine amassed European art. Her collection of 4000 paintings rivaled what generations of French kings collected in the Louvre for four centuries. 

Catherine corresponded with Voltaire, who wrote a hagiography of Peter I. She imported Voltaire's works and invited Diderot to Russia. His stay was short lived since he had some radically egalitarian ideas. He saw Russia as a blank slate that was easier to reform than Europe. (Prescient given the communist revolution to come). Ultimately Diderot was booted for suggesting to dismantle Russian serfdom, a system of ‚Äúmasters and slaves‚Äù, which was the last straw. 


> Not only was the empress seeking advice from foreign experts when Peter had vowed that Russia would ‚Äúshow Europe its ass‚Äù, but when they offered advice to empower the people, the empress refused to take it. 

Catherine did take some advice. And attempted to bring open debate by running public salons in the winter palace. But the French Revolution of 1789 changed this openness. And her lieutenant Radischev wrote a French Revolution inspired ‚ÄúJourney from St. Petersburg to Moscow‚Äù, highly sympathetic to the plight of serfs, including plans for abolition. This closed the window for Catherine and Russia was firmly an autocracy. 

> Open debate would reign within the winter palace even as autocracy prevailed outside its walls. 

When Alexander I, grandson of Catherine, defeated napoleon and entered Paris in 1814, Peter the Great's vision of modernity without democracy was fulfilled. Russia was compared to Rome and Alexander I went on a building spree, rapping **Carlo Rossi**, who trained in Rome. He was most famous for the general staff building and an arch. 

French influences were still prominent even after 1814. **Auguste de Montferrand** redesigned the St. Isaac's cathedral. In his bid he presented oil paintings of many possible styles: Indian, Chinese, Byzantine, green etc. but the choice was obvious: giant gilded neoclassical dome. Just like the best of Europe!

As the Russian army marched through Europe pursuing the fleeing armies of Napoleon, they saw what Europe was like, and how much more advanced it was than Russia economically, socially, educationally and politically. St. Pete‚Äôs in contrast began to seem like a ‚ÄúGiant Potemkin village‚Äù.

This planted the seeds of the Decembrist revolt, organized by six members of the imperial guard, who wanted to bring constitutional government to Russia. Waiting for a succession, they vowed to make a move during the chaos that would ensue. Instead, they were massacred in front of the Hermitage.

Subsequently, to tamp down future rebellions, Nicholas I instituted a secret police to watch dissent, suggested that European travelers come back with criticism, and pared back liberal arts education to focus on technical subjects instead. The window to the west was closing. 


# St. Petersburg: 1825 - 1934

Mind blowing connection of the Russian word –≤–æ–∫–∑–∞–ª named after the first train station in Tsarskoe Selo, modeled after Vauxhall station in London. ‚ÄúA permanent reminder of Russia's cribbed modernity at its most blatant‚Äù.

Fittingly, the first railway line connected the capital with the tzar's residence, a vanity project. Meanwhile, a national railway network was nixed out of fear that ‚Äúfrequent purposeless travel would foster the restless spirit of our age‚Äù. Reminds me of the crackdown on [[Parasitism in Soviet Russia]].

Funny: when European fashions changed to wearing facial hair, Petersburgers followed suit, reversing Peter's decree. Gogol mocks this in ‚ÄúNevsky prospect‚Äù.

The Crimean War loss at the end of Nicholas I's rule was a wake up call. His son Alexander II took the reigns and undid many of the harshest policies of his predecessors. He freed the serfs in 1861, freeing 22 million people and set Russia up for an industrial path.

Sept 1 1861: St. Petersburg University Rebellion demanding a democratically elected leader not a tzar. I've never heard of this, nor had dad, and so I dug in a bit. The author claims "the university was closed outright for two years", while [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Imperial_University) "it was temporarily closed twice during the year".

Narodniks were student intellectuals that went to the people (–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥) to try to spread revolutionary ideas. First they tried with pamphlets but the peasants were illiterate (hmm... really?). Then they tried with speeches and the peasants reported them to the tzar. By 1877, 1600 students were imprisoned in Peter and Paul fortress. 

The radicals adopted another strategy. A new organization, The People's Will began to assassinate key regime officials. Alexander II had his liberal interior minister draw up plans to ease censorship, abolish secret police and allow elected representatives to vote in national affairs. Alas, the peoples will succeeded after six attempts to assassinate the tzar. 

Instead of triggering a revolution, they triggered succession, and Alexander III was far more conservative than his father. Rather than moving the capital back to Moscow, he brought Moscow to St. Petersburg by erecting a large cathedral: Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. This structure designed by an archimandrite (orthodox title) with no architectural background, stood out like a sore thumb in the middle of the city. ‚ÄúA deliberate intrusion of the real Russia onto the Petersburg scene‚Äù.

Alexander II spurred economic development and sent his finance minister Michael von Reutern to pitch Russia as an emerging market with western conveniences and convenient labor practices. Workers were cheap, had no rights, no ability to speak freely, publish, march, or vote. This was a resounding success and Russia grew at 8% per year from 1860-1900. The Russia American red triangle rubber factory üî∫üè≠ was built then. My grandparents worked there for decades. That's where they met.

Meanwhile the city was densifying as more and more peasant workers were moving in. Soon it was twice as crammed as Paris, Berlin, or Vienna. The death rate was highest of all European cities in 1870. Peterburgers topped the nation in vodka consumption, crime was rampant, prostitution was legal and ubiquitous.

Mass education was one of the rare successful social endeavor in St. Petersburg around this time. By 1910, 80% of the population was literate, and this mass literacy was a social innovation the elite would come to regret.

Singer Sewing Machine an example of another company establishing Russian HQ. The Singer Building was architecturally notable. One of many, though.

Putilov Works was a giant ironworks employing 12,000 people, operated by the richest merchant oligarch family of the era. Attempts were made to control them by building incongruous churches adjacent to the plant, but this failed. Eventually, under Gregory Gapon, workers organized and went on strike when four of them were fired for joining the union. In 1905, a general strike extended to 120,000 Petersburgers. A petition was extended demanding freedom of speech, press and assembly, free public education, minimum wage, an eight hour work day, and legalization of unions.

Five thousand protesters led by Gapon were joined by curious sympathizers as they marched along Nevsky prospect. By the time they converged onto the Winter palace, 60,000 men, women, and children awaited. What followed was a massacre claiming 1,000 lives called ‚ÄúBloody Sunday‚Äù, when Tzarist troops opened fire. What followed was a revolution in which the weak tzar Nicholas II, recently defeated by Japan, escaped to Tsarskoe Selo. Eventually the people got what they wanted: autocracy was abolished and a parliament (the Duma) was founded.

However this democratic stint was short lived. In 1906, nearly half of the Duma‚Äôs representatives were rural peasants, underscoring Russia‚Äôs backwardness (really?). Further, Nicholas II dissolved the Duma and called for new elections. He did this repeatedly to limit the socialists in its ranks.

Nicholas II became increasingly insular, hiding from the people in Tsarskoe Selo. He pined for the Russia before Peter the Great turned westward, adopting the title tzar (instead of emperor, preferred by Peter and used by many Russian monarchs). He wore a beard, a caftan with long impractical sleeves, and commissioned his architects to build the [Feodorov village](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80_(%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD)), a mini walled town modeled after the 17th century. 

In St. Petersburg, he built the Romanov Tercentenary to commemorate the 300 anniversary of Romanov rule.

World War I gave Nicholas the opportunity to turn populist. A crowd of 250,000 sang ‚Äú–±–æ–∂–µ —Ü–∞—Ä—è —Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏‚Äù, and then burnt the German embassy to the ground. He renamed the city to Petrograd since ‚Äúburg‚Äù was viewed as too German. No matter that it was named after Holland.

But the jubilation was short lived, and massive casualties begat draft dodgers, crowds chanting ‚ÄúDown with the autocracy‚Äù, singing the Marseillaise, and rioting. Police stations, prisons, courthouses were torched. Protesters were killed by the dozens, and soon the army refused to fire on more people.

Nicholas abdicated the throne and gave up power to his brother, who also refused it. A temporary government was set up under Kerensky.

Some concessions were given to the labor movement: an eight hour work day. But real wages plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed. 

Lenin‚Äôs Bolsheviks called for national transformation, echoing Peter the greats conviction he could autocratically wrench Russia into the modern world without having to wait for more organic development from below. 

After the successful October revolution, Lenin found himself in a civil war which erupted against an alliance of opponents aided by anti-communist western powers like Britain, France, and the USA. The capital was moved from Petrograd to Moscow for military strategic reasons. 

In the Kremlin centuries ago, a bearded theocratic elite ruled Russia following eternal truths of church teachings. Now a new class of grey men would rule according to the holy canon of official Bolshevik doctrine. (Really?)

After the civil war was won and the whites were crushed, major changes came to St. Petersburg. Originally the gateway through which European ideas including Marx‚Äôs flowed into the country. When Lenin came to power, new ideas became a threat. Lenin quickly set up the Cheka secret police to stifle Petrograd's ‚Äúembittered bourgeoisie intelligencia‚Äù. Meanwhile wages fell and food became scarce and Petrograd dropped from 2.3 million in 1918 to 0.7 million in 1920 (!!) as workers returned to their villages and became peasants again. (Shocking drop‚Äî was it due to foreign divestment?)

Worker strikes spread to the naval installation of Kronstadt, and 10,000 sailors rose up against Bolshevism. The rebellion was crushed violently but made Lenin lay off Petrograd and give the city a bit of breathing room. When Lenin died in 1924 the city was renamed in his honor. 

Meanwhile Russia felt to the exterior world like once again a promising blank slate as under Catherine the great. This time there were more talented Russians  to lead the charge. 

The Bauhaus movement found eager home in the Soviet state. [Tatlin's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatlin%27s_Tower) was an ambitious modern example of such a project but was never built for lack of funds. 

Constructivism became Russia's distinctive style of modernism integrating obsession with geometry and perspective. Example: [Palace of Culture](http://architectuul.com/architecture/gorky-palace-of-culture). [Tractornaya Ulitsa](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2301/on-tractor-street) homes were a tasteful update on classic Petersburg forms. I'm reminded of [[Palaces for the People by Eric Klinenberg]], just making the connection from the name.

**Erich Mendelssohn** was brought to design red banner factory in 1925, which looked like a giant ocean liner ready to set sail. 

This period of early soviet avant-garde was short lived as cultural conservatives gained the upper hand, chief among them Stalin. 

> As in the Age of Enlightenment, Russia‚Äôs window on the west birthed dreams of a glorious future only to smother them. 


# St. Petersburg: 1934 - 1985

Using Kirov‚Äôs murder as pretext, Stalin issued an order expediting political investigations. The soviet constitution did guarantee some civil liberties, but these no longer applied. It‚Äôs now widely believed that Kirov was killed on Stalin‚Äôs orders too. Anyway, the result was a giant supposed conspiracy in which thousands of Russians were accused of being in cahoots with western capitalist powers.

The Great Purge ultimately took millions of people. Not just active party cadres, but anyone politically or intellectually active, including my great grandfather. ‚ÄúBlack Ravens‚Äù would come by night in black vans and disappear ‚Äúenemies of the people‚Äù. And most of these were in Leningrad, a gateway to western ideas which helped launch the revolution, and was now such a threat to the new regime.

Stalin likely admired Hitler‚Äôs June 1934 Night of the Long Knives, in which he orchestrated murder of his fellow Nazi Party founders.

During his decades of rule, Stalin hardly ever set foot in Leningrad, made many attempts to downgrade it to just another city. Even in the first five year plan in 1928, Stalin focused on industrializing the rest of the country, divesting from Leningrad. The Bolsheviks renamed the streets around –°–ø–∞—Å –Ω–∞ –ö—Ä–æ–≤–∏ after the names of the murderers of Alexander II, but Stalin changed the names back, to ensure those that rise up against their leaders were not glorified.

Stalinist architecture was built with neoclassical facades, replacing modernist avant-guard of the old soviet state. These structures were massive and imposing, a return to order reminiscent of the Romanovs, but also epitomizing high modernism. An example of this is House of the Soviets, and everywhere, giant statue of Lenin loomed.

Hitler called Leningrad ‚Äúthe poisonous nest from which, for so long, Asiatic venom has spewed forth into Europe‚Äù, and aimed for full destruction. Awesome!

Head of Hermitage **Iosif Orbeli**, anticipating German invasion, packed half a million objects and sent them east to Sverdlovsk just before the Germans severed the rail connections, as the city was falling apart.

By 1941, the Germans had fully cut off food supplies from Leningrad. Once the crumbs were consumed, tens of thousands of died a month. People survived eating binding glue from books, boiling belts into thin soup, eating mysterious meat patties. Over a million died in the 900 day siege. And this is not ancient history ‚Äî my grandfather lived through this.

Stalin may have been deliberately slow to stop the siege, as he watched the city he hated be crushed by Nazi air raids. The Smolny party headquarters were camouflaged, while great buildings like St. Isaac‚Äôs and the Admiralty were not. And party members were not starving like the commoners. Their only wartime rule was: no seconds of meat!

Throughout all this in 1941, a strike broke out at Kirov Works (formerly Putilov Works), where strikers demanded an end to Stalin‚Äôs Russia. This in the context of being fully cut off from the rest of Russia was a fascinating political threat from within. 

The history associated with this period did not jive well with the party line. The curator of the Blockade Museum, which opened a few months after the end of the war, was promptly shot, and museum closed. Even the official Monument to the Defenders of Leningrad did not open until the 70‚Äôs.

Stalin's personality cult continued, and globalism was further curtailed. The Internationale, which called for universal proletarian solidarity was replaced with the soviet anthem, which name dropped Stalin. International Prospect was renamed after Stalin too.

In menial jobs there was no pressure to join the Party, so people took them, punched in, and spent the workday writing music and poetry. 1949 confiscation of saxophones. What.

Never heard of "–°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥" the punk band, actually pretty good, look up –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –†–µ–∫—à–∞–Ω.

# St. Petersburg: 1985 - ~now

Under Gorbachev the city turned westward again and people made great strides in civil rights, especially of speech and assembly. 

**Angleterre Hotel**, a historical landmark was due to be razed in 1987. A crowd gathered to protest and the leader was told by officials that no such thing would happen. Half an hour later the hotel was demolished. A sign of the times, rather than dispersing the crowd stood its ground and formed an ‚Äúinformation point‚Äù, dissenting in public. Known as Battle of the Angleterre.

In the **Mikhailovsky Garden**, Peter's assemblies and Catherine‚Äôs salons were revived on Saturday afternoons. This ‚ÄúHyde Park‚Äù was shutdown and then moved to Nevsky prospect!

I didn't know the new name of the city was decided by popular referendum in June 1991. Choices were Leningrad and St. Petersburg. Solzhenitsyn wanted Svyato-Petrograd which is a bit awkward, and never made ballot. 

Anatoly Sobchak, former head of Leningrad Soyuz was elected as head of Leningrad mayor of St. Petersburg. He aimed to turn the city into a special economic zone after China. He established ties with us universities and mega corps like Coca Cola and Gillette began opening offices in St. Pete. 

Rather than a China-style transition to market economy slowly weaning unproductive industry from subsidies, St. Pete endorsed immediate removal of price controls, calling it ‚Äúshock therapy‚Äù. The result was skyrocketing prices, "all shock and no therapy". Interesting debate about Shock Therapy between Joseph Stiglitz (against) and Jeffrey Sachs (in favor). Look into it later.

Major industries were converted into private companies and Russians were given a share worth 20$ of the new companies. Ownership was soon concentrated by those that had secretly accumulated money, taking advantage of cash strapped Russians. These new oligarchs rather than build up the companies, decided to sell everything and, and make out like bandits, literally. The St. Petersburg economists that endorsed this were so taken by the beauty of their theories that they were blinded by the damage on the ground. They became known as "Market Bolsheviks".

Western firms found that they needed to be headquartered in Moscow, since that is where the clique in power was based. Even Maersk, the Dutch shipping giant, moved their Russian headquarters to landlocked Moscow.

The early 90s were extremely rough: from 1990 to 1995, the number of Russians living on $4 a day or less went from 2M to 60M. Life expectancy went from 68.5 to 64.5. "everything Marx said about communism was wrong, but everything he said about capitalism was right"

By 1998, the ruble had collapsed. This economic chaos began to be associated with democracy in the Russian mind, and the people pined for a strong leader. Putin's Russia would be autocracy reborn. The next bits go into Putin's biography, mostly a rehash of [[Nothing is True and Everything is Possible]]. Notably Putin consolidated TV networks under state control. Gasprom, the giant government owned conglomerate, benefited greatly from spikes in oil demand in the early 21st century. 

The last St. Pete gubernatorial election was in 2003. In 2004, a law was passed that makes heads of all "federal subjects" (provinces, republics, territories, federal cities like St. Pete) appointed directly by the President of Russia. In the west we have checks and balances. In Russia we have check and mate (I made that up)

Valentina Matviyenko, Putin's puppet established the city as a Potemkin village, polishing the center but letting the heart rot. Russian visas are hard to come by, but it's very easy to get a 48 hour visa if you're coming to St. Pete on a Baltic cruise. Just enough time to get the "wow feels so european" vibe, spend some Euros, and get the fuck out.

# Overarching themes

- Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Alexander II, Lenin and Gorbachev all embraced western ideas, and brought foreign influence to Russia and St. Pete.
- But this spurred on a powerful countervailing force administered by rulers like Alexander I, Nicholas I, and Stalin that wanted Russia to look inwardly.
- Even the western facing rulers avoided embracing political freedom and democracy. The trend continues to this day.
- Great architecture, often built by foreign architects or under the auspices of some great Italian or French designs.
- The Russians cribbed from the French. But the Germans cribbed from the Romans, and the Romans cribbed from the Greeks. 

> That the Romans copied doesn't mean that history is nothing but copying, but it does mean that copying is an integral part of history. [...] The US too, like the Germans and the Romans, consciously wrote itself into the western tradition.

The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism by Max Weber
===
rating: yes
posted: September 26, 2021
cover: /assets/book-covers/weber-protestant-ethic.jpg

Max Weber piqued my interest in an overview course in philosophy [[The Modern Political Tradition - Hobbes to Habermas]]. I took a note about Weber's ideas then:

> Work is good in itself, a sign of higher character. Modernity is all about instrumental rationality: refining means to achieve ends. Modernity is polytheistic. Each context provides its own value. This leads to a permanent identity crisis. Weber‚Äôs options are: bear with it or return to an all encompassing religion. (Protestant capitalism)

When GB suggested that Weber's translated works were readable, I decided to take the plunge. Weber is sometimes long winded. The last sections seem to go deep into narrow protestant sub-sects and associated thinkers. Zinzendorf, Herrnhut and the Pietists were just a bit too much for me. I found this section to be repetitive and overly detailed. But other times, the text was so dense and rich I actually had to slow the audio book narration to below real-time, which is a first for me. If you are tempted to skim, be sure to read the last chapters.

According to Weber, Protestants in general are characterized by a strong piety and a remarkable proficiency at their trade. 

> [Striking] is the connection of a religious way of life with the most intensive development of business acumen among those sects whose otherworldliness is proverbial as their wealth

When I think of a devoutly religious person, I think of them giving their whole life to god. My intuitive model is that of the Baal Shem Tov who spent every waking minute reading the Torah. Or a ‚Äúathlete of god‚Äù who turns to extreme asceticism as a reaction to excesses of the established clergy.

Weber makes a sharp distinction: the Protestant work ethic is diametrically opposed to 1) joie de vivre and also to 2) aspirations for worldly progress. Instead, this work ethic is one tied to a deep faith. He cites Montesqieu, that the English have "progressed the farthest of all peoples of the world in three important things: in piety, in commerce, and in freedom." Weber's work focuses on the relationship between the first two.


# Satisfaction vs. acquisition

Interesting distinction between:

1. Satisfaction of needs and
2. Acquisition beyond those needs. 

Economic traditionalism is exemplified in (1). But capitalism is mostly (2), an acquisitive economy. 

The acquisitive economy relies on money and wealth as a measure of how well you have done your job. 

The idea of a calling irrational and is associated with Protestantism according to Weber. He will tease this out in chapter 3. 

# The Calling: from monasticism to craftsmanship

Luther said that the fulfillment of worldly activity is the best way to worship the lord. 

In the early Catholic Church, the notion of a calling was often applied to a monastic lifestyle. Worldly duties were derided. The individual should stay in the station he was given at birth and glorify god.

Luther translated this notion into something much more worldly. Religious authority was not reduced, but the calling could force you to pursue a path divergent from the station provided at birth. 

The emphasis thus shifted from an unending glorification of god to a creation of god-glorifying works, fruits of your craft. I think of J. S. Bach as an exemplar of this attitude. Even mom has said that at her best, her hands are moved by god's grace.

The emphasis on works reminds me of [[Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro]], in which students' works are harvested in order to prove that clone-students are worthy of salvation.

Weber enumerates protestant denominations that contributed to this solid work ethic:

- Calvinism/Reformed (Presbyterians)
- Pietism, a Calvinist-adjacent branch within Lutheranism. 
- Methodism, which split off from Anglicanism.
- Sects from the Baptist movement.

# Brief aside on protestant sects

I've always found protestant denominations to be very confusing, and here's [a
diagram I found helpful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism#/media/File:Protestant_branches.svg).

I also spent a couple of hours trying to understand a bit beyond what the book has to offer, and here are my findings:

- Not all branches of Protestantism stem from Luther directly. Some seem to be inspired by his disobedience, but don't inherit from Lutheranism directly.
- Anglicanism was started by Henry VIII, a few decades after Luther (details of the story I will skip here). Puritans dissented against the Anglican church, demanding extreme divergence from Catholicism. 
- Methodists are a sort of Puritan revival, also splitting off from Anglicans. Their name comes from "method".
- Weber refers to Moravians. These are followers of Jan Hus (mentioned in [[Late Middle Ages]], and predates Luther by sixty years (!)
- Speaking of schisms, it's fascinating to watch two different strategies in the Christian world:

  1. Catholic schisms and re-unifications, all the while maintaining a unified organization.
  2. Protestant forks and a branching hierarchy of denominations.

# Predestination and its implications

The strongest formulation of Calvinist concept of double predestination was that before birth, all people were destined to either go to heaven or burn in hell, regardless of their deeds. And which bucket you fell into was unknown until your death. For Calvin, man is created for god, not god for man. His decrees thus don‚Äôt need to be pleasant in the slightest. For the damned to complain of their lot is the same as animals complaining that they were not born as men. For god to change his mind on the basis of some earthly human actions would diminish his power. Puritans share the same view of predestination as Calvinists.

For Luther, the doctrine of predestination was initially important, but faded over time. The Lutheran concept of predestination is "single predestination", meaning that some people are pre-destined for salvation, but nobody is pre-destined for damnation.

This was a huge difference between Catholicism and Calvinism/Puritanism: for the Puritans, no amount of sacrament or worship was going to get you into heaven. So they deliberately avoided doing any ritualized burial, as that was seen as superstition. From this stemmed a general aversion to anything sensuous and emotional in culture and religion. These are no use towards salvation, merely deluding people via idolatrous superstition. 

**Against magic**: For the Puritan, the Catholic tradition looked as if ‚Äúthe priest was a magician who performed the miracle of transubstantiation and held the key to eternal life in his hand‚Äù. As a result, they made their project to "eliminate magic as a means of absolution".

**Individualism**: This doctrine forms the roots of a disillusioned individualism. Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" is the most read Protestant book. The protagonist named Christian abandons his family to escape from the "City of Destruction" (this world), to the "Celestial City" (heaven). Once safe, he remembers that he should probably also bring his family too...

**Self-confidence**: The elect and the damned do not differ in any way. This wasn‚Äôt a problem for Calvin, who felt himself obviously chosen. But for many others was not tenable, as everyone would wonder endlessly whether they are in a state of grace. The result is that all people must act with self confidence as if they are in a state of Grace, and avoid doubt at all cost. (The basis of high self confidence in the west?)

**Unbounded piety**: In this view, Catholics live with ‚Äúhand to mouth‚Äù piety. They try to be good but inevitably stray from the ideal, and then need to offset their misdeeds via confession or sacrament. In contrast, the Puritan would need to act as if they were in a state of grace, constantly are outdoing themselves in their piety. There is no upper bound on piety if you are truly one of the chosen. (Does this piety then translate into money in the modern age?).


(Is there predestination in Judaism?)


# Emphasis on works

This more modern interpretation of the calling is intimately tied to producing great works. For Lutherans it wasn‚Äôt enough to do righteous works. They insisted on an emotional component. For them, the feeling of grace was needed to actually attain salvation (aka state of grace). For a Calvinist this was just empty emotion.

According to the Puritans, works are not the cause but only the proof of a state of grace, and only if the works are done for the glory of god alone. He who did not perform good works was not a true believer. The harshness of Calvinism continues to astound.

# Ben Franklin's post-religious take

At first Weber appears to lambaste Ben Franklin for being overly pragmatic as he describes the ‚Äúspirit of capitalism‚Äù, in a passage from his autobiography. Franklin's virtues are all merely a means to an end. In the end, if you are virtuous, you will have good standing with money lenders. This uncharitable take is very easy to mock, and has been done effectively by Ferdinand Kurnberger, who in "Picture of American Culture" describes Americans thus: "They make tallow out of cattle and money out of men."

But Weber gives Franklin a much more charitable interpretation. Franklin's response to ‚Äúwhy should money be made from men?‚Äù comes from his strict Calvinist father: 

> Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings. ‚Äî Proverbs 22:29

On Weber's account, Franklin philosophy as written in his autobiography is not greed at all, but a direct continuation of puritan ideals. Franklin was a self avowed deist, far less religious than his pious Puritan predecessors. 

# Three attitudes to wealth

1. Wealth for its own sake, because of the desire to be wealthy. (Greed)
2. Wealth for the sake of a carefree life. (Sloth)
3. Wealth as a side effect of following your calling. 

The Calvinist/Puritan tradition holds that (3) is acceptable, but the rest are sinful. If your calling happens to be entrepreneurship, then wealth of your company is basically the explicitly endorsed goal. 

Another pious angle on accumulating wealth is one of eventually giving it away. This idea of "earning to give" is quite old. 

# Modernity (well, circa 1905)

And so Max Weber us forced into this mandatory system of a calling, works, originally set out as an optional path.

> The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresitible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter‚Äôs view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the ‚Äúsaint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.‚Äù But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage.

Weber ends with a meta point. Modern man consistently underestimates the importance of religious influences in shaping modernity.


ABC by Illich and Sanders

The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind is an interesting deep dive into the way
that consciousness evolved throughout history, especially as a result of
literacy. I guess this is the Illich version of Orality and Literacy (which I
have not yet read). 

In general, the book is overly declamatory, often feels like a sermon. Parts of it are more literary critique, especially where Illich/Sanders delves into specific literary works (Chaucer's Canterbury, Defoe's Journal, Twain's Huck Finn) and tries to make sweeping generalizations based on their novels. Arguments rely mostly on wordplay and clever assertions, but are often unconvincing.

Sections correspond to chapters in the book that I thought were vaguely interesting:

# Text

The spread of writing turned society upside down in almost every domain. But the authors consider the subtler side. Everything we know about that society is conveyed to us through writing, including everything we know of the oral tradition of the time, leading to a paradox of ‚Äúoral writing‚Äù. 

With literacy, trust shifted from a spoken promise in the form of an oath, to a sealed document. Oaths were a conditional curse: let me be maimed if I break this promise. Formerly formulaic speeches like the Danes ‚Äúby the ships side and the shields rim, by the swords edge and the horses thigh‚Äù, ritualized by raising weapon skyward and placing a foot on a stone. Instead of oaths, literacy led to a more legal and binding form of promise. It‚Äôs no surprise that we now use the book in the ‚Äúpantomime of legal gesture‚Äù. 

Authors points to a rapid increase in writing in the 13th century based on consumption of parchment and sealing wax. According to some records (uncited?), the numbers were 3 pounds a week in 1226, 13 in 1256, 31 in 1266. Similarly, the authors point to the number of recorded royal decrees  1080-1180: 3 to 60 for French kings, 25 to 115 for the English, 22 to 180 for popes. After that it‚Äôs exponential. From Pope Innocent III ending in 1215, 280 survive, Innocent IV ending in 1254, 730 survive, Boniface VIII ending in 1303, 50000.

Wills also became determined not by last words on the deathbed or a symbol imbued with meaning but by a sealed document. This transition happened in 12th century when symbols began to be engraved with explicit writings. 

Written documents also enabled trust to be formalized. The issuer would create two copies: one for themselves and one for the recipient. Technical details around this included the seal, a signature, a date, creating a copy and storing it in a catalog, which is part of a register. 

High Middle Age monks simply remembered where things were without a system. Earliest known scrutinium (monastic catalogs) were introduced in 1170. This is also the advent of libraries. 

Writing enabled exact copying of materials, which became desirable. In 1283 Cambridge hired its first corrector whose job was to check documents according to form, legibility, word order, and spelling. Documents being identical became a criteria for legal validity. 

> Two hundred years before Gutenberg, archives gave rise to the intellectual prototype of printer matter: an original from which a number of identical copies had been produced and written. 

Even people required ‚Äúidentification‚Äù (written credentials that are identical to your person). No wonder the domesday book doesn't include a list of people ‚Äî there was probably no accounting of individuals at all at the time.

Around this time a written chronicle of time emerged too, an essential piece of cataloging many charters. Notaries would travel around and witness and date major transactions around them, from the birth of the Lord. This gave a new dimension to text: time. Documents could be ordered by recency. Time in general grows in importance as a result. In the dance of death genre, the hourglass is prominently displayed. Time is scarce. 

In the 12th century, news needed to be proclaimed orally (by a herald, ‚Äúheard‚Äù) for it to be official. The written copy (if any) was just a record of the oral delivery. A signet ring served as seal and was accompanied with arbitrary and ever changing signature. But then as courts became more concerned with authenticity, this practice changed into the 14th century and onwards. The author also writes that vellum (calf) was replaced with membranum (sheep) supposedly thinner, harder to erase and prevented forgeries. (This is surprising since I think vellum was more sought after). Slowly text became the medium of guarantee. 

This is reflected in art: The Last Judgement involves the Archangel Michael depicted with a book in which the text of ones life is recorded and decisions made. 

Early ‚Äúwriting‚Äù did not involve clutching a pen and drawing letters on parchment, but dictating to a scribe. So initially there was a gulf between writer and author. Wax tablets also played some role in writing, mostly for temporary note taking. (Interesting that this hasn't really been a focus in other works I've read on this topic.)

Words were initially not separated at all, but spaces between became common around the 7th century (confirm with [[Carolingian minuscule]]), in order to teach Latin to the barbarians as a foreign language. 

Previously writing was arduous, inscribed with a knife on hard leather. New script emerged in the 13th century. This more circular cursive writing was easier to write using a quill on a smooth surface, on parchment or paper. By the 13th century scholars like Thomas Aquinas were writing on their own without the need for scribes, and drafts are preserved. 

Later scholars had access to much smaller books which were portable and used as a reference enabling direct quotation from sources. But so far all quotations had to be made verbatim, since books were not structured in any way until 12th century. 

Also see [[Reading and writing transition in the 12th century]].

In addition to structured catalogs and libraries, books themselves became structured. Chapters and verses became the somewhat arbitrary superstructure placed after the fact over top the Old Testament only in 1200 (!). 

Previously text and images were deeply interwoven. The [Book of Kells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtQAsvUiwPg) and the [Lindisfarne Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Gospels) provide two such examples. Now a monolithic text heavy manuscript was gaining shape, with structure and chapters and quotes separated visually from the rest of the content. 

Another major change was that rather than always reading aloud, reading became a mostly silent pursuit. 

# Self

I enjoyed the Text chapter of this book, so decided to read on. The section on self is basically a great takedown of autobiographies. 

> Autobiography is born out of hubris. In Franklin's case his autobiography grows out of the hubris of America‚Äôs emerging power - its myths and ideals - a power that actually thrives on mistakes. One merely seized upon them as Franklin makes clear and turns them into substantial financial success. Autobiography amplifies that power: since a person is literally creating a new being, he can smooth out the rough transitions in his life, clean up the mistakes to produce a polished and attractive literary self. 

> A chief obstacle to writing a modern autobiography is its ending. How can it end, really, reach its final conclusion, until the writer is dead?

Malcolm X's autobiography is published posthumously. Maybe that's the ticket?

# Untruth and narration

Love the Latin expression ‚Äúex suo digito suxit‚Äù - –≤—ã—Å–æ—Å–∞–Ω–æ –∏–∑ –ø–∞–ª—å—Ü–∞ - sucked out of ones finger. Finger and fiction are apparently connected through this? But I haven't been able to verify.

St Augustine defined every lie as an assault on the God given truth. A contempt of God. Fascinatingly this precludes fiction in the traditional sense of being fully invented. Epic bards retell old stories that really happened, not fictions. Storytellers too, are not inventing but retelling. Chaucer (1386) is supposedly the first English author to spin a tale. But he does this not explicitly, couching heavily. 

Chaucer writes just as England is moving from a culture of orality to literacy. And finds himself in an awkward position between fact and fiction. He needs to have Canterbury story taken as truth ‚Äúfor this is the way readers come to enter into any fictional dream‚Äù and goes to great lengths to do this. He makes himself one of the pilgrims, and tells a story ‚ÄúTale of Sir Thopas‚Äù which is so boring that the fictional hosts ask him to stop. But apparently ‚Äútoo much truth can get Chaucer into theological trouble‚Äù. Why???

Defoe writes a book entitled "Journal of the Plague Year" which is a semi-fictional journal of a man living in London in 1665, the last major plague outbreak. Authors claim that this is the first novel, but this is completely ludicrous. In fact Robinson Crusoe came before this Journal, which immediately nullifies many of the claims made. There are [many other candidates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_claimed_first_novels_in_English) for first novel too. Anyway, the authors really focus on the word ‚Äúnovel‚Äù and how it is closely related to ‚Äúnews‚Äù and shares the Latin root ‚Äúnovus‚Äù, new. Who cares?

By this point it is clear that this chapter has evolved into speculative literary criticism with very tenuous arguments based on word games. The end is especially cringeworthy, with a vast narrative being cobbled together on the basis of the three works encountered. It‚Äôs very shaky and very ideological and not convincing at all. A little reminiscent of Deschooling, but worse.

# Newspeak and UNIQUACK

Speculative literary criticism continues into the 20th century, this time with Orwell's 1984. Fascinating pointers, but not much substance. 

Basic English was a subset of English (less than 1000 words) popular in the 1950s as a universal language designed to increase international collaboration. Apparently Orwell was into it initially, then worked for the institute promulgating it and realized this was a terrible idea.

The authors declare that words like energy, sexuality, transportation, education, communication, information, crisis, problem, solution, are too vague, and ‚Äúamoeba-words‚Äù. I don't understand why. Many of these have precise meaning depending on context. Maybe the authors felt that people don‚Äôt generally know these precise meanings and misuse them?

# Silence

Authors introduce an idea of ‚Äúalphabetic silence‚Äù: pauses between words, silent contemplation of text, meditative thought. 

I enjoyed the interpretation of the Ten Commandments. What did the Israelites hear when they received the ten commandments? A few theories:

1. They heard them all in the Divine Voice
2. They heard only the first two: ‚ÄúI am the lord thy God‚Äù, and ‚Äúthou shalt have no other gods before me‚Äù, before being overwhelmed. The rest had to be received through Moses. 
3. They heard only aleph (◊ê), with which the first commandment begins, the first letter of anochi (◊ê◊†◊ï◊õ◊ô), and silent without a patach, merely commanding the mouth to open. ‚ÄúRabbi Mendel Torum transforms the revelation on Mount Sinai into a mystical revelation, pregnant with infinite meaning, but devoid of any specific one.‚Äù


Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro
===
rating: yes
posted: August 30, 2021
cover: /assets/book-covers/never-let-me-go.jpg

I really liked it. Author does a great job conveying little nuances of relationships. I feel similarly about past life and previous relationships that could have gone so differently. 

At any rate it‚Äôs great writing and vivid character development. The love triangle is extremely strong. But the world building is pretty weak. How can the world of the "students" and the world of the rest of the population be so hermetic? They have full freedom to go anywhere, yet there is no interaction. On this topic, I find myself actively suspending disbelief.

As a teacher, I guess there are three possible scenarios:

1. Hide the truth from clones, raise them like wolves, harvest their organs. (Ground truth universe)
2. Hide the truth from clone-students, give them a decent human childhood, harvest their organs. (Hailsham's approach)
3. Tell students the whole story which would deprive them of their childhood, but give them a chance to potentially empower them to change the system somehow. (Lucy's approach)

I kept waiting for Tommy to attempt to change the system during his fourth donation. Ishiguro does some nice false foreshadowing, and when Tommy caves without a fight, the effect is one of resignation.

Systemic change is hard to achieve.

Everyone is born into some station and feels like they must do what it is they are born to do, rarely questioning or acting on their impulses. Tommy's river analogy comes to mind. People drift down this river of least resistance without much agency. If you were born as a student-clone, what would you do? Very likely, live the life allotted to you, in the best case that of a Hailsham student.

# We are in Hailsham

The fact that the students can't have children of their own is the tragic part of this whole piece. In their lives, as in ours, death is guaranteed. In theirs, it becomes inevitable after the fourth donation, in ours after age 80 or 90. But the finality of death without children is such that all is lost. This is not really a well-developed theme in the book, more of a background take. Kathy makes it explicitly through the song.

I thought that Kazuo Ishiguro invented "Never Let Me Go" the song, and but it turns out that [the song is real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UX6tzE7P44), the cover is real, and Judy Bridgewater is real. Honestly, this is disappointing. Previously, I wrote:

> Nice use of the invented song, and vividly described. It serves as a really touching tearjerker.

I found the ending to be a little bit drawn out. For example I thought that the book would end at the scene where Tommy and Kathy go and talk to Madame. A lot of the stuff after that was a little bit less clear and might have just been possible to cut.


Gardener & Carpenter by Alison Gopnik
===
rating: yes
posted: August 25, 2021
cover: /assets/book-covers/gardener-and-carpenter.jpg

This one's been on my radar for years. I've read a lot of the author's articles and generally feel a strong affinity for Isaiah Berlin, whom Gopnik has done quite a bit to popularize. Self described as a Bubbie from Berkeley with a PhD in developmental neuroscience that sometimes dabbles in philosophy. 

# Core idea

The message promulgated in most parenting books is that raising kids is like carpentry: consider what material your dealing with, form a well specified blueprint, measure twice, cut once. Then you can judge how well you‚Äôve done by the final result. 

A parent‚Äôs goal should instead be to raise their child like resilient garden that can adapt to a dynamic world. Such a garden or maybe even wild meadow evolves and adapts to circumstances. This is in contrast to a much more static approach of growing hot house tomatoes. The hot house is highly regulated and creates ideal circumstances for the tomato to grow. But these ideal circumstances are not reflective of the real world. Hot house tomato‚Äôs are not resilient. 

Reminds me a bit of legibility and [[Seeing Like a State by James Scott]] but applied to children. Authoritarian High modern failure mode in kids is one that tries to carpenter too much. I have examples of this in distant friends: MA rebelled against becoming a doctor, IN rebelled against becoming a software engineer. Both results were disappointing to their parents. Better to not be so prescriptive.

(Does this idea of parent-gardener break down if you consider a very large garden? I guess if garden is large enough you end up with parent-industrial farmer. Is that what school is then?)


# Against parentING

I appreciated the more philosophical bent, especially as compared to other parenting books. But the narrative sometimes bent towards a pedantic but still an insightful critique of ‚Äúparenting‚Äù especially as a goal driven activity. You don‚Äôt go around ‚Äúfriending‚Äù people, offspring are never ‚Äúchilding‚Äù you and your spouse is not usually ‚Äúwifing‚Äù you. Gerunds have their place though. 

Other relationships offer an interesting parallel: you don‚Äôt think you are a successful friend if they have become successful. Nor do you become a successful husband by profoundly improving your wife.

Many observations framed as paradoxes. Sounds more like tensions to me. Tensions between:

- **Formal education and play**, which itself leads to education but in roundabout illegible ways. (Makes me think of my work and when I‚Äôm happiest. It‚Äôs when I‚Äôm playing. Building toys. Playing to learn. 
- **Explore vs exploit**. Since childhood kids want to be independent but also seek out the comfort of their parents. The same is true over a lifecycle, going from profound dependence to the opposite extreme. Similar tensions around Tradition and innovation. More on this in [[Explore vs exploit trade-offs]].

Fundamentally, [[Open-endedness is required to solve ambitious problems]]. Play and childhood are optimized for this.


# Recent changes parents and society

Historically, humans live grown in large, multigenerational families. Most have the opportunity to help raise siblings Or cousins before becoming parents. Once parents, their kids are raised in large party but extended family. 

Families growing smaller. More mobility. Having kids later in line after more education. Many new parents don‚Äôt have any expertise with kids at all. 

‚ÄúParenting‚Äù builds on this gap in knowledge and caregivers. It‚Äôs profits from the expectation of educated people that things are learned through books. 

# Analogy to dieting 

Referencing Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan. What was formerly a traditional way of being, like cooking meals from a certain cuisine, was replaced by a sort of science-inspired explosion of dieting advice. The more we deliberately cook and eat to become healthy, the less healthy we become.

The more we raise children to make them happy and successful adults the less happy and successful they become. [[Trying not to try]]

The sheer quantity of parenting and dieting books itself is just an indication that none of them work. If one did, they‚Äôd all be out of business. This critique reminds me of the one in [[Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization]]. 

# Generational compounding

If a child is slightly better at using a tool, this advantage is slightly conferred to their offspring. And the effect compounds. Children's brains are the largest of all animals and our childhoods are the longest. Largely this is to have more time to develop and grow a brain, which is extremely plastic so that it can adapt maximally to its cultural milieu. 

Birds are categorized as either precocial or altricial, depending on their capabilities at birth.

1. **Precocious birds** are capable of moving around on its own soon after hatching. They develop early and are pretty dumb. Examples: chickens, geese, and turkeys.
2. **Altricial birds** are basically useless at birth. They hatch with eyes closed, fully depend on the parent, and cannot even leave the nest on their own. Examples: crows, herons, owls, and woodpeckers.

> ‚ÄúOur minds can change rapidly‚Ä¶ in just a few generations!‚Äù

# Evolution: why do women live past menopause?

Most mammals die before they reach menopause.

Gopnik, a grandma herself, produces a strong argument in defense of grandmas. Post-menopausal grandmothers are evolutionarily advantageous because they allow their children to have more offspring despite the high maintenance and long childhood of each grandchild. By providing more childcare, the grandmother helps scale her genetic impact.

> We don‚Äôt care about children because we love them. We love them because we care for them. 

It's a reinforcing feedback loop.

I'm intrigued by this idea of [[Catholic Age of Reason is 7]]. Clearly the long childhood has become much longer in recent generations.

# Maybe against evo psych?

Gopnik presents a convincing critique of evolutionary psychology. So much of being a human is embedded in our culture that it‚Äôs unclear that insights from the Pleistocene are applicable without lots of caveats. She also draws on the vast variety of behaviors exhibited by other primates. Gorillas are very aggressive and organize in harems, bonobos are very promiscuous and enjoy free love.

But then almost in the same breath, she proceeds to refer to a lot of evolutionary psychological studies, such as an interesting explanation of why post-menopausal women make sense from an evolutionary perspective.

# In favor of apprenticeships

More evo-psych studies in which Gopnik makes an ultimate argument against schooling and in favor of the traditional master-apprentice model. There's a bunch of social psychology studies and half of them sound a little bit dubious. It's also often unclear how they relate to the thesis the book.

Young children naturally imitate adults, under certain conditions: that the adult seems to be confident, that they have a good track record of success, that the adult is not a robot, etc.

Kids also over-imitate, which is to say they will repeat additional actions of the adult even if they appear to be superfluous. Does this natural inclination of over-imitation explain rites that carry over almost verbatim l'dor v'dor? TRADITION!!

And so, argues Gopnik, imitation based learning is a super good foundation for the master-apprentice model. Lots of critiques of school a la [[Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich]]. There's also the historical argument, that the master-apprentice model is how people have learned for a long time.

Grad students are often professor apprentices, learning to write and getting critiqued.

> ‚ÄúFor most of our history, children have started their internships at age 7, not 27‚Äù

## Good argumentation techniques

Gopnik describes a thought experiment in which baseball is taught as if it were part of the core school curriculum. Students would begin with history of the game, introduction to running, then dive deeply into ball and bat construction, and those that get accepted into a Masters in Baseball might get to play some softball in the last few months of their degree.

Great (apocryphal) story about the master swordsman who forced his pupil to cook his food. But would show up randomly in the kitchen and smack his apprentice with a wooden sword. After three years of this the apprentice became always vigilant. Full legend is [[The Taste of Banzo's Sword]]

Effective passage on "the device", which is reads like a Tristan Harris-style attack on smartphones, social media, or insert_bogeyman_here. She then reveals that it's actually about books, which were similar criticized by Socrates. This is a good reminder about generational conservatism, and made me feel more inclined to pursue far future technology with questionable social implications.

> The day before you were born always looks like Eden, and the day after your children were born always looks like Mad Max.


# Play is fundamental

Interesting that children seem to seek out evidence that contradicts their theories as part of play. 

Play must be spontaneous. The [[Ms. Havisham Problem illustrates that play must be spontaneous]] is a good framing of why, citing Dickens' book where a disgruntled old lady asks a child to play for her entertainment. 

> "I am tired," said Miss Havisham. "I want diversion, and I have done with men and women. Play." I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.

Play must be spontaneous and is demonstrably more effective than teaching in some cases. Gopnik cites a study where children were either 1) shown how a multifunctional toy works, or 2) allowed to discover the functionality for themselves. Children shown how to play with a toy did not tend to discover other novel ways of playing with it while those that were allowed to explore ended up discovering more functionality. (Surely this depends on how much functionality was demonstrated in 1).

(Gopnik does not explicitly say this but I really like the idea that [[Play is deliberate practice for wicked problems]])

## Why is play fun? 

Why is sex fun? Evolution made sex fun so that people and animals would do it and propagate our genes.

Why is play fun? Evolution made play fun so that people and animals would learn how to world works experientially. (All of this flies in the face of the earlier critique of evopsych?)


# A grab bag of ideas

The books flows reasonably well, but some pieces feel more like a side show than a coherent part of the gardener vs carpenter thesis.

Gopnik makes a bunch of observations like this:

- A study shows correlation between standardized testing and ADHD diagnosis. I guess this is vaguely a result of excessive carpentry?
- Puberty apparently happens at a younger age today than historically? Super weird hypotheses, including Artificial light and Sedentary lifestyle.
- Points to increases in absolute intelligence over time (IQ scores are set so that 100 is the average). This is the Flynn effect. Gopnik speculates that increasing IQ is in tension with finely honed and focused expertise.

# My critique: consider ergodicity

Most gardens have hundreds of plants growing in them. But your average kinder garden only has 2.5 kinders, and every parent wants to do everything in their power to help them thrive. Even in a garden with hundreds of plants, it's hard to really understand what works and what doesn't. With an N of O(1), you certainly don't want to experiment and risk failure. So people take the safe path, another example of [[Cover Your Ass]].

This is my fundamental criticism of the Gardener model of parenting. In other words, I am identifying the core challenge to the parent. If Gopnik is indeed right, and the gardener model is the one to adopt, it is difficult for ambitious parents to do this in practice, because they are so invested in their child's future and be subject to competitive parenting, etc.


Late Middle Ages

An excellent ending to a worthwhile trilogy on Medieval History. Also see [Early
Middle Ages](/books/early-middle-ages) and [High Middle
Ages](/books/high-middle-ages).

# Franks and Popes

The papacy was not doing so hot in the late middle ages. Cardinals routinely failed to agree in the next pope. In one incident, a famous hermit criticized them harshly for being so petty and squabbling. In response the cardinals decided to appoint him as pope Celestine V. He held the position reluctantly and then decreed in a papal bull that popes can resign, and promptly did so. His power hungry successor Boniface VIII imprisoned him to prevent his potential return, and Celestine V died in prison.

Phillip the Fair (Phillip IV), king of France around the 13th century, had a falling out with the pope reminiscent of the Teutonic rulers of prior centuries. The difference here is rather than succumbing to papal power he thwarted it successfully so that future popes knew not to mess with French kings. After threatening to excommunicate Philip IV and issuing a papal bull suggesting explicitly that popes trumped kings, Philip IV's royal troops captured Pope Boniface VIII, imprisoned him, beat him badly. The Boniface VIII died a month later and his successor Clement V was pressured to move the papacy to France.

Crusaders that remained in the holy lands after the crusades formed Crusader States. One such order, The Knights Templar defended Christian Jerusalem from Arab reconquest. They were monk-knights who helped other crusaders. The Knights Templar grew rich from donations from Christians who wanted to keep the holy city in their grasp. They grew unpopular after losing Jerusalem to Saladin and amassing great wealth. 

Phil IV decided to pursue the Templar order, prosecution was also likely a money grab. He also expelled the Jews and annexed their property. [[Expelling Jews is historically a great way for kings to get rich quick]]. The pope initially condemned the mass Templar arrest but then when they confessed under torture, the pope called for other European kings to also arrest their Templars under papal authority. Papal palaces we‚Äôre built in Avignon. Subsequent popes were selected from the population of southern France. 

## Papal Schism

Meanwhile, pressure mounted for the Papacy to return to Rome. Popes were the spiritual successors of St. Paul, bishop of Rome. If they weren't in Rome that legacy was undermined. Urban VI was then selected under pressure from Roman citizens who rioted in demand of an Italian pope. The cardinals presented the masses with a pope of Italian origin but years later the French cardinals reneged and appointed another pope, Clement VII. He ruled in Avignon. As a result, there were two active popes at this time, and this period is referred to as the Western Schism aka Papal Schism (not to be confused with the East-West Schism aka Great Schism). 

France and it‚Äôs allies like Scotland were generally in favor of the pope in Avignon. But sometimes there was a split in a single city and there were two bishops, each loyal to the French and Italian pope respectively. 

It was thought that once one of the popes died, the population would support the other and the schism would end. But when urban VI died, his followers appointed another successor in Rome. And then when Clement VII died, his followers appointed a new pope in Avignon. 

## Conciliarism reform movement

In response to this shitshow, the Conciliarism reform movement began. A high level church councils composed of bishops and other Catholic leaders met and passed judgement apart from, or potentially against, the pope. The council of Pisa in 1408 was organized by a few breakout bishops from both French and Italian sides. They hoped to appoint a new pope and depose the two existing ones. The appointed pope died a year later and was replaced by John XXIII, who was odious and widely hated. So now there were three popes.

The council at Constance succeeded in deposing John 23 for moral reasons. The pope in Rome was also convinced to step down. The council finally deposed the pope in France. The papal schism finally ended in 1407 when the Cardinals elected Martin V. 

What followed was a disagreement between those in favor of church councils and those in favor of the old system. Subsequent councils were not well attended, little reason to do so since the schism had ended. Still council at Basel imposed a bunch of limitations on the church. They made a limit of 24 cardinals, no more than 8 from each country, and constrained the amount of money the papacy could collect from local churches.

(My synthesis of this is that overall, these turbulent times paved the way for the protestant reformation.)

# Hundred Years War

The hundred year war was a long conflict, not a constant total war, but a series of skirmishes. Britain decisively won the important battles early on. (Lots of overlap with [[The Story of Medieval England]]). Joan of Arc had a decisive part to play, just when France was all but defeated and almost entirely under British control managed to incite a last ditch effort to reconquer. 

One of the most violent years during the war was one in which there was no fighting between sides after the treaty of Br√©tigny in 1360. Mercenary armies hired by the warring kings began indiscriminately pillage for want of supplies. The result was chaos, death, and destruction. To remedy this failure mode, salaried standing armies were introduced around 1450. This was expensive but cheaper than the alternative. It also greatly strengthened royal power compared to that of the nobles since now the crown could rely more on a paid army rather than the decentralized feudal system or lords and vassals. 
This was the first Christian standing army since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

## Critical invention: The Longbow

The English first encountered the longbow in their wars with the Welsh. English Longbows emerged by the 100 years war contributed to their prowess against the French who relied heavily on knights. The original short bow didn't require much training to use, but packed almost no punch against a knight. Crossbows were then invented as an effective ranged weapon against knights but suffered from a slow firing rate. You could speed it up a bit by lying prone but doing this in the face of a charging knight was not prudent. 

The Longbow took the best of both worlds: the force of its blow could penetrate armor and it didn't take ages to reload. This weapon gave the English their decisive victories against the French knight armies at Cr√©cy, Poitiers and Agincourt. 

The longbow wielded by hundreds of archers was a very effective way to deal with knights. And although unlike short bows, it requires training, fighting as a longbowman was far cheaper and easier than fighting as a knight. Now the peasant class had once again a reason to fight, and gain some leverage over the noble fighting classes.

The Hundred Years War and ‚ÄúBabylonian captivity‚Äù of the church in France occurred simultaneously, as did the Black Death. 

# The Black Death

Likely Bubonic Plague. 1347-1351 was period of greatest mortality.  Killed potentially 50% of people in Europe at the time. It came from the east via Italy, the main connection point to the Orient. Earlier and more southerly parts of Europe were the most affected, in some cases 75% of the population dying.

There wasn't a good understanding about the underlying reason for the plague at all, so other reasons were sought. As usual, Jews were blamed for the plague, leading to increased pogroms around this same era. 

Around 1340 was a local maximum in European population. These levels were not seen again until the 17th century. Outbreaks of the plague still occurred, but became rarer and rarer. 

![[Population of Europe 1300-1800.png]]

Because of the huge depopulation, things looked quite different economically. Suddenly there was a labor shortage. Wages shot up 3-5x. Cost of food had decreased due to a reduction in demand. Land prices went down too. Wage laborers began to enjoy a very high standard of living. 

Economically speaking, this was great news for the surviving poor, but bad news for the nobles. A variety of attempts were made by nobles to curtail these negative economic effects. Some tried to fix wages by law, which largely failed to overpower strong market forces. Others tried to bring back serfdom, effectively bringing back free labor. This was counter to the interests of the crown since serfs were in the jurisdiction of their lord, including for tax and legal reasons. This was resisted in the west, but for some reason in the east of Europe serfdom came back with a vengeance and lasted well into the 19th century, with second order effects into modernity. 

# Freedom in East and West Europe

In the early Middle Ages, Eastern Europe was the European frontier. Lords of the east could entice western serfs to move and settle in their domains in exchange for freedom. Thus early in the Middle Ages, the east had more free smallholders than the west. 

After the plague, the dynamics shifted substantially. Western countries with historically stronger kings were not interested in supporting serfs, who would only strengthen nobles, paying tax to them and being subject to their courts. 

Also, empowered peasantry in the west staged successful rebellions (The Jacquerie in France, English Peasant Revolt) against nobles that attempted to revive serfdom. England was especially ahead of the game in terms of personal liberties for the masses. After the Normal conquest, William the Conqueror and his line established unprecedentedly strong and centralized control over England. The Baronial revolts and early Magna Carta set the stage for more personal liberties, and a rule of law. The island had time to develop independently due to its distance from mainland Europe.

In the east however, a feudal, more distributed system controlled by nobles and weaker rulers meant that serfdom could be brought back in force. Toward the late Middle Ages, many peasants in the east were newly serfs, and very few in the west. Russian serfdom lasted well into the mid 19th century. 

Feudalism is distributed and leads to bad outcomes for the masses. In general this is a good example of distributed not being always better than centralized from a consequential standpoint. 


# Gone are the days of the knights

## Pikes
 
Infantry was becoming increasingly effective against knights around the 13th century. In Flanders, a knight army could be thwarted by to opening up water gates and flooding the whole plain. In the Scottish mountains, knights did not have a flat area from which to charge. More generally, effective anti-knight tactics were developed around this time:

- **Traps**: Infantry would dig ditches, fill them with spikes and cover them with leaves. 
- **Pikemen**: pikes were longer than lances, so would impale a knight before they would impale the pikeman. Armies of pikemen would dig their pike's dull ends into the ground.
- **Halberds**: The Swiss developed the halberd, a spear with an axe and hook. You could use it as a pike, and/or use the hook to pull the knight off his horse, and/or split him in twain with the axe. It‚Äôs sort of a Swiss Army knife, so to speak. The halberd could also be used offensively in phalanx-like formations.

## Cannons

Gunpowder was developed initially in China, where it was used as a shock weapon. Early European cannons were also useful only for shock tactics as well, being very loud and scary to those that heard it in the battlefield. But they were not at all effective at hitting their targets, and accidents often resulted in the death of the canon crew. Still, the Europeans were more persistent and continuously refined the cannon to eventually make a very effective siege weapon.

The development of the canon with especially devastating for knights and other lords since it meant that their castle at home was no longer as impregnable.

Each cannon was initially given a name, much like Trebuchets, one named Malvoisin ("bad neighbor"). It's interesting what war equipment is given names, and which is not. Trebuchets, early Cannons. Ships are always named. Why aren't planes? What about tanks?

At the start of the hundred years war, cannonballs were made out of large stone boulders. These were rounded out by hand, and inevitably ended up with irregularities which would greatly reduce accuracy. Even if the stone cannonball hit the wall, it would shatter on impact. Around 1430, stone cannonballs were replaced with cast iron cannonballs which were much more spherical and much  more devastating on impact.

Castle design reacted to the invention of cannon. Walls became lower and thicker. Square towers rounded out and became cylindrical. Towers became the same height as walls, to allow artillery on the walls to more easily move into position. 


## Arquebusiers and musketeers

Personal firearms were less effective than cannons during the middle ages. The earliest resembled broomsticks with a small cannon on the end. The arquebus was developed in the early 15th century and it was a functional precursor to the musket. This weapon proved effective against knights at the Battle of Pavia, just like the longbow at Agincourt. 

The combination of pikemen and musketeers was an especially formidable force against knights. Knights really hated Musketeers especially (nice backstory on the whole Three Musketeers plot). Even heavier plate mail was developed to try to defend against musket balls. Some inroads were made, but ultimately these full-plate suits were so heavy that they were impractical. 

---

As a result of so many forces working against nobles, many are forced to take paid employment, either at the court of a more powerful noble or at the court of the king. This marks the rise of courtiers. This cultural shift replaces the ideal of the chivalric knight. Now, nobles are expected not to ride a horse and save ladies, but to be nonchalant royal advisors capable of performing music and reciting poetry. Presumably all while still fulfilling duties of their job for which they were hired?

# Printing press and related inventions

Although the printing press is by far the sexiest invention required for broader production of printed books, other breakthroughs were required in writing materials, advances in script, and book style. Daileader does a good job emphasizing this.

## Papyrus-parchment-paper

Papyrus was the earliest writing material, made of a water plant that grows in abundance in the Nile river delta in Egypt. It emerged around 3000 BCE and the Egyptians controlled it fully. 

Parchment is another writing material made of animal skins. It may have emerged as early as 1500 BCE, but is named after the King of Pergamum (–ø–µ—Ä–≥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç) in Asia Minor around 100 BCE. It was developed in response to the cessation of Egyptian papyrus exports. The process was of making parchment was quite intense, requiring animal skins to be stretched over a frame, cleaned fully of fat, then dried. The rougher exterior side¬†of the skin could serve as a book cover. The whiter interior was used to write on. 

Parchment was expensive to produce, and as a result was often reused. Old scrolls would just be cleaned up, with ink removed, and then use it again to create anew. Vellum was a fancier, whiter variant of parchment. The highest grade required killing a pregnant sheep and her unborn calf, and then creating the parchment from the calf's skin (aka Chickenskin).

Towards the late middle ages, paper production was imported from China. This was much cheaper than parchment and the necessary condition for democratizing books.

## Advances in script

[[Carolingian minuscule]] was commonly used around the time of the early middle ages. One problem with this script was that it was quite rounded and laborious for scribes to produce by hand. So scribes created a more efficient writing style called now called Gothic script. This had the benefit of being mostly vertical, so easieir to write because of a predominantly unidirectional motion of the arm. An added benefit was that the script was more compact, so more text would fit on one page.

Simultaneously, handwritten script with ligatures was revived from classical antiquity. Later, in an attempt to disavow of anything middle age related, scholars shunned gothic script and reverted back to minuscule, not realizing that it too was a middle age invention (c. 9th century)

## Book style

During the early Middle Ages books were extremely large and heavy, requiring a pedestal to support. Books tended to get smaller over time, some were soon small enough to fit into a pocket. 

Further inventions in readability were introduced: indices, tables of contents.

## Printing press precursors

Woodcut prints allowed the artist to create multiple copies of his artwork. This required more effort than simply sketching with ink and paper, since the work needed to be etched into wood. But then once the wooden etching was created, you could create hundreds or thousands of impressions. The problem with wood was that it wore out overtime. Handcrafted metal blocks were also attempted, and this was obviously even harder than making a wood block.

Another challenge with wood blocks was that the stamped image would sometimes be unevenly produced, either because part of the wooden block had deteriorated, or there was some uneven application of ink, or uneven pressure. Furthermore, doing two-sided prints of woodblocks was impossible using this technique, since producing the imprint on one side would create an extrusion on the other side.

## The printing press

Gutenberg's printing press combined two prior inventions: the wine press for evenly transferring ink from source to target, and movable metal type. A printer would typeset a whole page, make many copies of it, then move on to the next page. The end result were many copies of a printed book.

Metal typesetting was known in Asia, but never combined with wine style presses. Compared to Asia, Europe had other important advantages: 

- European alphabets are phonetic and have fewer than 30 symbols. In contrast, Asian alphabets are mostly ideographical and have thousands of symbols. 
- Chinese printing presses were state run, and as a result mostly Confucian classics were produced. In Europe the printing press was subject to the free market, and thrived.

Second order impacts of the printing press were huge:

1. Spread of knowledge in general. Nuff said!
2. Errata could be issued in bulk, since many books were now identical and issued in editions. 
3. Ossification of English spelling. Previously spelling was pretty variable. This is especially annoying since the great vowel shift followed shortly thereafter, rendering English spellings nonsensical. 


# Humanism in Late Medieval Europe

The humanist movement arose in 14th century Italy as part of the Italian Renaissance. Humanists aimed for a revival of classical art and literature, and following Petrarch, viewed the preceding centuries as a dark and lost age of regression. (Interesting to see how the ‚Äúfirst industrial revolution‚Äù from [[Medieval Technology and Social Change]] framing conflicts with this). They were headquartered largely in Florence where the recently founded university had not yet been fully oriented toward the scholastic tradition which was ubiquitous everywhere else. Florence at the time was extremely rich, minting the Florin, the first gold coin Europe had seen in almost a millennium.

Unlike medieval artists and authors, humanists signed their work and strive for a sort of secular immortality by living on in the minds of their peers after their inevitable death. That said, humanists were still deeply entrenched in the Christian tradition. This was not yet the enlightenment, nor the reformation, nor the scientific revolution.


# Christians and Muslim conflicts in¬†the late middle ages

The Byzantine empire stood valiantly for a millennium longer than its western roman counterpart. Its land holdings empire ebbed and flowed from assailants from all around, sometimes shrinking to little more than Constantinople itself. By the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks finally conquered the impregnable city of Constantinople and officially ended the Byzantine empire. 

This was seen as a huge loss, especially from a humanist lens. The whole Greek trove of knowledge was lost to Christendom for eternity! In practice, by then much of this trove of classical Greek culture had been assimilated by the west, through translation, and through a revival of Greek language, hearkening back to classical antiquity, when Roman elites were fluent in both Latin and Greek.

With the fall of the Byzantine empire, Europe was bracing for more incursions from their aggressive and powerful Turkish neighbors. Sure enough, the Ottomans even managed to conquer and briefly hold small parts of Italy. So it was welcome news that in Iberia, the kingdoms of Aragon and Castille had formed an alliance with the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, and they had set out to conquer Granada, the last Islamic state in the west. This was a culmination of many centuries of European reconquest of Al-Andalus, the Ummayad kingdom that formed from the ashes of the Visigoths, defeated in the 8th century. Spain was once a cultural melange of three religions, but F&I were keen to homogenize their joint kingdom. 

# The Spanish Inquisition

Shortly after the defeat of Granada, jubilant Ferdinand and Isabella decided to kick it up a notch and the Spanish Inquisition swung into full force. Spain had previously not participated in the papal inquisition, and unlike the previous inquisitions which relied on inquisitors reporting to the pope, the Spanish inquisition was operated by the king and queen. 

It's somewhat unclear why F&I decided to force all Jews to convert or leave. Ferdinand had recently appointed Jewish courtiers whose contract was not due to expire for years. The reason given was that there were too many Christians converting to Judaism in Spain. In practice, anti-Jewish sentiment had been rising for decades, thanks to preachers like Ferrand Martinez, and the massacre in 1391 which led to 50,000 Jewish deaths and far more forced conversions.

In 1492, every Jew in Spain was given a choice: convert or leave. Those that converted to Christianity were called conversos. Some conversos even managed to secure bishoprics, but many were treated with suspicion by the masses, who suspected that many conversos continued to practice the Jewish faith in secret. Thus even if you converted from Judaism, you were still somehow Jewish, and this is the origin of Jewishness as a race, which permeates into modernity and foreshadows Jewish horrors of the 20th century. Furthermore, now that conversos were Christian, they were subject to the inquisition, and those that were found guilty of heresy were burnt alive.

# Maritime technology in Iberia

Back to technology: navigation and sailing ships, in the context of Iberian expansion and the age of exploration. The Iberian peninsula at the time was not split between Spain and Portugal, but between several rival kingdoms: Kingdom of Castile, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Navarre, and the Kingdom of Portugal.

## The Caravel

Shipbuilding technology was fairly stagnant until the 15th century. Here are a few common ship types before this period:

- **Longships**, aka galleys were powered by teams of rowers. They had to be light so that the men could propel it and it had to be long enough so enough men could fit inside. Because of the large crew, their provisions, and other constraints, these ships could not carry much cargo. Longships were short range and only used on the Mediterranean. Some longships had sails that would be raised in favorable downwinding conditions.
- **Roundships** often had a single mast with a square rigged single sail. They were large and bulky and slow, but could carry a lot of cargo. The square rigged sail meant you would mainly use the sail to go downwind, greatly limiting maneuverability. 
- **Lateen** sailboats originated in the Nile, but were later used in the Mediterranean. These triangular sails could luff and generate lift using the sail as a wing, and move the vessel towards the wind. Lateen sails of the 14th century also tended to be quite small, so were not very effective.

Because of its geography, the Iberian kingdoms had exposure to both north Atlantic roundships, and ships with Lateen sails commonly used in the Mediterranean. The Caravel, invented by the Portuguese in the 15th century, combined both types of sails. Early designs had a front square rigged sail, and a rear lateen sail, allowing ships to zig-zag upwind, or run downwind depending on wind conditions.

## Other Iberian advantages

The Iberian peninsula was extremely well situated geographically, in the far southwest of Europe, and thus the natural portal to west Africa. Furthermore, the Spanish had a great history of seafaring already and were notoriously brave sailors, willing to venture further than others in pursuit of fish and whales. Lastly, some of the best mapmakers of the age were based on the Balearic islands (Ibiza, Mallorca, Menorca).

The Kingdom of Portugal had the early upper hand. Portuguese Caravels were slowly traveling further and further south down the West African coast. Thanks to the funding efforts of Prince Henry the navigator, Vasco da Gamma finally reached the Cape of Good Hope. Meanwhile, F&I were spending most of their disposable income on conquering Granada for the new Spanish alliance. 

Portugal established footholds in many parts strategically located in Africa and far beyond. Distant ports included Goa off the coast of India, Macao off China, many of which remain to this day Portuguese territories. F&I had attempted to loosen the Portuguese monopoly on the world, they were ultimately unsuccessful and in 1480 Ferdinand and Isabella granted a official monopoly to Portugal over a train with west Africa. Portuguese caravels were militarily superior and were very quickly able to destroy Arab fleets that previously controlled trade in the Indian ocean. The Portuguese king assumed a lofty title: Lord of the conquest and navigation of the ocean in India, Arabia, and Persia. 

The Canary Islands were a bit of a revelation for Europeans that discovered them a new world that wasn't yet known to them, yet populated by people! Castilians first conquered the island and enslaved the local Guanches, the indigenous people of the islands. They died in huge quantities from the diseases the Europeans brought with them. Instead, the Spanish had to rely on imported west African slaves to run the plantations there. Why weren't west Africans subject to European diseases? Mainly because the cross-pollination between Europe and Africa. The European treatment of the Canaries established the model for colonization and served as a base for Columbus to venture further west. 

Madeira and the Azores were uninhabited and discovered shortly after the Canaries. West African slaves were quickly imported there to establish the Sugar plantations as well as the Portuguese Madeira industry.

# The Columbian exchange

Columbus had failed to convince the Portuguese king to fund his voyage, so pursued funding from Ferdinand and Isabella. The Catholic Monarchs were busy vanquishing the last remnants of Granada, it was taking longer than expected, and cost a fortune. They kept him on retainer for seven years, and only then committed to Columbus' voyage. Once he discovered what he called Asia but what was actually the New World, it was unclear who would own the territory. 

Prior to the European discovery of America, The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the newly-discovered lands outside Europe between the Portuguese Empire and the Spanish Empire (Crown of Castile), along an arbitrary meridian set by the Pope. This line happened to miss North America but cut South America in half, and explains why Brazil became a Portuguese territory (!).

One way to look at Columbus' discovery is as a large ecological event, in which previously diversifying and independent ecosystems  suddenly merged. If this is not the start of the Anthropocene, what is?

## Euro-American trade imbalances

**Plants**: a pretty good balance trade balance. Many critical crops from the New World corn and potato proved to be extremely important back in Europe. Other delicious new world plants included tomatoes, pineapples, peanuts, kidney beans, cashews, squash, sweet potatoes, avocado, chili pepper. And also druuuugs like coca and tobacco. And don't forget hammocks!

Meanwhile, the New World saw a lot of new and critical crops from the east: sugar cane, bananas, coffee, wine grapes. Also onions, radish, and dandelions.

**Diseases**: a big imbalance in favor of Europe. America had syphilis, and that's pretty much it. But the old world had loads of new diseases for the Americans, decimating their population. 

**Animals** a big imbalance in favor of Europe. America had very few pack animals: no cattle, pigs, sheep, or horses. Americans mainly had Turkeys and Llamas.


# End of Middle Ages

Scholars can‚Äôt decide if 14th and 15th centuries are Middle Ages or renaissance. If you go to Italy at this period it‚Äôs the renaissance, otherwise it's the Middle Ages. One way to think about where to draw the line is what sort of things one could expect in the middle ages. Here are a few:

## Characteristics of the Middle Ages

- Hereditary kings.
- Elites are nobles, basis in landowning and military dominance.
- Small scale production in the home, commerce dominated by guilds designed to keep production low.
- Bottom of society are serfs, liberties constrained.
- Belief in god is universal, and the basis of all intellectual life. 
- Reverence for the past and skepticism for thinking from first principles.

Based on this list, the Middle Ages continues well into the 16th century. Italian Humanists were trying to make a break from the past, but did nothing to eliminate nobility or serfdom, improve quality of life, or reform the guild system. 

Daileader proposes a better potential endpoints to the Middle Ages, like the Scientific Revolution or the Protestant Reformation. But even these periods were rooted in the Middle Ages. Luther was a scholastic scholar following Aquinas' tradition. Newton was deeply religious. Perhaps an even better endpoint for the Middle Ages actually is the Enlightenment in the mid-18th century. The French Revolution was the antithesis to the Middle Ages and ushered in the drastic and abrupt end to many of the institutions central to the Middle Ages. (That said, the lecturer is a professor of Middle Age History, and is biased towards stretching the start and endpoints of his period of study.)


Medieval Technology and Social Change

cover: /assets/book-covers/medieval-technology.jpg

I'm clearly on a serious history of the Middle Ages kick. I found this book by just searching the internet inspired by earlier courses on Medieval history, and didn't really know what I was getting into. Apparently it's really famous and influential among Medieval scholars, even causing the [Great Stirrup Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stirrup_Controversy).

This book was clearly written for academics. Latin and French quotes remain
untranslated, even in footnotes and endnotes. Yet somehow despite this, it is
engaging and readable.

It's great fun to try to integrate viewpoints on the same topic (Middle Age
Technology) and begin to start to fill in the gaps. One great benefit of
focusing on the Middle Ages is that there wasn't as much technology to speak of.
This helps focus in on fewer things, and constraints are good.

# History of Horses in Combat

1. Horse chariots, in which a two wheeled cart is used as a moving platform for combat.
2. Mounted archers and light combat on horseback.
3. Knights, using combined weight of horse, rider and armor.

# Charles and the Knights

Charles Martel and his descendants saw the potential of using horses for mounted shock combat. (White seems to ignore high backed saddles and the couched lance technique, with a shocking emphasis on stirrups.) Using armies of knights, Martel the Hammer defeated the Arabs and retook many lands, rebuilding a shorter lived spiritual successor to the Roman empire. With knights proving so effective, there was a need for more knights. This led to a vast proliferation of feudalism, enabling new upwardly mobile vassals to gain access to lands required of a knight, and ultimately cemented this new style of warfare. By 1000, the Latin "miles", which had meant soldier, began to mean knight. 

White has a great discussion about the ‚Äúdiffusion‚Äù of stirrups. In general this lens of [[Diffusion of Technology]] is one to keep in mind. I've adopted it in my random walk into [[Age Heaping Using Canadian 1852 Census data]]. As White eloquently puts it,

> As our understanding of technology increases, it becomes clear that a new device merely opens a door; it does not compel one to enter. The acceptance or rejection of an invention, or the extent to which its implications are realized if it is accepted depends quite as much upon the condition of a society, and upon the imagination of its leaders, as upon the nature of the technological item itself.

The [[Second order effects and unintended consequences]] of this shift were massive. Horses were expensive to buy and maintain, armor was becoming heavier to be effective against lances with the force of thousands of pounds at its tip. Equipment for one knight seemed to cost about 20 oxen (a peasant family relied on 2). Knights often had squires, and multiple spare horses.

Charlemagne and other Carolingian kings encouraged peasants to band together and choose one of them to fight as a knight. Since land was the source of power of the time (money was not as key), the landed knights became the nouveau riche, creating a large gulf between them and the peasantry from which many of them came.

The old Germanic (nit: wasn't it the case in Rome too?) idea that every freeman was a soldier was now replaced by a professional fighting class.

Because of all the armor, knights became virtually unrecognizable and needed to develop some visual identification, and thus tradition of heraldry was born.

The cross bow emerged, either revived, or borrowed from the Chinese to penetrate knight's armor.


# Farming Practices

Cross plowing was a technique to till tougher northern soil with a scratch plow. Furrows were made horizontally and vertically. This led to square fields. The moldboard plow, also known as the heavy plow eliminated the need for cross plowing because single furrows were deep enough for northern lands. It was also far more efficient. This made the fields long and narrow. (White does not mention the other reason for long fields: that ox teams were hard to turn.)

The heavy plow was wheeled and required an eight ox team. This required collaboration between peasants and led to closer ties and village councils. Large fields collectively owned were doled out to villagers in sequence. In contrast, southerners using scratch plows remained individualistic. 

Diffusion of this technology was difficult and required a large population density. Another challenge was that collaboration was required between peasants to join plots together for this new farming practice. 

Nailed Horseshoes were another key invention for agriculture. In Italy the warm climate worked well for unclod horses. But in the north, the climate¬†and soil was such that horse hooves would often break. 

The need for horses to carry more weight (armored knights) led to selective breeding of destriers. These stronger horses inevitably interbred with peasant farm horses, leading to stronger offspring. 

Horses with padded collars could exert as much force as oxen. But moved much faster, so could output a lot more power. More speed let to more harrowing which was more effective at breaking up clods.

Yet the ox did not spread as quickly in England as one might expect. White suggests that this may have been because of a reluctance due to a lack of skin in the game, related to [[Does your output affect your paycheck?]].

> the real reason for his favoring the ox at the plow emerges when he remarks that 'the malice of the ploughmen does not permit a horse-drawn plough to go any faster than one pulled by oxen'. This kind of slow-down may have affected the ploughing of demesne lands done reluctantly under manorial obligation but it would not apply when peasants were working their own fields.

Other benefit of switching to horses was that they could be used as transport. During Roman times, cost of goods doubled every 100 mi of overland transport. This meant that viable farmland was situated only along rivers. During Roman times, most vehicles were two-wheeled. The first horse-drawn four-wheeled wagons appeared by 13th century and reduced overland cost so much that transport over 100 miles increased by just 30% (a 70% savings). This expanded viable farmland further from rivers, allowed a lot more farmland, and increased overall carrying capacity.

Wagon inventions:

- Pivoted front axles
- Adequate brakes
- Whipple trees

Because of the horse, peasants didn't need to rely entirely on merchants, but could get their goods to market on their own.

Horses also gave them more mobility, and many were able to move to form larger settlements and benefit from amenities there: the commune, a church, a tavern, more suitors, markets, etc. Horse as transport enabled them to commute to their fields daily.

(This is all so interesting from the perspective of complex systems and feedback
loops...)

## Three field rotation

First recorded in 763, this practice became ubiquitous by 800 (shockingly fast). Previously, Europe had practiced the two field rotation invented by Romans. The old system alternated two halves, with one planted, the other left fallow. 

The three field system split holdings into three sub-fields. The peasant planted winter crops (winter wheat or rye) on field 1, then summer crops (oats, barley, lentil, etc) on field 2, and left field 3 fallow. Next year, fields do a circular shift. 

This had many advantages over the two field rotation:

- 2/3 land utilization during the year (vs. 1/2).
- More crop variety means more resiliency to droughts.
- Better yields since legumes fix the nitrogen in the soil.
- Oats for horses! Oats are much more nutritionally rich than grass, allowing many more horses to work in agriculture. 
- A more even workload for farmers throughout the year.
- Legumes provided extra nutrition for protein starved peasantry.


# Mechanical power

Mechanical power experiments were done in antiquity - e.g. with Hero's Aeolipile, a proto-steam engine. But inventions like these did not get refined and was never put to use at scale until the middle ages.

(Not mentioned in White's book, but it appears that labor was very cheap in the early middle ages, with agricultural slaves being common. Towards the high middle ages, slaves are replaced by serfs, and are then set free to work as smallholder farmers. The cost of labor goes up further after the population is decimated by the Black Death. All of this drives the demand for cheap power.)

## Water power

Water mills became common around the 11th century. By this point the Vitruvian design had won out: a vertical wheel that turned a horizontal shaft. Earlier designs used a horizontal wheel and a vertical shaft, but did not require gears. Domesday reported that 5000 water wheels were in place for 3000 villages, circa 1086. Tidal wheels were also used, with some early examples on the Adriatic.

## Wind power

Wind power was originally harnessed in Tibet and China where mantras written on scrolls were placed on bookshelves which rotated by power of wind to increase their holiness. Windmills in Europe spread quickly. They could produce less power than water mills, but do not require a strong river flow. Also, they are immune to rivers freezing in winter or drying up in fall.

Applications of this mechanical power included mostly milling grain but also filling cloth, sawing wood, crushing olives, operating bellows for blast furnaces, turning grindstones to polish metal, mincing paper pulp. 

> The late Middle Ages has indeed been described as a ‚Äúmedieval industrial revolution based on water and wind.‚Äù

An interesting aside is that the Aelopile did have a direct application in the Middle Ages: a blower to keep fires oxygenated and burning more evenly called a sufflator.

## Pneumatic weapons

Other pneumatic devices may have been inspired by a blowgun from Malay. This design was apparently appropriated by Arabs and eventually made its way to Europe around the middle ages. If you continue the logical chain, the idea of having a barrel and a projectile means that the simple blowgun was a precursor to the musket, as well as the steam engine. Succinctly:

> The cannon is not only important in itself as a power-machine applied to warfare: it is a one-cylinder internal combustion engine, and all of our more modern motors of this type are descended from it.

Corned gunpowder was a major refinement I‚Äôd not heard of. http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2016/07/black-powder-vii-corned-powder.html?m=1

## Gravity-based weapons

Gravity based mechanical machines. The trebuchet emerged sometime in 11th (?) century and greatly improved on the Roman catapults, able to hurl 300 lb stone 300 yards using a long 50 ft lever arm and a heavy counterweight. Massive improvement over the Roman stars, 60 lb stone 450 yards. In siege warfare the mass of projectile matters most. 

# Mechanisms and mechanical engineering

Cranks‚Ä¶ not sure why this section feels so dull right now. This reader struggled through a long discussion about cranks and when they were invented. Apparently not until 10th century or so in Europe. 

Okay but seriously, cranks are important as a precursor to the pistons and in general the conversion of reciprocating motion into rotation or vice versa. If the driving force is reciprocation, you end up with a significant dead zone to get through. This is solved with a compound crank (as in a two stroke engine) and aided by Flywheels, which don‚Äôt appear until 14th century. Tangentially related, I really enjoyed [this marvelous interactive explanation on the internal combustion engine](https://ciechanow.ski/internal-combustion-engine/).

Treadles, or foot pedals that drive a rotating mechanism, are first found in China around the 2nd century, and then in Europe around the 12th century. Spinning wheels use treadles but also use belt drive and multiple subsystems that run at different speeds. 

Ultimately these increasingly sophisticated mechanisms enabled mechanical clocks, which involved many mechanisms rotating at different rates. Water clocks had been an improvement over sundials but had many shortcomings. For example, they didn‚Äôt operate in freezing temperatures. 

Was there a gravity-based alternative to water clocks? A trebuchet-like idea was used and eventually culminated in mechanical clocks in the 14th century. These clocks were extremely elaborate, less functional and more status symbols and statements.

> Giovanni's clock was only incidentally a timepiece. It included the celestial wanderings of sun, moon, and five planets. And provided a perpetual calendar of all religious feasts, both fixed and movable. 

Wrist watches were even trickier since they relied on springs which uncoiled and provided variable force during their uncoiling. These led to the [escapement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoeP0adbDKg) mechanism, and the [fusee](https://youtu.be/cpVkTSZrg_A?t=100), both impressively complex mechanisms:

> Perhaps no problem in mechanics has ever been solved so simply and so perfectly - Gawaine Baillie

It‚Äôs funny how underrated this time is from tech perspective, at least in the popular imagination. To me it feels like a veritable industrial revolution.

> Indeed, the four centuries following Leonardo, that is, until electrical energy demanded a supplementary set of devices, were less technologically engaged in discovering basic principles than in elaborating and refining those established during the four centuries before Leonardo.

# Perpetual motion

All of these mechanical inventions were inspired by the ideal of a perpetual motion machine. This was not so outlandish pre-thermodynamics, given that windmills and water mills appeared to be moving perpetually. Perpetual motion through Gravity and magnetism became the holy grail. 

Roger Bacon c. 1260 imagined:

> Machines may be made by which the largest ships, with only one man steering them, will be moved faster than if they were filled with rowers; wagons may be built which will move with incredible speed and without the aid of beasts; flying machines can be constructed in which a man... may beat the air with wings like a bird... machines will make it possible to go to the bottom of seas and rivers


Asides:

- I wondered if –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª—å comes from Carolingian. Nope, it comes from Charlemagne. That said, apparently "Carolingian" and in fact Charlemagne are both named after Charles Martel. In turn, Charles is a name from the common Germanic noun meaning "man". Go figure...
- Lots of references to Bayeux tapestry. It's [available online...](https://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/the-bayeux-tapestry/discover-the-bayeux-tapestry/explore-online/)

Overall a dense but short listen. Potpourri of new ideas, and far better than
[[Why Information Grows by Cesar Hidalgo]]. This lecture is well organized,
engagingly narrated, with memorable examples. A great, rather intense
introduction to Complexity.

A criticism I had was that Page attempts to weave too many disparate threads
together. The final chapter gives practical takeaways but they feel trite and
don't really integrate the most interesting parts from earlier in the book.

---

Here are some ideas I from the book I found interesting.

[[Wolfram‚Äôs four system types]] -
<https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p231--four-classes-of-behavior/>

[[Complexity happens in a sweet spot]] - There are four necessary conditions for
complexity. But it's necessary that all of these conditions be present in
moderate quantities. Too much or too little of any of them will lead to
equilibrium, not complexity.

[[Measuring diversity generally speaking]] - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index>

[[Dancing landscape]] - rugged landscapes that change over time.

[[Creative vs. evolutionary processes]] - Evolution is relentless and infinitely
persistent, like the tortoise. Creativity requires drive from a specific group
of people, who are finite in energy and time, but can move quickly, like the
hare. 

[[Power law vs normal distributions]] - Many things are normally distributed.
But some are power law distributed. Why? Independent events leads to normal
distribution. Interdependent events leads to power law distributions. 

[[Explore vs exploit trade-offs]] - A well formulated treatment on this subject.

[[Self-organized criticality]] - the idea that many systems approach a critical
state automatically.

[[Simulated annealing]] - an approach to finding global maximums under certain
constraints.

[[Complexity is in the eyes of the beholder]] - if you're really smart, checkers
is just tic-tac-toe, and no longer complex. Is that right?


Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks

cover: /assets/book-covers/consider-phlebas.jpg

After reading [[Player of Games by Iain M. Banks]], I wanted to read another in the Culture Series mainly for the world-building. 

Consider Phlebas is a fast paced adventure book. The protagonist Bora Horza Gobuchul is unreasonably superhuman, possessing super strength, a great fighting ability, and among many other things, the ability to change his appearance at will. He finds himself in increasingly ridiculous situations, at one point stranded on a small island populated by fanatical cannibals. I found the plot itself to be so out there, parts of it read like my 10 year old self's stream of thought in an early creative writing assignment.

That said, Banks does a good job with the world-building. Set in the middle of the Idiran - Culture war, Horza sides with the Idirans mainly out of hatred for the culture. This is a fascinating conflict, reminiscent in some ways of modern divisions between progressive leftism and traditional conservatism. The author does a great job of making both factions quite relatable, and the protagonist morally ambiguous.

Idirans are monotheists, modeled on the fervent Jewish/Muslim variety. They range from zealots to pragmatists, but all have a clear sense of identity about them. Physically and spiritually my mind renders them as the Protoss from Starcraft. Except they have three limbs, and are in symbiosis with another race of six-limbed sentient beings.

The culture is sort of a macrocosm of Western society, far more technologically advanced, and taken to an extreme. All things, strengths and weaknesses are exaggerated. They rely heavily on sentient machines, and creatively named spacecraft. The lifestyle is decadent and are subject to the [[Tyranny of Convenience]]. The have a general lack of conviction, and no skin in the game.

Ultimately, Horza is killed by an Idiran that mistrusts him. A moral lesson from Mr. Banks? The non-Hollywood ending is refreshing, given the superhero-like attributes of the protagonist.

The scale conveyed in this novel is huge, and well executed. The destruction of the Vavatch orbital is well described. Epic battle scenes are extremely cinematic and would play out well in an adaptation to the screen. But the end could have been shortened significantly. I was quite tired of the endless underground tunnels of Char's World. Overall, a fun read if you're into a fast paced, sometimes ridiculous action novel.


Why Information Grows by Cesar Hidalgo
===
posted: 2021-05-20
rating: no
cover: /assets/book-covers/why-information-grows.jpg

Why Information Grows starts off strong with an accessible introduction to information theory and some interesting physics-inspired ideas. Sadly, as the book proceeds, it becomes clear that the author has pieced together multiple essays that were and remain loosely connected. It's clearly a derivative work, often far less clear than the books that are cited.

That said, a few things stood out for me:

- Prigogine's work on [[Dissipative systems]] and their applications. 
- [[Artifacts as crystallized imagination]]
- The [[Resource curse]]


# Information is the opposite of entropy

Information is stimuli that has meaning in some context for its receiver. There is some relationship between information and complexity and information and order but Hidalgo dances around this question.

# Information in the universe is fractally distributed

Information is rare in our universe. As far as we know, Earth is one place where information is highly concentrated. Earth is to information like black holes are to matter. This observation struck me as very anthropocentric. Maybe I'm reading too much science fiction!

On Earth, information is not uniformly distributed. Specific countries, companies, and individuals seem to represent more of it.

# Rubic's cube example from an info theory perspective

The author does a decent job of explaining basic information theory. I liked his Rubic's cube example:

- There are e19 different states in the system.  
- The most information is in the lowest entropy state, the solved solid colored state
- You can‚Äôt just jump to the solved state without cheating
- It takes under twenty moves to solve a cube from any state
- Most algorithms take longer than the theoretical optimum sequence of moves.
- Most random moves cause entropy to increase.


# Information state changes are constrained

The Rubic's cube can't go from any state to any other state unless you cheat and detach the cubes from the cube's core. The only valid moves are rotations. This is a profound point that I think is super relevant for any policy discussions. Often it‚Äôs very clear what a desired state of affairs is, but very unclear how to get to there. 

# Encoding information

Application to DNA: interesting sequences that code for something important are usually the least random ones. (Really?) Notably these information rich states don‚Äôt tell us about what this DNA means. Meaningless forms of order. 

Information itself is meaningless. But can be absorbed my people to form knowledge. And practice can lead to know-how which I think is same idea as m√©tis as in [[Seeing Like a State by James Scott]] and —Å–Ω–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞. 

# Energy flows cause spontaneous order

Entropy only increases in a closed universe. Meaning that this universe has no flow of energy into or out of it. 

Ilya Romanovich Prigogine, a Russian Jewish born Belgian studied [[Dissapative systems]], which are systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with substantial steady-state flows of energy. Earth is such a system because the sun is the source of all our power.

In situations where there is a steady state, there is a tendency for spontaneous order. A whirlpool will spontaneously appear when you open the drain to a bath tub. Are there other simple examples?

This is super cool! Imagine all of life as a sort of very complex whirlpool. Actually, Ted Chiang kinda did in a more poetic version of this idea found in the story called Exhalation. [[Exhalation by Ted Chiang]]

# Information can be stored in solids

Information can be preserved, and this preservation is best done in a solid state of matter, especially if it is non-uniform (eg. not a simple solid crystal, more like an organic molecule). The canonical example of this is DNA. 

I didn't really like Zen and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but this quote works well here:

> That's all the motorcycle is, a system of concepts worked out in steel. There's no part in it, no shape in it, that is not out of someone's mind - Robert M. Pirsig


# Goldilocks zone for information to appear and remain

Interesting analogy to physics: a desirable temperature range. you need liquidity for information to grow (eg. Whirlpool example, as well as the notion of liquid networks from [[Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson]]). But if it‚Äôs too liquid, solids can‚Äôt form to store that information. 

> There are no long chains of proteins in the sun

Energy is needed for information to emerge and solids are needed for information to endure. For information to explode we need the ability of matter to compute. 


# Simple computation, very broadly defined

Hidalgo defines computation extremely broadly. You don‚Äôt even need life for computation to occur in the natural world. He introduces a simple example of computation, a [chemical clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_clock), in which a set of regents can be mixed together to make a reaction that transitions in states at predictable time frames. Trees also compute in a similar way. 

I don't really see what practical connection there is to computation the way we think of it more colloquially. 

# Products as crystallized imagination

Everyone uses toothpaste. Very few know how to produce sodium fluoride, or how to get it into that tiny tube. Toothpaste the product gives billions of people access to the practical benefits that a small group of toothpaste inventors created. Products allow us to transcend our individual limits. Toothpaste gives everyone the ability to maintain our teeth into old age. 

Crystallized information comes in many forms. Most of human activity is like this. Writing, speaking, music making, dancing. But Hidalgo only cares about products. Products empower others with practical uses of your ideas. 

The economy then is the substrate that allows products to spread from one individual to another. 

I'm mildly annoyed at the author for:

1. Not really justifying why he's so obsessed with products specifically. From an information growth perspective, does art not also compound?
2. Calling these things "products". It's very capitalist-y for no good reason. I strongly prefer artifacts.

# The bad stuff

The first part of the book discussing information theory and Prirogine's ideas was quite good. 

Next, Hidalgo tries to apply information theory to people, companies, countries, and the global economy. This gets increasingly awkward. 


## Personbytes, a useless analogy

The personbyte is a transparently info theory derived quantity that's supposed to somehow represent a person's raw potential, I guess? The analogy is not great but illustrates a point. The information-theory notion of a byte is clean and mathematically precise. Applying it to people seems oddly reductive. People vary hugely in their potential and are products of their culture which is perpetually evolving. Stripped of this, we are just smart monkeys. My personal preference is to not introduce this faux-information theory concept. The same points could be made better without it.

Hidalgo's ultimate point is well taken: that the crystallized imagination encoded in artifacts increase your own imaginative potential. This puts you in a sort of a network with other people, and being part of this network lets you create more complex output. It‚Äôs much easier to build an electric scooter if your job is to put pieces together rather than inventing battery, electric motors, aluminum welds etc.


## Firmbytes...

Hidalgo continues down this road and introduces the firmbyte, a unit of quantization for companies. Similar critiques apply.

Ford once had a plant called [The Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_River_Rouge_Complex) that created cars end-to-end, taking iron ore, soy beans, rubber as input, then performing the whole manufacturing process (refining, smelting, forming, cauterizing, etc). This facility spanned an area roughly 2km x 2km and employed 100,000 people. This isn't common practice anymore.

Manufacturers don‚Äôt generally own the whole production line from raw material to final product. There is a natural unit size for a company, and that is the firmbyte. Again, extremely fuzzy, maybe inspired by information theory. Do not want.

The point here is even weaker: some things require multiple companies, or firmbytes to create. If there's too much friction to doing deals between companies, large networks can't be formed. Free trade agreements and standardization reduce friction between companies.

## Imagination trade imbalances

Blending the idea of crystallized imagination and global trade, Hidalgo considers trade imbalances from the perspective of imagination. In the trade between Korea and Honduras, there is an imagination trade imbalance, with Korea providing in the commodity of imagination. He then ranks countries in terms of how much information capital they produce. Again, meh. 

Hidalgo touches a bit on the [[Resource curse]]. This would be interesting to understand in more detail. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse


## More derivative stuff

In the spirit of being a random amalgamation of cool ideas Hidalgo likes:

- High trust enables lower transaction costs, as per [[Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam]]
- Family is for communism, market is for capitalism.  [[Debt by David Graeber]]



Emotional Life of the Toddler
===
posted: 2021-05-06
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/emotional-life-toddler.jpg

"Every generation Western Civilization is invaded by barbarians. We call them children." ‚Äî Hannah Arendt

Alicia F. Lieberman begins with a milder version of the same sentiment:

> In the raising of every toddler, society recapitulates its own development. When a child is caught between the impulse to strike out and the fear of its consequences, conscience begins to be formed and civilization begins.

# Relatable vignettes

Mom speaks very highly of a classic Russian book called [–û—Ç –î–≤—É—Ö –¥–æ –ü—è—Ç–∏](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%82_%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%85_%D0%B4%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B8) (from Two to Five) which is a sort of proto-listicle of funny things small children say. It's fun, but I feel that as a parent I get a lot of these gems delivered to me on a daily basis from my own children.

Anyway, the author cites this exact book on toddler creativity. Struck me as a relatively rare of example of US-Russian citation.

Many vignettes are dispersed throughout this book too, some instructive and very relatable scenes. For example of Sonia, a 2.5 year old who sings loudly at the dinner table, diverting attention from the adult guest conversation.

Other stories are more creative and thought provoking, or just plain funny:

> Damian is sitting at a table in his day care center, slowly moving his jaws and mouth while staring into space. "What are you chewing, Damian?" asks his caregiver. "I'm chewing Mommy," replies Damian dreamily.' 

Somehow the author can contain her laughter and respond seriously and eloquently:

> Damien's answer tells us with haikulike conciseness about a major aspect of the toddler's child care experience: missing the parent, yet holding on to her through a combination of memory, hope, and imagination. By chewing on his mother's image, Damian is carrying her in the most reliable place of all-inside himself.


# Raw human insight

When words are not enough:

> Putting things into words has an inherent alienating effect because the part of the experience that remains unnamed is cut off and fragmented from the portion that is given official existence through language... When a precious toy is broken, words such as "sad" or "disappointed" cannoy possibly capture the enormity of the child's loss... 

> Coaxing children to express their feelings in words before they are ready alienates them from access to the unspeakable realms of experience and teaches them wrongly that talking is equivalent to feeling.

On age-related fear:

> Throughout the life cycle the age-specific sources of anxiety have to do with life tasks we understand only imperfectly and have many fantasies about. For junior toddlers, this may center on movement and toilet training; for senior toddlers and 3- and 4-year-olds, on the differences between boys and girls and how babies are made; for young adults, on the secrets of love; for very old people, on the mysteries of death and the world beyond. We tend to be afraid of what we do not know, and toddlers are no exception.‚Äù

On play as simulation

> Erik Erikson proposed the theory that play is the childhood version of a lifelong human propensity: setting up model situations to experiment with different ways of controlling reality. While playing, the toddler relives past events and in this process alleviates lingering anxiety and fear over what happened by ‚Äúplaying it out," just as adults derive emotional relief by ‚Äútalking it out."

On toddlers vs. teenagers (I am afeared):

> Not until adolescence will parents face as many dilemmas in rais ing their children as they do in the toddler years. In fact, the second and third years of life are excellent practice for the challenges posed by a teenager. Toddlerhood resembles adolescence because of the ra pidity of physical growth and because of the impulse to break loose of parental boundaries. At both ages, the struggle for independence exists hand in hand with the often hidden wish to be contained and protected while striving to move forward in the world. 

# Other notes

Interesting take on parental discord: sometimes it's okay to resolve mild disagreements in front of a toddler. This demonstrates how adults resolve conflict. Doing this may be better than trying to hide animosity and build up an atmosphere of tension.

Great passage on guilt. Scenario with Cynthia not wanting to stay with a babysitter. She is precocious and tells her mom things like ‚ÄúI will miss you too much‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy are you going without me?‚Äù Her mom feels bad, alternating between reassurance that it‚Äôll be fine and admonishment that the child should stop whining. 

The remedy? A less accepting response. Assert with confidence that it‚Äôs gonna be ok. 

> Won‚Äôt Cynthia fee guilty if she is told that her mother doesn‚Äôt arove of her behavior? If she does her ability to feel guilty at 40 months will actually speak well for her emotional development. As they grow children like adults need to experience remorse when they do something that is not acceptable to others. Guilt is a useful emotion when felt in response to specific damaging behavior. It is unhealthy only when it is pervasive, as in the Case of children who constantly worry they‚Äôre doing something wrong. 

# Concluding...

The formula of this book is to take ordinary moments in child rearing, buttress them with funny and creative anecdotes, and then deliver profound truths about human existence.

This is not a "how to" guide, or a collection of weird tricks to raise your children. It's so far the best written child rearing book I've encountered.

High Middle Ages
===
posted: 2021-05-03
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/high-middle-ages.jpg

Why study the middle ages, and history in general? Daileader provides a pragmatic answer:

- Some things seem like artifacts of modernity, but are a millennium old.
- Others appear fundamental and static, but are in fact very recent and ephemeral.

Unless we can get the story straight, we'll have the wrong intuitions about the world today.

# Sandwich age

Petrarch (13th century) believed that classical Greco-Roman art and culture was the apogee of humanity. After the fall of Rome, which he dated to the sack of Rome in 410, everything went downhill. Naturalism went out the window in favor of abstraction. The Latin language became corrupted. It was all horseshit! Petrarch hoped that his lifetime would see a return to classical values. His hope came true with the emerging Renaissance. Thus, two great eras in human history (classical & renaissance) sandwiched a middle age so terrible it doesn't even deserve a proper name.

During the romantic period, the Middle Ages were viewed with nostalgia. Dirty, polluted, overworked people sought philosophers like Rousseau, who pined for the lush greenery of the past. Marx's vision of constant conflict between classes was seen in contrast to the harmonious system of [[The Three Orders]] of the Middle Age.

Medeival is just how you say Middle Age in Latin. Love it when simple things click into place. 

# Population explosion

Europe's population roughly doubled during the high middle ages (1000-1300), in contrast to [[Early Middle Ages]] (300-1000), where late Rome was charaterized by depopulation, followed by stagnation 700-1000. The era that followed, the [[Late Middle Ages]] were pummeled by the black death leading again to a decline in population. [[Depopulation is often correlated with decline]]

Around 1000¬†CE, Europe was very rural. Cities had at most 10,000 people living in them. By 1300 many towns grow into cities and have 100,000 residents. 

Why this growth?
1. Decline in foreign attacks (Arabs, Vikings, Magyar marauders), partly because all of the good stuff had already been looted.
2. Roman slave populations were so poorly treated, their populations were declining. As more slaves became serfs, they were treated better and could have higher birth rates.
3. Advances in agricultural technology
2. Climate change: 800 - 1200 is called the [Medeival Warm Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period) a period of improved climate, improving crop yields.

As European cities grew, they became worthwhile stops for global merchants, since their markets now became big enough to be interesting. Italy dominated in trade because of its central position in the mediterranean. It's no accident that the famous Marco Polo emerges from Italy in 1270.

The monetary system also evolves around this time. At the height of Rome, a tri-metallic system was in place. Large transactions were done in gold coins, while bronze and copper coins were used for small daily transactions. By 1000, the continent regressed to a a much simpler system, relying on just silver for all transactions. By 1252, gold coinage was reintroduced by Florence: the florin. Small transactions were done in low quality silver. Related: [[History of global mediums of exchange]].

# Aside on agricultural technology

(Interesting: all three of these are energy efficiency-related...)

## Scratch plows => Moldboard plows

As the Roman empire grew, the Scratch plow began to spread to northern Europe. This plow was designed with a short sharpened wooden stake, making shallow scratchy furrows well suited to dry Mediterranean soil. In contrast, Northern European soils were waterlogged and dense in clay, and the scratch plow hardly made a dent in such soil. [Seed ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield#Seed_ratio) in the early Middle Ages were abysmal, something like 2:1. 

With the introduction of the Moldboard Plow (aka Heavy Plow) from eastern Europe, seed ratios improved drastically. This plow was far heavier, required wheels to move, and a much deeper, metal cutting blade. 

## Ox yokes => Horse collars

Romans used oxen to till the soil. These dumb animals were easily domesticated but slow. To pull a plow, a wooden device called a yoke would sit on top of the ox and the beast would plod across the length of a field. Plots tilled by oxen were long and narrow since ox teams were so hard to turn. [[Second order effects and unintended consequences]]

Horses were much faster, but equally strong as oxen. However their anatomy was quite different from an ox, and the strap of the ox yoke would sit across the horse's neck, pressing on its windpipe. This not only reduced air supply reducing efficiency, but was also often fatal.

The padded horse collar was constructed with leather, and slipped over the horse's shoulders and did not cross its neck at all, allowing it to breathe freely. In addition to not causing broken windpipe related death, it increased horsepower by 5x.

## Water mills

Romans knew about water mills, but did not build them very often. Slaves were so readily available in Rome that they could be relied on to power hand mills, a laborious and incredibly boring process of manually turning a crank. But as agricultural slavery was replaced by serfdom, European rivers become the new laborers.

## ...Crop rotation

Not mentioned in the lecture, but the [Three Field System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-field_system) of crop rotation seems to have emerged around the same time, and made big improvements to crop yields. The core insight there was that  Cereal crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. So one plot would be used for cereals, another for legumes, and the third to replenish itself, rotating every year.

# Those who fought

In early Middle Ages knights were thugs. But they became increasingly legitimate in their power. As merchants became increasingly affluent and more of them wanted to join the ranks of the knights, there was a problem of [[Elite overproduction]].  The fighting class (see [[The Three Orders]]) became so numerous that money alone stopped being enough to join. Now to be dubbed a knight you needed to prove that your bloodline was noble.

After the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the 9th century, noble infighting soared to dangerous highs. The church attempted to curtail this trend by designating days and periods in the calendar as peaceful through programs such as the Peace and Truce of God. [Courtesy Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_book) were uninteresting lists written in Latin and ultimately fell on deaf ears, or into the hands of largely illiterate ruling class. These attempts did little to curtail noble violence.

## Chivalric Romances

Chaplains were clergy members in the courts of noblemen. They were the most worldly of the clergy class and could thus find ways to appeal to the fighting class. The approach that worked turned out to be the new literary genre of Chivalric Romances, around 13th century. These were stories that depicted heroic knights on great adventures of love and conquest. The chivalric code insisted on romantic love with a woman in order to ‚Äúcivilize‚Äù a knight and encourage good deeds. 

Chr√©tien de Troyes wrote simple stories exploring the balance between fighting and loving. In some, the hero focused too much on loving his wife and lost status in the field, causing his wife to leave him. In others, he focused too much on conquest at the expense of his relationship. Damned if you do, and damned if you don‚Äôt. Lancelot is a more complex classic, who had an extramarital affair with Arthur‚Äôs wife Gwyn.

## Tournaments

Early tournaments around the 11th century evolved from free-for-all mounted melees taking place on large swaths of territory. They were not aimed explicitly at killing but at capture, but the structure was so loose that all bets were off. Action occurred with real weapons, and had real impacts on innocent bystanders, as well as other externalities. Crops were trampled, houses burned, peasants murdered. Not to mention the large death toll among the fighters. 

King and clergy attempted to ban tournaments outright, but failed Instead, they evolved and became more formalized, converging to the 1-on-1 jousting matches with dulled lances and a barrier wall to prevent head on collisions. Knights that broke with chivalric norms, speaking ill of women or hurting the helpless, were disinvited from such gatherings. 

## Feudalism

A special relationship between members of the fighting class began to emerge: lord and vassal. A rising knight could swear an oath of fealty to a lord and become his vassal. This relationship involved rights and responsibilities:

- The lord gave his vassal a fief, usually a plot of land that the vassal would manage and collect income from. The lord would defend the vassal from harm.
- The vassal would come to the lord's aid, usually in a military campaign. The vassal would also give advice to the lord, if the lord requested it.

Gradually, fiefs became hereditary. Eventually vassals began swearing fealty to multiple lords. The concept of liege lord was introduced to indicate the main lord that you are sworn to, but vassals would just swear fealty to multiple liege lords. People are awesome!

# Those who worked

The¬†status of ordinary folk generally improved during the period of 1000-1300. Agricultural slavery faded out and was replaced by serfdom. Most peasants of the time were serfs working for a lord, sometimes a noble, and sometimes a bishopric or monastery. As serfs, they owed their lord seigneurial obligations, meaning they had to till the land for free some number of days a week.

Serfdom gradually became less onerous and less common. Serfs that spent a year in a city would automatically become free, and many would escape in this manner. Lords would treat their serfs better to avoid losing their unpaid workforce entirely. More of the population moved into towns.

Townspeople were split into populo grosso (fat people), consisting of merchants and landlords and populo minuto (little people), consisting of artisans and farmers. 

During periods of heightened violence, towns formed communes, associations of mutual defense which attempted to maintain peace, militia style. These associations were led by elected Consuls, elected for a set term, often a year. Consuls judged when members of the commune were injured, and decided when to exact vengeance.

A town would have one commune, but each trade was governed by its own guild: the bakers, the dyers, etc. To practice a trade you needed to belong to the guild. Guilds enforced the quality of work produced by its members and standardized production and distribution of goods to ensure that nobody had an unfair advantage.

# Those who prayed 

Secular clergy: priests headed by a bishop at a bishopric.
Regular clergy: monks headed by an abbot at a monastery.

Most monasteries were based on a Benedictine laws which were focused on austerity. In practice, many of these laws were bent and broken, especially by orphans and retirees, and others that found themselves in monasteries for reasons outside their own control. Monks could not own property of any sort, at least in theory. But in practice this was often not the case. Monasteries themselves were often rich, beneficiaries of large donations from non-monks as alms, with donors hoping to offset their misdeeds.

## Attempts at reform

At various points monastic reforms were attempted to bring monasteries closer to their platonic ideal. Two ecclesiastical reform movements stand out, often for the cruelty gave their abbots: [Cluniacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluniac_Reforms) and [Cistercians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians). But these reverted to the mean within a couple of centuries. 

Franciscans took a different route, insisting on a new kind of monk that does not belong to a monastery at all. Instead he must own nothing and beg for alms, mimicking the life of the apostles. They were led by St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226), who had pretty intense views. St. Francis did not permit his followers to store up money or provisions for a rainy day, since this indicated a lack of faith. Eventually the Franciscans were recognized by the papacy and their hard-line stances diluted.

The Gregorian movement attempted to reform the secular clergy. It enforced priestly celibacy, which had become uncommon. Simony, the practice of buying bishopric or abbotal appointments, was banned again. It was already illegal, but often eluded in practice. These reforms largely failed, sowing seeds for popular discontent with the church.

## Freethinkers and heretics

As lay people became more literate, they began reading the Bible themselves and coming to their own conclusions. Literacy was highest in urban areas, where merchant class needed to be numerate and literate to do their work. (TODO: what was the actual spread of writing like over time and space? Has this been mapped in detail?)

This combination led to high rates of heresy, self described Christians that challenged the basic tenets of the faith. 

[Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) had a different take on Christianity. Cathars believed that the good God was the God of the New Testament, creator of the spiritual realm, whereas the evil God was the God of the Old Testament, creator of the physical world whom many Cathars identified as Satan. This was against the teachings of the church and they were labeled heretics. Waldenzians, followers of Peter Waldo shared a similar fate.

## Inquisition

During the episcopal inquisition, bishops were asked to double down on the task of ensuring purity of belief of those in their bishopric, weeding out heretics. But many bishops resided in Rome or Paris and not in their bishopric. And bishops were generally very important and busy individuals.

When this failed, professional inquisitors were hired instead. Many of these were taken from the Franciscan and Dominican orders, already used to traveling and begging for alms. These inquisitors would go from village to village and ask the local priest to gather the residents together. The inquisitors were then trained to try to extract as much information as possible. Those that volunteered dirt on their fellow villagers early on would be rewarded with lighter sentences.

Torture by this point was common in Medieval justice. Inquisitors were allowed to use it too, but could not cause bloodshed, mutilation or death. When a subject was found guilty of heresy, they might be forced to wear a yellow cross on their clothing for the rest of their life. Or they would be handed over to the secular authorities to be burned alive.


# Jews of the High Middle ages

As mentioned ad nauseam in [[The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler]], Jews were often expelled from kingdoms. I even made a list of [[History of Jewish Expulsions]].

Why? It was an easy way for kings to make quick money. They would seize Jewish assets and take ownership of all outstanding loans. But this would disrupt the economy, so these measures were often reverted quickly. 

Jews were also forced to wear a badge (star, circle, etc) or a conical cap. Visual indicators were also forced on other minorities, like heretics ([yellow cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathar_yellow_cross)), prostitutes (yellow dress?), and lepers (rattle, clapper). Jews liked the privacy of living in their own enclaves, but the badges were universally hated. It made Jews visible targets of pogroms. The distinguishing badges could sometimes be removed by paying the sovereign a fee. The king would then annul this deal and force Jews to pay again, another money making scheme.

Especially dangerous times for Jews:

- Crusades would often trigger local pogroms, as echoes of holy war would resonate at home.
- Easter sometimes saw accusations of blood libel, where Jews were accused of crucifying a Christian child gone missing from a village. No coincidence too with Christ‚Äôs death. Blood libel was only a popular belief, never an official position. 

During the high Middle Ages 1000-1300 prosperity increased but so did anti Jewish violence. 

# Intellectual progress

Monk style education involved rote memorization and recitation. There was no space for intellectual activity because it would open up the possibility of heresy. 

## Scholastic philosophers

Scholastic movement: beginning a tradition of comparison of multiple sources with the goal of synthesizing two seemingly incompatible perspectives into something coherent. Through valiant hoop jumping they seemed to be able to get to an interesting equilibrium. 

[Abelard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard) was an early famous Scholastic with a colorful but gruesome story. He began a tradition of debate, with explicit reliance on old texts - bible and derived works (eg. St. Augustine), but also blended it with the pagan philosophers like Aristotle and Plato.

Classic philosophers were accessible thanks to Islamic preservation efforts, especially the work of Ibn Rushd of Al-Andulus (Averroes). (Why was he not mentioned in [[Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr]]? Seems like that book devoted no time at all to Al-Andulus, just the caliphate centered at Baghdad.)

Scholastic practices were criticized and censored by the church. Their reliance on reason was seen as having excess hubris. Who are they to think that they can contribute something worthy of the great ancient thinkers? Also their reliance on Aristotle and Islamic commentaries and insufficiently on the Bible was seen as problematic. Indeed Aristotle directly contradicted church dogma on some issues. According to Aristotle,

1. The world is eternal, never created
2. There are no souls, only a collective soul
3. There is one God greater than the other Gods, but he is not omnipotent or omniscient

The church attempted to censor Aristotle but ultimately failed. Some Scholastic philosophers were accused of ‚Äú[double truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_truth)‚Äù or of arriving at two different conclusions on an issue depending on whether they considered from a Christian or an Aristotelian perspective.

The most prominent scholastic scholar, St. Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican friar was canonized shortly after his death, illustrating the church's capitulation. Aquinas blended rationalism into Christianity. His magnum opus "Summa Theologica" contained five proofs for the existence of God.

According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.


## Early Universities

Strange sub-plot with early universities. The first two universities in Europe were in Paris and in Bologna. 

Students of universities were called [Clerici vagantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerici_vagantes) or vagabundi, Latin for wandering clergy. They were considered to be part of the secular clergy, and subject to special privileges as a result. No one was allowed to physically harm them; they could only be tried for crimes in an ecclesiastical court, and were thus immune from any corporal punishment. Students took advantage of this and broke secular laws with impunity, engaging in theft, rape, and murder. 

One side effect of students as clergy was that under Canon Law, women could only be part of the regular clergy (nuns), but not part of the secular clergy, so were banned outright from universities.

# The First Crusade

Pilgrimages had been a common practice in Christendom, and increasingly Jerusalem was seen as as destination for penitential pilgrimage. Holy war also had precedents: clergy had previously sponsored battles in which death was linked to salvation.

Crusaders were both pilgrims and holy warriors. This was a brilliant innovation which made the proposition extremely attractive to many people. Pilgrimage was dangerous, but here you were armed to the teeth and could fend for yourself. If you died en route, you would die as a holy warrior. However if you arrived at your destination, you would have fulfilled the pilgrimage. To sweeten the deal, crusaders were given plenary indulgences, remission of all penalties that resulted from sin. Win-win-win!

Crusades were declared by popes, and often for political reasons. The first crusade came shortly after the schism in the papacy. In this schism 1054, numerous disagreements between the Byzantines and the pope came to a head. Two sides failed to come to an agreement and severed ties. Shortly thereafter, the Byzantines were crushed by an Arab invasion. The sitting western pope wanted to try to reunite the church and offered military aid to the east in the form of the first crusade.

## Popular crusade

The first part of the first crusade was led by common people. Many of these crusaders took a detour to first kill a bunch of Jews and loot their stuff in order to finance the trip to Jerusalem. This was done partly from sheer anti-semitism and holy war fervor, but partly from Millenarian convictions that the world would soon end, and that the ends to their salvation justified the means. 

When this first wave of crusaders arrived to rendezvous with Byzantine forces, they arrived earlier than expected, were ill-equipped and hungry. This led to skirmishes among the Christians of the east and the west. Eventually those Popular Crusaders that survived were slaughtered by the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor.

## Baron's crusade

A colorful story, this time about the adventures of crusading knights of noble rank. About 7000 departed from various European kingdoms organized in loose bands under a variety of local leaders. When they arrived at Constantinople to rendezvous with the Byzantines they were not greeted kindly by the Byzantine king Alexios I. Having just been ravished by the people‚Äôs crusade he did not trust the westerners and insisted they sign a treaty to ensure territories recently owned by Byzantines would be returned to them. 

First taking [Nicaea in 1097](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Nicaea), then [Antioch in 1098](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Antioch), joint Crusader-Byzantine forces marched toward Jerusalem. However these victories only further eroded relations between east and west. The crusaders took Antioch, and left no prisoners, and their leader Bohemond decided to keep the city for himself, breaching the oath he swore to Alexios. Multiple waves of Muslim reinforcements attempted to take back the city, besieging the crusaders. The crusading knights nearly perished from famine. 

A lowly priest named Peter Bartholomew had a vision wherein St. Andrew came to him and told him that the [Holy Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance) was in Antioch. Enthralled by this, the crusaders began to dig in the cathedral in search for the Holy Lance. Initially coming up empty, Peter joined in the digging and found the object he was looking for, which boosted morale significantly. After fasting for 5 days, the already famished knights sortied out of the garrison with Raymond of Toulouse at the head, carrying the Holy Lance. Despite his general's suggestions, the Turkish commander decided to let all of the knights exit the city walls before engaging them in battle. Soon the Muslim troops were in panicked retreat.

After several months of rest at Antioch, a decimated crusading army set out for the ultimate goal Jerusalem in 1099. Another priest, Peter Desiderius had a vision: if the crusaders circumscribed the Jerusalem walls barefoot, the city would fall within nine days. Befuddled defenders spared these erratic barefoot knights. Sure enough, Jerusalem fell in seven days. This is shocking given an invading force of 1500 against city walls. Unmentioned in the lecture was the fact that an additional 10,000 infantrymen came as reinforcements via Jaffa. Using wood from the boats, Genoese engineers built two huge siege towers (called Malvoisin or "Bad Neighbors"), catapults and a battering ram. Eyewitnesses reported gruesome crusading with the entire population of the city indiscriminately murdered. 

This first crusade marked a turning point in European standing on the world stage, previously clearly inferior to their more technological and culturally developed Muslim neighbors. 

# Norman conquest ‚Äî meanwhile in England 

The next few lectures were a review of [[The Story of Medieval England]], but the enlarged scope of this lecture made for some new insights.

The Normans were partly Franks but also partly descendants of north men, Vikings that were invited to settle in western France by the Franks in an attempt to prevent other Vikings from raiding and pillaging. 

Vikings seem to have settled often despite their reputation. They were a key genetic component to the Russian (see [[The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler]]), French, and English people.

- Exchequer an early accountant system in England. The name comes from the checkered board in which counters representing debts were moved around.
- Domesday book: is this something where age rounding has been analyzed? Might be a cool baseline. Sadly, doesn't appear to include ages, according to the data in https://opendomesday.org/.
- How can I find digitized versions of early censuses? [[Age Heaping and Numeracy]]

After the Norman conquest, there was an interesting dynamic between England and France. The French speaking Normans that conquered England were vassals to the French king. As a result, William the conqueror and his descendants like Henry II were both feudal subordinates and equals to the French kings. Things got especially weird when the English monarchs controlled large tracts of France (called the [Angevin Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_Empire)) through strategic marriages. 

# Meanwhile in France

By 987 France was being raided by Magyars, Vikings, and Arabs. The kings were no longer able to retain power. Aristocrats rebelled and split the Carolingian kingdom into smaller units. The subsequent dynasty that takes over is led by Hugh Capet, first of the Capetians. Under their watch France further fragmented into duchies and beyond. But the dynasty's lineage continued despite the fragmentation. This continuity helped prevent civil wars which usual meant bad news for the ruling family. 

Learning from the mistakes of the Merovingians and Carolingians, the Capetians changed their succession style. The practiced anticipatory succession and picked an heir before your death. Rather than splitting the kingdom between all of the king's sons, the firstborn was given the kingdom, and his brothers received Appenages (see [[Primogeniture vs partible inheritance]]).

Eventually Louis VI the Fat began to try and assemble the disintegrated French kingdom. He retakes √éle-de-France in relentless military attacks against the castellans that resided there. This became the base for expansion, a place to reimpose authority on rebel lords. 

The Capetians waited patiently for opportunities to retake their holdings. They would buy out barons that went bankrupt. They would annex the duchy of a dead duke with no clear heirs.

Phillip II Augustus was the best known king in the Capetian dynasty, an unlikely ruler. Compared to his contemporary Richard Lionheart, he was not much of a warrior, shunning crusading. Instead, he focused on trying to recover French lands that were now in English hands due to the Angevin Empire. At first, he tried to turn King John against his brother Richard but his scheme failed. Finally he decided to exploit the feudal relationship with English kings. He summoned John to nominally resolve a dispute between John and one of his French vassals. When John failed to show up, Philip declared his vassal John Lackland's possessions in the European continent forfeit. 

Philip begins repossessing English lands on the continent. First he took Normandy, then Anjou. John forms an alliance with German king Otto of Brunswick. In 1214, a joint English-German invasion of France begins to try to retake back the Angevin lands. Philip II defeats Otto at the [Battle of Bouvines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bouvines). Upon seeing the Germans crushed, John retreats fearing a similar fate. This confirms Philip's reconquest, leaving just a small region in the French southwest under English control. 

Around the same time, the pope declared a crusade against the south of France known as the [Cathar Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade). Supposedly those in the south were harboring Cathar heretics and thus needed to be cleansed, one of the major cities harboring them was Carcassonne. This was a twenty year affair, extremely bloody. Overall this led the decentralized French political system (discussed in early Middle Ages), further damaged by English conquest, to centralize again under a powerful king. See [[Decentralization and Centralization cycles]]


# England's Canterbury Debacles

A bit more review of [[The Story of Medieval England]], but Thomas Beckett's story is truly fascinating. Appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury by Henry II, Thomas Beckett, personal friend of the king quickly turns on him. Rather than buttressing royal power as expected by Henry, Beckett strongly criticized the corrupt system of royal ecclesiastical appointments. His subversion exiles him to Paris for 6 years, but upon returning, Beckett continues as before. Apocryphally, Henry II asks ‚Äúwill no one rid me of this pesky priest?‚Äù, whereupon four of his knights travel to Canterbury and kill Beckett in cold blood in his own cathedral. Beckett is quickly canonized and Henry II pays the price both in PR and by being embarrassingly lashed by monks.

Henry II's son John is also tied up by a [long quarrel at Canterbury in 1205](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_election_of_1205): after the prior archbishop dies, the monks elected a new one, egged on by a doctrine of Papal Supremacy. This is legal but not how the English king liked it ‚Äî it was normally an appointment in practice. John refuses the election and instead pressured the monks to select his preferred candidate. They agreed to this but the two archbishop candidates both insisted on their legitimacy. As a result the papacy intervenes and insists that both candidates are invalid and that a third archbishop be selected. John refuses this and the pope declares an interdict, a sort of clerical strike in which only key services like baptisms are done. This lasts 6 years and John finally gives in when Innocent III begins to support John's deposition. Ultimately the pope's candidate Stephen Langton becomes Archbishop of Canterbury. Throughout this long period, King John does nothing to retake English possessions retaken by Phillip II, giving him time to prepare.

English barons in France were in a weird position: are they now loyal to France, or to England? They pressured John Lackland to retake the lands. Finally after the botched English-German attack on France, the English barons rebel. They take London and force John to accept the Magma Carta. 

# Magna Carta

A lot of the Magma Carta contains detailed articles that were designed to limit the king's power. Article 39 had more longstanding relevance to us, imposed formal legal restraints on royal will, declaring that no action detrimental to a free man‚Äôs life, limb or property was to be taken without a prior judgment in a lawfully constituted court. Within a year John rejects the Magna Carta and then promptly dies. His son Henry III accepts it and has a long reign, paving the path toward a fledgling parliament.

Henry III used the parliament to seek financial aid. The Barons agreed but pushed back, insisting on the [Provisions of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisions_of_Oxford), which gave a group of barons representation in the king's government. The king would gather and consult Great Councils on occasion. These would sometimes include commoners as well as barons. Initially mostly to collect money, these gradually became more formalized in time, soon were done thrice a year. 

Despite all this turmoil, 13th century England had a strong and stable monarchy, at least compared to France and Germany. This led barons to really push back on the monarchy and lobby for more power. This led to rudimentary checks and balances and eventually English Common Law. In weaker states, there was less need for these balances since the king was already weak. Thus when countries like France centralized again, their monarchs became extremely powerful, their power unchecked.

# Meanwhile in Germany

Holy Roman emperors in the territory of Germany had done well for themselves while France was fallen apart into smaller pieces. These Teutonic rulers held a firm grasp on the church through the practice of investiture, in which kings appointed important abbots and bishops. 

## Investiture controversy

Popes had extra leverage over Holy Roman Emperors since the pope was the only individual allowed to crown an emperor, a tradition that went back to Constantine. As part of Gregorian reforms, pope Gregory VII decided to take action against investiture. He terminated a group of imperially appointed bishops in Italy (part of the Holy Roman Empire). In response, Emperor Henry IV wrote a letter denouncing the pope and calling for his resignation. To which Gregory responded, I‚Äôm not fired ‚Äî you‚Äôre fired. He excommunicated and deposed Henry IV. German elites then took advantage of the mess, and decided to rebel against their ruler. As a result, Henry IV rushed back to Rome to apologize to the pope. 

The apology led to a temporary truce, but it was clear to the pope that it was not a sincere apology. Also, the German aristocracy was not done rebelling. They declare an alternative candidate, Rudolph as German King. Three years later, Gregory VII declared his support for Rudolph and excommunicated Henry IV. In response, Henry IV declares a new pope and lays siege to Rome with the intent of forcibly replacing the current pope with his candidate known as [Antipope Clement III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_Clement_III). Pope Gregory VII comes close to death as Henry IV takes Rome in 1084, but is saved by an army of Normans that the pope calls on for help. They arrive and force Henry to retreat, but in their zeal [plunder Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_(1084)).

Eventually several imperial generations later, a truce is reached under the Concordat of Worms (pronounced Verms). This compromise ends the practice of investiture but allows an imperial representative to weigh in on clerical elections. The German kingdom loses power and standing. Enterprising aristocrats use this opportunity to build castles and otherwise entrench their own power base, similar to what happened in France centuries earlier.

The Ottonian dynasty doesn‚Äôt fare as well as the Capetians. Overall Henry IV reign shows the weakness of Germany in the 13th century.

- too dependent on their aristocracy, who were keen to take advantage of any weakness.
- too dependent on the papacy, leading to crusades being launched against the Holy Roman Empire.

## Collapse of the Holy Roman Empire

Frederic II was a famous member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The end of his reign marks the point of complete disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick's contemporaries called him stupor mundi, the "astonishment of the world".

Born in Sicily, Frederic II was fluent in Arabic. He was well read and even wrote books about hawking. Early in his reign he went on crusade, took a vow to participate or risked excommunication, by then a common issue between kings of Germany and popes. He fell ill (or may have pretended to do so) on his voyage to Jerusalem. The pope promptly excommunicated him and prevented him from continuing the crusade until excommunication was lifted. However, to lift excommunication, pope Gregory IX requested a small gift: Sicily.

Frederic II ignored all of the above and continued on to Jerusalem. Taking advantage of Muslim infighting of the time, he secured Jerusalem for Christendom through diplomacy alone. However the pope was resentful, calling Frederic preambulus Antichristi and denied this treaty. Instead, a papal army marched on Sicily. Frederic was not greeted warmly in Jerusalem by fellow Christians because of an interdict. Frederic II returned quickly to Sicily to quash the papal forces. 

A tentative peace breaks out for a decade. Pope Gregory IX, then his successor Innocent IV called for [a crusade against Frederic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Crusade). Crusaders with vows to the east are allowed to change course to fight Frederic II instead. Some of his own subjects turn against him. Civil wars rage beyond Frederic II's death in 1250, and Germany disintegrates further. The papacy denies election of further members of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The result is a final decimation of the Holy Roman Empire into a loose confederacy with an elected emperor. 



Thirteenth Tribe
===

cover: /assets/book-covers/thirteenth-tribe.jpg

When I came across The Thirteenth Tribe, I knew that the stars had aligned. I just finished [[Early Middle Ages]] and really enjoyed [[Darkness at Noon by Arthur Koestler]] by Arthur Koestler. 

The first half of the book focuses on the facts. Who were the Khazars? Who were the Rus? Where did these people come from? How did they interact with dominant Byzantines, Ummayads, Abassids? It's super readable and more engaging than prior lectures on the subject matter. That said, I feel that having listened to [[Early Middle Ages]] was a bit of a prerequisite. It would have been too hard to keep track of the major players otherwise.

In contrast, the remainder of the book is way more speculative. Koestler seems to have started with a thesis: Ashkenazi Jews are Khazars. A narrative then is carefully constructed gather the relevant evidence. However given that this is all set in Dark Ages, the facts are inherently sparse and shrouded in uncertainty. 

# Conversion and neutrality

The Khazars converted to Judaism because choosing Christianity or Islam would put them under the authority of either Baghdad or Constantinople. Their decision to convert may have been mostly a pragmatic one on these grounds. Reminds me of that quote attributed to Napoleon:

> "It is by making myself Catholic that I brought peace to Brittany and Vend√©e. It is by making myself Italian that I won minds in Italy. It is by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt. If I governed a nation of Jews, I should reestablish the Temple of Solomon."

The Khazars adopted Hebrew script too. Some Hebrew letters, ◊© and ◊¶ made it into Cyrillic as —à and —Ü, after St. Cyril learned their language in Crimea.

Becoming a neutral territory meant that those fleeing forced conversion in Christendom and Islam world had a natural safe haven. Many Greek pagans and their rich classical traditions found their way to Khazaria. So did many Jews of the diaspora. 

The conversion is chronicled by a Khazar king Joseph, in [an exchange of letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_Correspondence) with Hasdai ibn Shaprut, a Jewish doctor living in Al-Andalus (modern Spain). In his response, Joseph recounts the Khazar conversion story. After dropping idolatry, King Bulan, sometime in the 8th century needed to choose between the three dominant religions. He gathered a panel of representatives and asked each separately which of the other two religions were least wrong. Judaism won by elimination, since both Christian and Muslim had greater affinity to it than to one another.

The Khazars seem to have been karaiites, meaning that they rejected the rabbinical teachings completely, and only followed the Torah. Meanwhile the rest of the diaspora, concentrated largely in Baghdad and large cities in Al-Andalus like Cordoba, practiced rabbinical Judaism, with a Gaon at the head.


# How Khazaria worked

The Khazars were a Turcik people ruled by a system of dual kingship. The Khagan was the nominal ruler and figurehead. Menawhile the general executive and military general was called the Khagan Bek. Upon end of reign the Khagan was ritually killed.

Khazaria was a buffer state situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, shielding the Byzantine Empire from both Vikings and Arabs. 

Perhaps there's a map in the printed version of this book, but I listened to it and found myself floundering a bit on the geography front. Embarassingly I found it hard to keep all of the rivers (Volga, Dniepr, Don, Ural) straight. I spent a bit of time and put [all the things on a map](https://borismus.github.io/central-asia-maps/), including two major cities, Atil the capital, and Sarkel, the remains of which were flooded by the Soviets in the 1950s.


# Varangians and Khazar decline

The Varangians were Vikings. In the 9th century, they set out on large expeditions with the goal of raiding, trading, and sometimes a combination of both - "forced trade", as Koestler politely puts it. A typical raiding party would be composed of 500 longships of 100 people each. Vikings didn't usually establish permanent settlements outside of their traditional territories, but the Varangians were an exception.

When this group of vikings moved into the territory of modern Ukraine and Russia, they settled down near Kiev and became known as the Rus. They intermingled with native Slavs. Olga is Helga, Oleg is Helgi. Ivan, Ingvarr. Vladimir, Valdamarr. Mind, Blown.

Early Kievan Rus was a shit show. After Igor son of Rurik was killed by a tribe of Slavs called the Drevlians, his wife Olga exacted sweet revenge on them. Igor and Olga had a son, Sviatoslav, who was also a military hero and legendary warrior. Their children caused a civil war for succession. As Koestler would have us think, most of these early Rus regends tended to lead debaucherous lives and then convert to Christianity on their death bed. Some to be subsequently canonized. 

Vladimir, son of Sviatoslav decided it was time to pick a religion. He did so in a Khazar-like fashion. Summoning delegation of representatives. The result is described by the chronicler Nestor:

- Of the **Muslim** Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them, only sorrow and a great stench. He also reported that Islam was undesirable due to its taboo against alcoholic beverages and pork. Vladimir remarked on the occasion: "Drinking is the joy of all Rus'. We cannot exist without that pleasure."
- Ukrainian and Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with **Jewish** envoys and questioning them about their religion, but ultimately rejecting it as well, saying that their loss of Jerusalem was evidence that they had been abandoned by God.

# Rus ‚öîÔ∏è Khazars

Khazaria and the Byzantines had a long standing alliance. But with price Vladimir‚Äôs conversion to orthodoxy, a union Of the Rus and Byzantine was cemented, paving the road for a joint campaign against Khazaria which was already weakened by then.

Additionally, the Khazars levied a 10% tax on traders going through their lands. This ticked off Viking Rus who were capable of trading and raiding.

Sviatoslav destroyed Sarquel and Atil. He had a reputation for having Berserkers in his ranks, from norse legend.

> "The Rus' attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch."

# After the Khazar empire collapsed

Chronologically, first the Khazar empire fell, then new Jewish settlements began to spring up in Poland. Clearly there was some flow between one and the other, but experts disagree how much of the population came from Khazars and how much from Jews ethnically tracing back to ancient Israelites. Koestler suggests that most Jews in Poland came from the Khazar empire, while a mere trickle joined from Spain.

Around this time the Shtetl began to emerge in Poland-Lithuanian empire. Origin dates to the 13th century.

Interesting connection between the kippa and the [Tubeteika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubeteika), or traditional headwear of steppe dwellers. 

# A chronicle of suffering

During the crusades, many Jews were forced to convert and many communities chose to self-immolate and die as martyrs. 

> Many Jews of Maeonce, Strasbourg, Spires, ... escaped from centers and left their posessesions to kindly Burgers.

![[History of Jewish Expulsions]]

# Controversial conclusions

According to Koestler, Khazars moved permanently west. Emigration from Poland followed the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, which codified anti Semitic practices by forcing Jews to wear special clothing, yellow bands and conical hats. The mostly Khazar Jews fled west from Poland Lithuania into Germany France Palestine and USA.

A big part of Koestler's thesis is that the differences between Jews and gentiles living in the same country are much smaller than difference between Jews living in different countries. Thus he claims that there is no real such thing as a Jewish race.

Apparently Koestler told French biologist Pierre Debray-Ritzen he "was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews (the ancestors of today's Ashkenazim) were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for anti-Semitism would be removed and anti-Semitism itself could disappear".


# Random stuff

- Realized that there were two Justinians. Justinian I was discussed in [[Early Middle Ages]], but here it's Justinian II Rhinotmetos (noseless). He lost his nose after being overthrown and sent into exile, but then came back and became Emperor again!
- Apparently splitting a man in twain by attaching his arms to two trees and felling them was a common penalty for adultery. Poetic Justice.
- There was a Rus invasion of Constantinople in 860, which was also described in [[Early Middle Ages]].
- Koestler keeps talking about "Russian Chronicle". Apparently it's [Nestor's letopis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Chronicle).
- Matthias Mieses is an oft-cited historian. Who was he? A German-only Wikipedia entry suggests he was a historian of Yiddish.
- Interesting analysis from the evolution perspective of Jews in the ghetto effect of them. Three things: inbreeding, genetic drift, and selection pressure.
- The Jews spoke so many languages in the past. Very flexible and dependent on the empire they found themselves in. Koestler presents a list.
- Interesting observation from Koestler in final appendix of Thirteenth Tribe: in his estimation, the greatest Jewish contributions are not in Yiddish and Ladino, but in German, English, French.

Koestler attempted to discourage misuse of his theory by hedging extensively in the conclusion, saying that Israel's right to exist is based on the UN mandate and not on Biblical covenants or genetic inheritance.

Sadly, Koestler's theory has been used extensively by Arab anti-Zionists, and white supremacists alike. Anyway, the first half is great, but the remainder can be safely skipped.

That all said, this Khazar question is historically fascinating, shrouded in mystery, and full of people on both sides, exhibiting classic motivated reasoning. We'll see where I eventually land.

12 hours dedicated to the period from 300 to 1000 CE, often called the Dark Ages. The modern official nomenclature refers to the fact that sources on the time period are scarce. The lecturer distances from the colloquial usage of backwardness, decline, evil, etc. 

# Late Rome

Rome was in shambles around the third century. Wars with Persia, conflict with barbarians. The [Crisis of the Third Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century) saw 50 emperors in 25 years!

Diocletian finally stabilized Rome by imposing authoritarian measures. He militarized Roman society, dismantled any vestiges of the old Roman republic, and split empire in Twain, taking the eastern Roman Empire for himself. The new structure involved an emperor (title Augustus) in the east and in the west, each paired with an understudy-successor (title Caesar). Diocletian thought he was pretty dope, and changed his title from Primus inter pares (first among equals) to Dominus (master).

Constantine converted to Christianity in 312 and many followed his lead, although Senators often held out and savored their pagan traditions.¬†The only imperial attempt to revert to paganism by Julian the Apostate completely failed. He was the only pagan emperor after Constantine.

The transition from Rome to the Fall of Rome was varied depending on locale within the Roman empire. In many areas it was quite gradual. In Rome, the last emperor's deposition in 473 had no bearing on day to day life. Commerce was still done in Roman coins, barbarian peoples still enjoyed Roman traditions. 


## St. Augustine and Early Christian thinking

St. Augustine's life is a mirror through which to try to gleam religious morality of the period. He was first inspired by Manicheanism, later Neo-platonism, and finally developed original ideas that were the basis for rigid, early Christian doctrines.

Manichaeans: inspired by a Persian school. Good and evil is in perpetual gridlock, neither able to overpower the other.

Neo-platonists: God is everything and everything is good. Some things may appear evil, but that's just because God got distracted.

Athletes of God: not sure how widespread, but around 300 CE there were many famous cases of people turning to asceticism and other extremes in the name of worshipping the Christian God.


## Fall of Rome in the west

These barbarian tribes took on a lot of Roman traditions and lifestyles. Many became practically indistinguishable from their Roman counterparts. 

In England, a distant outpost of Rome, Christianity was lost well before the last emperor, along with literacy. Interesting example of regression in civilization.

Irish monks retained their Christianity and eventually settled in Britain, bringing their religion back to England. They were extremely serious in their interpretation of monastic life. Part of this was due to the fact that Anglia retained its Celtic language which was Germanic and very different from Latin. So studying the scriptures was substantially more difficult because of the language barrier. 

When Irish monks exported their version of Catholicism to the world, including Italy and Spain, it was a hardened take on the subject. 

## Rome in the east

The eastern Roman empire lasted for a long time. Eventually it fell in 1453 due to largely to Arab invaders. The east diverged significantly after Diocletian split the empire in two. For example, it switched to Greek as the main language. 

One of the most successful Byzantine emperors, Justinian made some attempts to reunite the empire, successfully conquering the North African Vandal kingdom. He made peace with the Persians in the east, establishing an ‚Äúeternal treaty‚Äù. However just as he was attempting to reconquer Italy, the Persians break the treaty and invade from the east, sacking cities and gaining territories in Palestine and Syria. This misstep, as well as the appearance of the Plague of Justinian, put an end to Justinian's ambition.

> The Plague of Justinian is the first and the best known outbreak of the first plague pandemic, which continued to recur until the middle of the 8th century. Some historians believe the first plague pandemic was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 15‚Äì100 million people during two centuries of recurrence, a death toll equivalent to 25‚Äì60% of Europe's population at the time of the first outbreak.

The Byzantine empire was constantly besieged by the Arabs from the south, by Persians from the east, and sometimes by Slavs and other barbarians from the north. Many attempts were made on Constantinople, including a [joint siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(626)) by Persian and Slav armies in 626.

# Francia after Rome

As Rome was collapsing, The Franks established Frankia, a kingdom preceding modern France. Clovis I was the best known ruler of the Merovingian dynasty. This dynasty suffered from problems of succession. They split their inheritance between children, and due to bad luck had a long strain of many child-rulers. Eventually they lost control and were replaced by the Carolingians, initially Pippin II, but later Charles Martell (the hammer), who made significant gains pushing back against the invading Arabs. 

## Iconoclasm

The pope remained tied to the Byzantine empire for many centuries after last western Roman emperor. However, as the empire became increasingly besieged it was less capable and interested in protecting assets of the church. To raise money for a large army to defend against Muslims, the Byzantine emperor Leo III instituted a new tax. But since church interests were not being adequately protected, the pope refused to pay it. [[History of the world viewed through the lens of taxes]]

Leo III then demanded destruction of holy icons, a core practice of the still unified church. It's pretty unclear why this happened, perhaps an attempt to emulate successful Islamic tradition? At any rate, the pope refused and eventually the papacy turned away from Byzantine and the East in general, so much that popes, who had long been from Greece, now weren‚Äôt sourced from there for 800 years. It's the dark ages, things are murky, but there's more speculation [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Iconoclasm).

This wasn‚Äôt quite the schism yet tho. That‚Äôs later. 

The papacy found itself without protection. The Carolingians under Pippin III (son of Charles Martel) wanted to make their ascension legitimate and saw an opportunity. To officially depose the still Merovingian king, they struck a deal with the pope: legitimate us, and we will defend your interests against the Lombards in northern Italy. Thus did the church's power¬†and attention shift towards the West.

## Charlemagne

Charlemagne, Charles I, aka Charles Magnus, aka Charles the Great, was named after his grandfather Charles Martel, the hammer that successfully pushed back against many Arab invaders. Charlemagne eventually inherits the whole Carolingian empire, first splitting it with his brother Carloman. The names are really too much!

Charlemagne stands out as the greatest Carolingian, and reconquers more territory, including lands not originally in the Roman empire. He struggles much more against the Saxons than against the Lombards. The Saxons were primitive and distributed, actually consisting of many tiny tribes. Conversely, the Lombards were developed city dwellers with a capital city in Padua. Conquering the capital meant capitulation.

Does this generalize? Do we necessarily become less resilient as civilization progresses? Seems unlikely. [[Distributed is more resilient]]

## Carolingian Renaissance

Charlemagne's rule in the 9th century coincided with a golden age. 

Latin at this point was just a wildly evolving colloquial language which was slowly evolving into French, Spanish and Italian, depending on the region.

Around this period, Irish and Anglosaxon missionaries were spreading their faith far and wide. When they landed in the Carolingian empire, they were distinguished by their classical Latin, which remained unadulterated by their main germanic tongue. These monks found inconsistencies between many versions of holy scriptures and sought to consolidate back to their purest form. Charlemagne too did not believe in divine omniscience and insisted on addressing God in proper Latin. 

During this period, bishops became much better educated and much better stewards of the religion. Meanwhile priests remained unrefined. Priesthood tests involved with very basic questions about the faith and included an answer key, suggesting a low level of theological sophistication. Also interesting is the use of standardized testing for this purpose.

To help bring about more literacy the Carolingian Rennaisance is an early example of writing reform, helping usher in [[Carolingian minuscule]], which introduced lower case letters, spaces between words, basic punctuation, and other hints to help make reading easier.

## Treaty of Verdun

Carolingians and Merovingians both suffered from being too equitable in splitting inheritance along their heirs. This led to conflicts between the heirs often military and loss of stability. Charlemagne got "lucky", since by his death, all of his kids were dead except Louis the Pious. The Carolingian Rennaisance continued under his watch. But Louis' successors saw Carolingian power collapse. [[Primogeniture and other methods of splitting inheritance]]

Louis the Pious declared his successors when he was just 40, decades before his death. His three sons quickly rebelled against him. After an extended kerfuffle involving Louis' imprisonment to a monastery on two separate occasions, an equilibrium was reached between his three surviving children: Lothair, the eldest controlled Middle Francia (approx. Italy). Louis, a younger son from the same marriage controlled East Francia (approx. Germany), and Charles, much younger and from another marriage, controlled West Francia (approx. France).

# Carolingian decomposition: France and Germany

Under Charlemagne, the empire was subdivided into counties each governed by an appointed count, accountable to the emperor. This is a nice illustration of an anti-democratic principle at play, succinctly formulated by Fukuyama as [[Higher political bodies should be answerable to lower ones not vice versa]]. 

As the Carolingian Empire succumbed to infighting and Viking invaders, Counts began to gain more power. To secure their alliance in war, Kings began to give Counts multiple counties. The office of Count became hereditary and no longer appointed. Counts, not Kings begin appointing local bishops and abbots, and creating their own law courts. This process is known as [[Devolution of Power]]. By 900 there are 30 principalities in West Francia, many of which prevented the King from even visiting. A similar process occurred in East Francia, but instead Dukes (a level above Count) retained power. As a result, the east was less fragmented, into about 5 Dutchies. 

The West fragments fractally as Castellan do the same to their local Counts as what Counts did to Carolingian Kings. Under Charlemagne, Castellans were a public office, appointed by the ruler and non hereditary. But this breaks down as part of the process of devolution. These castelins assume titles of Dominus (Lord). Increasingly their castles are built of stone, not wood as before.

These lords then impose power in their realm, typically a 15 mile radius circle around the castle. To enforce their lordship, they hire Knights as mafia-like enforcers. Knights multiply in numbers, get fiefdoms, and we converge to feudalism.  

By this point, the King is effectively elected official, selected by Counts that hold the real power. This process of devolution is really interesting as a way of transforming a top-down hierarchy into one that turns bottom up, at least up to some rung. Clearly not all the way, since commoners, serfs and slaves were fully excluded from these power games. Does this apply to corporations in some way?

# Teutonicum / Germany

Holy Roman Empire

# Meanwhile in Spain/Al-Andalus

Not taking too many notes here, since a lot of the material overlaps with [[Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr]]. The [[Jizya tax]] stood out as especially interesting, in the perverse incentives it created. If too many Christians and Jews converted to Islam, the Arab leaders would lose their tax base!

The visigoths in Spain were quickly overrun but Arab invaders, who established an Umayyad kingdom there, and eventually self-declared a Caliphate. 

Initially a dusty outpost of the Islamic world, by the 10th century Al-Andalus became a significant, urbanized and diverse region in Europe. The capital at Cordoba dwarfed any other European centers, with population around 100-250k. In contrast, population of Paris at the time was perhaps 20k, and London perhaps 10k.

The Arabs brought with them irrigation techniques acquired to survive in harsh deserts, relying on gravity to relay water from Oases many tens of miles away. They also brought with them new crops like rice, sugar cane and cotton, which became staples of Spanish food, and instrumental in the New World. They brought a great amount of high culture, math, and astronomy, and the region became dominant so that contemporary European mathematicians like [Gerbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_II) would flock to Al-Andalus for access to the greatest minds of the time, as well as preserved writings of Greek philosophers. 

# England

Alfred the Great... zoned out a bit because it was mostly recap of [[The Story of Medieval England]].

## From Slavery to Serfdom

Fantastic historical perspective on serfdom as actually a substantial improvement to quality of life. 

Roman latifundia were large estates controlled by wealthy romans. These were mostly tilled by agricultural slaves, acquired as war booty. These slaves have no rights at all, not even to their offspring or their spouses. They could not own anything at all and generally lived in terrrible conditions. 

Estates would typically consist of one or both of these: 
1. The demesne (or domain) of the lord, which a serf is required to till some number of days a week for no pay.
2. The tenantship allotted to each serf, from which the lord gets a cut, but is fundamentally tied to the serf. Except if the serf dies childless, in which case posessions would revert to the lord by [Mortmain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortmain).

By the 10th century, slavery is mostly gone, but it‚Äôs not fully rooted.

# Feudalism

The feudal system based on lords and vassals was put in place around this same time. Vassals would swear fealty to their lords. This would grant them a fief, usually heritable property within their lord's holdings. In Latin, fief is feudum, from which feudalism comes from, and this is a central notion to the idea. In exchange for the fief, the vassal must come to the lord's aid in war, and generally give them advice when it is requested by the overlord. 

(For some reason, this reminds me a lot of a corporate structure, where the fief is a steady salary, and the war is with the code.)

Family structure changed as a result of Christianity. Completely novel ideas came about, borrowing neither from Roman nor barbarism traditions, but driven more by the church. Two interesting examples:

- Prohibition of cousin marriage, up to 6th cousins! I can barely track my lineage that far.
- Delegalizaton of concubinage, which apparently is not always as nefarious as it sounds. In Ancient Rome, concubinage "was an institution of quasi-marriage between Roman citizens who for various reasons did not want to enter into a full marriage".


# Aside on technology

## Knights

Knights first emerged during the reign of Charlemagne. They relied on a few different technologies:

- **Stirrups** from Central Asia enabled a much more stable ride. 
- **High backed saddles** increased stability especially in case of frontal impact that would normally throw you backwards.
- **Couching lances**, meaning tucking a weighted spear under your arm as you charge. This put all of the horse's momentum into the spear tip for an extremely devastating blow. 

This is a fascinating general direction, see [[Horse related inventions]].

## Viking longboats

Vikings initially were great traders, establishing vast trade routes throughout the world. Archaeological digs at [Helgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helg%C3%B6) recovered  Buddha statues from India dating to the 6th century. Eventually Viking traders turned into Viking raiders, conducting seasonal raids in the Carolingian empire and in Britain.

One of their secret weapons was the longboat, able to carry about 100 men with very shallow draft enabled transport of raiders over seas, but also critically, to enter rivers that would normally be inaccessible.

Vikings would often establish semi-permanent bases from which to conduct yearly raids on especially plentiful targets.


# Conclusion and some historiography

The Dark Ages are shrouded in mystery but two famous historians devoted their lives to studying the period.

- Edward Gibbon wrote The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in 1776
- Henri Pirenne was a Belgian historian, wrote Mohammed and Charlemagne in 1937.

Gibbon attributed the fall of Rome to Christianity. On his analysis, the religion made Romans too laconic and insufficient concerned about this world, more concerned about the world to come. As a result, they could not muster up the energy to withstand barbarism incursions. This is unconvincing since he pegs collapse at the date of deposition of the last western emperor. Meanwhile the eastern Roman empire lasts another millennium. And it‚Äôs actually the more Christian half. 

Pirenne doesn't accept that the Roman empire fell in the 5th century at all. He attributes eventual collapse to economic decline and the Arab invasions around the 8th century. 

Daileader, the lecturer, has a better explanation: depopulation. Strangely, no symptoms of depopulation appear in any of the prior lectures. It's a bit odd to conclude with a completely new insight.

According to the lecturer, Roman population declined greatly between 2nd and 7th centuries, which led to inability to defend against various Euro-barbarians, Arabs, etc. There's apparently tons of archaeological evidence for this: declining sizes of cities as witnessed by receding city walls. Main reasons for the population decline may have been diseases: The Plague of Cyprian in the 3rd century CE, the Plague of Justinian in 6th century CE (first known occurence of Yersinia pestis, the Justinianic plague), and [others](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/plagues-roman-empire/473862/).

Gibbon and Pirenne saw Carolingian period as a low point in European history. Modern historians don't associate Dark Ages with a cultural darkness or decline, but a period lacking primary sources. Culturally and economically, the Carolingian Renaissance seems to have pushed Europe out of a decline, spurred on by exchanges with Vikings who had huge trade networks, and cultural interactions with Arabs who were just ramping up.

Another GB recommendation that I really enjoyed. It's hard to summarize this book succinctly since it is such a potpourri of different fields and ideas.

# A different lens on Evolution

> Evolution is the ultimate treasure hunter, searching for nothing and finding everything

Evolution works under a constraint: whatever it produces must survive to reproduce. "Survival of the fittest" is the most popular conception of this process but does not capture any nuance. 

> The problem with competition as a general explanation for creativity is that it usually drives towards everything converging to the best. Selection is not really a creative force: It focuses and optimizes, and ultimately restricts exploration

Forces at play in evolution:

- Competition doesn't actually increase interestingness, but enforces the constraint of genetic survival.
- Genetic drift is the process by which frequency of alleles changes over time as a result of luck. If a given trait doesn‚Äôt affect an organism‚Äôs ability to survive or reproduce (for example, the color of an organism‚Äôs bones), then natural selection will not direct that trait in one way or another, and its evolution will instead drift. 
- Exaptation is the process of co-option of an evolved ability to do something else. For example, feathers first evolved in dinosaurs, where they helped to regulate temperature. Only later did evolution exploit them as a stepping stone to flight. 
- Niche finding is a way to shield an organism from competition. If an organism can make a living in a new way, then it has effectively founded its own niche. A new niche often makes founding newer niches possible, and such newer niches often lead to even newer ones.

As much as I disliked [[Finite and Infinite Games]], this discussion of evolution reminds me of it a bit. The only goal of an infinite game is to keep playing.

In an interesting twist, even our human inventions can be considered an evolutionary process since they were created by us, the products of evolution.

> The bottom line is that many of our greatest engineering aspirations‚Äîsuch as flight, solar power, artificial intelligence‚Äîwere not the explicit objective of evolution, though it created all of them.


# Invention and stepping stones

A key metaphor often used to explain non-objective search processes is that of crossing a lake using stepping stones in dense fog.

> Because of the fog, you don‚Äôt know where either path leads. For all you know, one might lead you to a dead end while the other eventually might reach the other side of the lake. 

The dense fog is a great metaphor for [[Bounded rationality]]. The stepping stones are a good metaphor for the idea of the [[Adjacent possible]]. Each stepping stone must also be stable to support your weight as you cross, which is a great metaphor for [[Stable intermediate forms]].

> If we really behave as treasure hunters and stepping stone collectors, then the only important thing about a stepping stone is that it leads to more stepping stones, period.

The authors make sweeping claims like the following:

> Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind.

[[Profiles of the Future]] makes a distinction between expected and unexpected inventions. This book's framework applies most clearly to unexpected inventions (eg. nuclear energy). These unexpected inventions are shrouded by fog. They are too many stepping stones away to be seen. 

Expected inventions (eg. flying machines) fall less neatly into this metaphor. They are like hills above the fog, but you can't quite figure out the path to get there. On the other hand, once you get close enough to that hill, something that was completely out of reach becomes attainable.

This idea of invention as a process of groping for the next stone in the dense fog makes it clear that learnings from the history of science are inherently limited. Again that McLuhan quote about walking backwards into the future comes to mind.

> Contrary to popular belief, great inventors don‚Äôt peer into the distant future. A¬†false visionary might try to look past the horizon, but a true innovator looks nearby for the next stepping stone. The successful inventor asks where we can get from here rather than how we can get there. It‚Äôs a subtle yet profound difference. Instead of wasting effort on far-off grandiose visions, they concentrate on the edge of what‚Äôs possible today.

This reminds me of my [[Asimov's Tech Tree]] project, and that I really should re-think it as follows. Consider an impactful modern invention and work backwards through all of the inventions its inventors were inspired by. Then repeat this process, creating a tree culminating in this invention. This view would serve to illustrate the many surprising new horizons that one invention enables. Examples include the way that looms and vacuum tubes lead to computers, and smartphones led to better batteries, and better batteries led to electric cars. Authors included a few other uncited example I found interesting:

> For example, the space race yielded innovations like cochlear implants, memory foam mattresses, freeze-dried food, and improved emergency blankets.

In many cases, the inventor is driven by a search for the interesting and novel. Art often follows this pattern too, since it is more often done for its own sake. This is a very fluid process involving a lot of gut feeling, hunches and intuition. As many inventors do this, the process compounds.

> The important point is that novelty (and interestingness) can compound over time by continually making new things possible.


# Picbreeder and other open-ended search applications

The authors rely mostly on Picbreeder, but also on other projects from their research on open-endedness to make their point, which can be boiled down to this:

> The more troubling lesson is that objective-driven search is sometimes embarrassingly incompetent.

They built a walking robot simulator and compared optimization to open-ended search. They found that the robot that tried to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply tried to do something novel again and again. They explain it like this:

> Falling down and kicking your legs may be a better stepping stone than trying to take a step (because kicking your legs is the foundation of oscillation, which is how walking works), but if walking is the objective, falling down is considered one of the worst things you can do.

They built a maze solver which would take considerably longer to solve mazes that were deceptive, meaning that they had deliberate dead-ends.

Images in [Picbreeder](http://picbreeder.org/) are generated from a DNA-like code which can *mutate* to create a different but related images. Following the evolution analogy, visitors to the website can vote on images as a form of *selection*. 

I did something similar with [[Evogami]], but with a much simpler mapping from DNA to object.

These examples are all really neat, but all deal with very specific domains: simulated walking robots, mazes, images, simulated paper. How to go from these narrow fields to something as all-encompassing as evolution remains unclear to me.

# Evolution tends towards complexity

The authors pose a good question: if single celled bacteria can do the job of reproducing, why bother creating more complex offspring?

> all organisms begin their life as single cells and end up reproducing to create offspring who also start as single cells‚Äîand this simple strategy for reproduction is effective‚Äîwhat objective utility is there in doing the same thing, but in more and more complicated ways?

By viewing evolution as an open-ended search process, you end up with complexity necessarily.

> As Stephen Jay Gould has pointed out in evolution, once all the simple ways to live are exhausted, the only way to create a new species or niche is to become more complex

# Strange vibes and nitpicks

> In a sense, over eons our bodies have become a kind of encyclopedia of facts about the universe in which they exist. Eyes represent the presence of light in the universe. Ears signify mechanical vibration. Legs are reflections of gravity, and lungs of oxygen.

This is suspicious. Most organs in the body are pretty mysterious from this perspective. 

A lot of this book rails against [[Perils of optimization]] and warns about maximizing meaningless metrics, along the lines of the [[McNamara Fallacy - choose meaningful metrics]] and the infamous cobra breeding story associated with [[Goodhart's law - indicators will be gamed]]. This reminds me a lot of Illich and the [[Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization]] discussion.

> You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America: school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, anything that a politician can run on, anything that someone can get a promotion on. And as soon as you invent that statistical category, fifty people in that institution will be at work trying to figure out a way to make it look as if progress is occurring when actually none is.



How to Take Smart Notes
===

cover: /assets/book-covers/take-smart-notes.jpg

Zettelkasten Method, In Praise of Niklas Luhmann, or Ode To The Slip-box.

The Roam cult sprang out of a practice called Zettelkasten. I refuse to join the cult, but see great value in cross-linked note taking practice. So far my tool of choice is Obsidian, mainly because I like plaintext. This book introduces the Zettel method.

> It is not possible to think systematically without writing - Niklas Luhmann

**Tools for your own thoughts**: Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman‚Äôs notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such ‚Äúwonderful records of Feynman‚Äôs thinking.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù Feynman protested. ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.‚Äù

**A mirror of your brain**: These notes are not meant for external consumption. They are meant to be a reflection and formalization of your thoughts. As you think about a topic, your mental model of the topic evolves, as does this collection of interlinked notes. Even if your memory fades, you can return to your notes and continue where you left off.

**A communication partner**: The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to ‚Ä¶ ? What is the difference between ‚Ä¶ ? What is it similar to?

**Integrate seemingly unrelated sources**: This is especially powerful as a way to integrate learnings from multiple sources into one place. "When we turn to the slip-box, its inner connectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts." Read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.

**Same format, same place**: Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. No underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. Write brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. 

**Keep notes short**: By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling. This will¬†also allow for more ready interconnections.

**Avoid premature linearization**: ‚ÄòHave the courage to use your own understanding,‚Äô is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.‚Äù Prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes achieves the opposite of what teachers intend to do. The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. 

**Feedback loops emerge**: The addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas. The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn‚Äôt even yours, but someone else‚Äôs. It is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.

**Take it slow**: it takes time to evolve any idea, and this is another benefit of the slip-box. Related to [[Slow hunch]]. Taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place.

**Work on many ideas in parallel**: Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.

**Don't force a direction**: Luhmann‚Äôs answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities.

**Publishing by finding a path in the graph**: once you have this densely linked note cloud, and you want to cobble together an idea for others to consume, you weave a path through your graph and create a linear narrative. "We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts."


Three kinds of notes:

1. Temporary notes: which are designed to be processed and converted into something more permanent.
2. Permanent notes: (aka Matuschak's Evergreen Notes) contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way.
3. Project notes: project specific, should theoretically be kept in a separate place.

General reasons for keeping notes:

- [We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)
- Zeigarnik effect
- Charles Darwin forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories.
- Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it. Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture.

> ‚ÄúOn one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that‚Äôs important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both ‚Ä¶ The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.‚Äù - Jeremy Dean


Thinking in Systems: A Primer
===
posted: 2021-02-10
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/thinking-in-systems.jpg

Thanks to a book club at work, I finally read this legendary book.

A system is a set of entities interconnected to produce behavior over time in response to external events. For example, a slinky's behavior lies within the slinky itself. 

Modernist thinking tends to like simple causal connections. However reality is complex. Systems thinking is an interesting and valuable lens that complements high modernism. 

One way of looking at systems thinking is as a formalization of folk wisdom:

- a stitch in time saves nine
- the rich get richer, the poor get poorer
- don't put all of your eggs in one basket

# What are systems?

Systems have:

- discrete parts
- parts¬†that interact with one another
- parts which together produce an effect that is different than each interaction

‚ÄúYou think that because you understand ‚Äúone‚Äù that you must therefore understand ‚Äútwo‚Äù because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand ‚Äúand.‚Äù - Sufi teaching story

System components in order of importance:

- purpose / function
- interconnections 
- elements (often interchangeable, eg. employees)

Systems are composed of stocks and of flows. Stocks are the amount of a thing. Flows are the increases or decreases of said thing. Think of a bathtub with a faucet and a drain. The water in the bathtub is the stock. The faucet is the flow of water in. The drain is the flow of water out. Flows can change quickly: you can shut on and off the faucet, plug the drain. Stocks change slowly and act as buffers: even if you open the drain completely, it will still take a minute for the water to vanish.

Types of feedback loops:

- Amplifying feedback loop: the more stock there is, the higher the flow.
- Balancing feedback loop: attempts to move stock to a desired state.

Real world systems are affected by multiple feedback loops simultaneously.

# One stock systems

## Two balancing loops (eg. Thermostat)

Stock: temperature.
1. Balancing 1: Exterior temperature cools the room to be the same temperature as outside, flow is tempered by insulation, air gaps, etc.
2. Balancing 2: Heater warms the room until it is the temperature set on the thermostat.

## One amplifying and one balancing loop (eg. Population Growth)

Stock: population.
1. Amplifying: the more people there are, the more people are born. 
2. Balancing: people don't live forever. There's a death rate.

Ultimate behavior will depend on which of the two dominates. If reinforcing dominates, end up with exponential growth. Many other examples like this, such as capital growth, where the more capital you have, the more you can make, but there's also depreciation costs.

# Two stock systems

## Renewable stock constrained by non-renewable stock  (eg. Coal Mining)

Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.

Stock 2: Coal.
1. Balancing: as the coal mine depletes, it becomes harder to extract the last bits of coal. 

## Renewable stock backed by renewable resource (eg. Fishing) 

Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.

Stock 2: Fish.
1. Amplifying: the more fish there are, the more fish are born.
2. Balancing: as the population dwindles, it becomes harder to find the last fish. 


# Great insights

**Constrained by stocks vs. flows**: non-renewable resources are constrained by stocks. Renewable resources are constrained by flows. 

**Stocks act as buffers**: rivers often flood because flow >> stock. Lakes rarely do because flow << stock. 

**Delays really matter** in reality many of these loops are driven by information that is delayed. This results in oscillations.

**Stable intermediate forms**: another important concept.  Hierarchies mean that there are independent sub-systems which are independently stable. This enables a rise in complexity. 

**Limiting factors** are an intuitive but important idea. A systems is affected by the stock that is in least supply. As a system grows, the most limiting stock may change. 

**Resilience involves many balancing loops**, most of which are inactive most of the time. Example: under normal circumstances, you don't sweat or shiver. But without these abilities you would be far less resilient.

**Dominant loops** complex systems are made of multiple feedback loops, and which loop dominates the others makes a big difference. For example, in a population grouwth system, if the amplifying loop dominates, the population will grow exponentially, but if the balancing loop dominates, it will shrink.

# Stray thoughts

Firstly, what a great collection of insights! But to call it a coherent book is a bit generous. I feel like it's not well structured, and found myself picking out nuggets rather than being swept away by a coherent narrative.

It‚Äôs hard to understand as an audio book. Need visual and ideally interactive diagrams. 

Systems thinking is a great technique for CEOs, businessmen, macroeconomists. It's less clear how a pleb like me might apply it. But it's still interesting!

It would be worthwhile to contrast the causal diagrams of the sort Judea Pearl champions with these systems feedback loop diagrams.

# Traps and remedies

Systems have common failure modes. Here are some of the ones I found novel. The remedies are often easier said than done.

**Policy resistance**. many actors are all invested in an equilibrium involving one stock. Each pulls the supply up and down to their own benefit. Everyone exerts a lot of effort but achieves little. 
Remedy: let go. Find another thing all parties can agree on. 

**Tragedy of the commons**, a common resource or sink is overused by each user, leading to ultimate ruin because of erosion effects. The term was coined much later than I thought: in 1968. 
Remedy: either apply pressure appealing to morality/decency/religion, split and privatize the commons, or impose penalties for overuse.  

**Drift to low performance**, a gradual degradation in quality because of a moving performance goal. If quality is under the bar, the bar is set lower, often excused by sentiment like "it's not that much worse than last year", etc.
Remedy: Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Invert the pattern and set up a drift toward high performance.

**Escalation**. Cycles of violence in conflicts between countries. Negative political ad campaigns that render both candidates unpalatable.
Remedy: disarmament. This can be unilateral or mutually agreed upon, but the latter requires mediation. 

**Success to the successful** is a common situation. The more money you have, the more of it you can make through investments, etc. 
Remedy: Jubilee? Potlatch? Antitrust laws? Estate taxes?

**Dependence**, including personal addiction, but many other things. Societal dependence on institutions like healthcare, etc. 
Remedy: focus on long-term restructuring rather than short-term relief.

**Rule beating**. Example: spending all available budget just to ensure that next years isn‚Äôt reduced. Example: only slowing down if there's a police car nearby.
Remedy: redesign the rules!

**Wrong goal**, a common situation where a system pursues a goal that does not actually reflect desired outcomes. Reminds a lot of [[McNamara Fallacy]]
Remedy: 

# Leverage points 

Most attributes of the system are effectively immutable. Structure of the flows is often physical. Delays are often unavoidable. Information flows in feedback systems are where most leverage lies.  

Unbridled growth with an amplifying loop is rare because such systems quickly lead to either:
- Exhaustion of resources (eg. No more bodies to infect)
- Balancing loop dominates (eg. Greater precautions and PPE)

**Slowing growth may bring stability to a system**. Reminds me of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1357764199015849984):

> For every hundred people telling us to "just install more solar panels", only one person will consider ways to reduce power usage.

**Make invisible information visible**. During the oil embargo in 1970, the Dutch began to pay attention to power consumption. Some houses mysteriously seemed to use 30% less power than others. The difference was in location of the power meter. Those with low power usage had meter in the lobby. Others had the meter in the basement.

**Re-write the rules**. Interventions into the system's rules are very effective. This explains why lobbyists are powerful. 

**Encourage self organization**: allowing a system to self organize is extremely powerful. But this may lead to unknown conclusions, so is not well loved by those in power. 

**Goals matter**. What is the ultimate goal of the system? What‚Äôs the goal of goog? What‚Äôs the priority order of many competing goals? Sometimes a leader can do this. Hitler profoundly changed the goals of Germany in the 1930s. Reagan changed the American ethos from ‚ÄúAsk not what your country can do for you ‚Äì ask what you can do for your country.‚Äù to ‚ÄúGovernment is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIf you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.‚Äù - St Exupery

**Paradigm shifts and meta paradigm awareness**. We live in a world with many unstated assumptions, hidden goals, biases. Changing these is the higest leverage point.

> There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‚ÄúMorning, boys. How‚Äôs the water?‚Äù And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is water?‚Äù


Sid Meier's Memoir!

MJ recommended I pick up this book. I regret nothing. 

This was a fun look into game development history, narrated by a venerable insider. I remember spending days with AK and MN playing Civ 1 in the mid-90s, and have played every game in the series since.

Billed as a memoir, this book focuses on anecdotes about the games and the game industry, with Sid Meier's personal life taking the backseat. I especially enjoyed the [Nuclear Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi) story. It's such a colorful intersection of a funny premise, computer science, and a hoax.

Sid Meier's taste for non-violent educational simulators is especially compelling, and reading about these games made me really miss them. As a kid, I think Civ sparked my interest in history and war and complex systems. But I was mainly just having a lot of fun! These days playing even one game of Civ is a heavy lift, but maybe it's worth giving Civ Revolutions a look? 

What I loved most about this book was how excited I became about building games again. The intersection of games and education is extremely tricky to pull off, and I would argue that edutainment as a genre has largely failed. The holy grail is to build something that plays like a game, but whets your appetite about something insightful. This is in some sense the opposite of what explorable explanations do, which are often more interactive visualizations than games.

> Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either - Marshal McLuhan

One thing the book lacked was specific learnings and insights into game development. The chapter on the failed dinosaur game came closest, but I would have loved a whole book on this. Here are some final notes:

**Follow your interests**: Sid Meier's games have been driven by his personal interests, at least in retrospect. 

**People hate randomness**: To placate people's busted sense of randomness and overdeveloped sense of fairness, Civ Revolutions had to implement some interesting decisions: any 3:1 battle in favor of human became a guaranteed win. Too many randomly bad outcomes in a row were mitigated.

**Feedback is fact**: If a player is frustrated, this is a fact. It's not just their opinion! If a game is not fun, this is a fact the developer needs to contend with.

**Interesting decisions**: Many of Meier's games rely heavily on decision making. The decisions must be interesting. 'I wonder what would happen next time, if I did it differently?'
