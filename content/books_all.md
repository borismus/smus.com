Great Work Of Time by John Crowley
===
rating: no

cover: /assets/book-covers/great-work-of-time.jpg

Thanks to AK for the suggestion, I found this to be a more historical and literary take on a concept similar to [End of Eternity by Isaac Asimov](/books/the-end-of-eternity-by-isaac-asimov/). It's also a short novella, which I think is part of why a lot of the details feel like they are left as an exercise to the reader.

Crowley's secret cabal of time traveling elites, takes after Asimov's Allwhen Council of Eternals. Except is founded by Cecil Rhodes and called the Otherhood. Just like Asimov's Eternals seek to intervene in time by making Minimal Necessary Changes for the Maximal Desired Response, the Otherhood seeks “the smallest possible intrusion that would have the proper effect”.

But unlike the Allwhen Council interested in preventing societal collapse, the Otherhood are Tories whose main goal is to keep the British empire going for as long as possible. In one future explored by Crowley, the Otherhood succeeds in this, preventing the calamities of the 20th century. A glimpse into the far future, however, reveals a dark and bizarre world with Hominids, Angels, and "Draconics". (Connecting the dots, this is supposed to be a terrible turn of events, but its apparent awfulness doesn’t really come through in the prose. What’s bad about it?)

Crowley goes beyond Asimov in describing the geometry of the multiverse which time travelers ("orthogonists") can traverse. Time marches on inexorably:

> The universe proceeds out of what has been and into what it will be, inexorably, unstoppably, at the rate of one second per second, one year per year, forever.

But as I understand it, any forward progress breeds a new universe that is literally orthogonal to the arrow of time:

> At right angles to its forward progress lie the past and the future. The future, that is to say, does not lie "ahead" of the present in the stream of time, but at a right angle to it

You can never enter the same present twice.

> The past he had passed through on his way back was not 'behind' his present at all, but at a right angle to it; the future of that past, which he had to traverse in order to get back again, was not the same road, and 'back' was not where he got.

(I think this is similar to the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) that quantum mechanics applies everywhere and at all times and so describes the whole universe. In particular, there is no wave function collapse. Schrödinger's cat is both alive and dead, even before the box is opened, but the "alive" and "dead" cats are in different branches of the multiverse, both of which are equally real, but which do not interact with each other.)

But how does time travel work in such a world? Well, I guess one possibility is that in the next time step, you move into a world that is a lot like the one before. With the many-worlds interpretation, it's possible that anything happens. So there's a non-zero probability of having a time machine and using it to time travel to a world that looks just like 1893. There is also a non-zero probability that you will use a chicken to time travel to a magical rainbow under the surface of Jupiter's smallest monkey. The only difference between these two scenarios is their respective probabilities.


Letters to my Palestinian Neighbor by Halevi
===
rating: yes
posted: Dec 7, 2023
cover: /assets/book-covers/letters-palestinian-neighbor.jpg

I discovered Yossi Klein Halevi following Hamas' massacre on Oct 7 on a podcast. Halevi's ability to combine a firmly pro-Israeli position with a gentle touch impressed me. This comes through in his book too, which I liked overall. I'll recommend it to left-leaning friends struggling to understand the situation.

# Interesting history
Half of Israeli Jews descend from the Arab diaspora. (I did some additional research at [[Waves of Jewish immigration (aliyah) into Israel]]). This is a pretty solid counter to the idea that Zionism is a European colonial project.

Hertzl's [Uganda Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Scheme) was new to me, or I'd forgotten the idea completely. Was this omitted from the brave and valiant history of Israel in my Hebrew school?

The 1975 UN resolution that "[Zionism is a form of racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379)" caused the hard Israeli right to harden. This "Zionism = racism" act was reverted in 1990 which increased Jewish and Israeli inclination to peace.

**Genocidal neighbors**: On one hand, you want to befriend your neighbors and let them into your house. On the other, when a genocidal enemy says that they want to destroy you, you should believe them. This is the dilemma that Israel faces with many Palestinians in Gaza. They are both neighbors and committed to the destruction of Israel.

**Arafat’s Johannesburg Speech**: In 1994, Yasser Arafat gave a speech in which he admitted that he wasn't actually looking for peace with Israel at all just a temporary seize fire.

> What they are saying is that [Jerusalem] is their capital. No, it is not their capital. It is our capital. It is the first shrine of the Islam and the Moslems

**Palestinian voice for peace?**: It's completely unclear where the serious voices advocating for a two state solution are in the Palestinian media. Where are they in the Arab world? Where are they in the broader Muslim world? (They seem to [exist](https://www.facebook.com/PalestinianVoiceforPeace/), but they are quiet.)

> No national movement has rejected as many offers to create a nation as the Palestinian national movement.

# Yossi's remedy

**Distinguish between country & land** Both the Israelis and the Palestinians make claims to the same land. But neither side can have full control over that land, so the only way the conflict can resolve peacefully is if there's some equilibrium in which the country of Israel is not the same as the land of Israel and the country of Palestine is not the same as the land of Palestine.

**Understand the imperfection**: Both sides must understand the imperfection of this equilibrium. This is just a compromise that needs to be reached while also acknowledging that both sides have a maximalist tendency to acquire all the land. This must be resisted in a credible way.

**Mutual contraction**: There is a mirroring here between the Palestinian right of return and the Israeli settlement movement:

- **Palestinian right of return**: Palestinians from Tel Aviv, Western Jerusalem, etc, want to return there. This is unprecedented — no other defeated nation would ever make such demands, and there's no way Israel would concede to them.
- **Israeli settlers movement**: Israelis that care about holy lands in Judea, Samaria, and in Arab cities like Hebron want to return there. This flies in the face of a two state solution and gives Palestinians proof that there is no credible partner for negotiation.

These maximalist claims need to be reneged in a mutual contraction. Israel contracts its settlements and Palestine contracts its refugee return demands.

**Cherry-pick the holy books**: There is so much in the scriptures, it’s a matter of picking the right narrative for the right time.

For example, from a religious Jewish perspective, it’s easy to see the territories as a literal commandment to capture the land of Israel and make it belong to the country. But also there are commandments about leaving the land fallow every 7 years and a bicentennial jubilee in which all debts and ownership is forgiven.


**Find common ground**: Despite the differences between Abraham and Ibrahim in the Torah and Quran respectively (e.g. [[Abraham vs. Ibrahim in the story of Sodom]]), there is a common ground:

- Abraham/Ibrahim smashed his father's idols.
- Ibrahim/Abraham was buried jointly by his sons Isaac and Ishmael, progenitors of proto-Judaism and proto-Islam.

**Religious surrender vs. intellectual inquiry**: Both Judaism and Islam have traditions of religious surrender and intellectual inquiry:

|                      | Judaism          | Islam              |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Religious surrender  | Binding of Isaac | Prayer mats        |
| Intellectual inquiry | Study houses     | Lost enlightenment |

Now in the 3rd millennium, Judaism lacks religious surrender, while Islam lacks intellectual inquiry. Both could use some work.

**On The Holocaust**: A common Arab take on the holocaust is: "it never happened, we're glad it did, and we're gonna do it again". Yossi describes a conciliatory trip to Auschwitz, undertaken by a mixed group of Israelis and Palestinians in which Arabs got to see the plight of the Jews due to the Nazis. (The people that need that trip the most are the people that would never go on such a trip.)

A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains as illusive as ever, and while no book will provide one, this one shed light on some historical details I did not know about. I hope that "Letters" might be even more illuminating to left leaning friends that feel less intrinsically connected to Israel than I do.


Tales from the Ant World by E. O. Wilson
===
rating: yes
posted: Nov 8, 2023
cover: /assets/book-covers/tales-ant-world.jpg

As a kid growing up in the Soviet Union, I remember eyeing a book called Пароль скрещенных антенн (literally "password of the crossed antennae") on my grandfather's bookshelf. It had a green leather home-made cover on it with just the title on it in block capital lettering. My grandfather bound it himself, as he did with many other books, from popular science books to books banned by the authorities. Grandma told me many stories about his obsession with books and bookbinding hobby which he took on after retirement. He would read everywhere: on the pot, at the dinner table, on the sofa. He always had a book on his person, which came in handy because Soviet life involved waiting in so many long queues, you could get a lot of reading done.

I still have the book, and it's on my to-read shelf, but for now, I opted for E. O. Wilson's most accessible take about ants to whet my appetite. "Tales from the Ant World" is a sort of popularization of his more famous "Ants", a Pulitzer prize winning textbook. This in itself is remarkable, but E. O. Wilson is also a pretty remarkable figure who I first learned about from his work on [consilience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience#Edward_O._Wilson). The writing in "Tales" is very personal, including many anecdotes from Wilson's life, and I think is geared to nudge younger readers towards myrmecology when they grow up. Perhaps less specifically, this book feels primed to maximize latent curiosity for budding scientists (it me?).

Overall it was well written and crazy interesting, a nice diversion from my usual topics. As it happens, I'm dealing with a minor ant infestation at home. There's something pleasantly escapist about peeling back a mundane aspect of our daily experience and discovering a whole world inside. It's equally real, but completely different.

### Reproduction

- The vast majority of useful ants (workers, soldiers, queens) are female.
- Males are "little more than flying sperm missiles", who after their nuptial flight, die or are driven away by their sisters
- Winged ant queens can be inseminated by multiple males and have provisions for storing male sperm for the duration of their whole lifetime, 10 to 15 years!
- A single queen is usually the mother of all the other ants in that colony.

### Pheromones

- Ants can "speak" with a limited vocabulary 10-20 chemical "words". For example, a scout can discover food and report it to her sisters via pheromones she leaves on the trail behind her.
- Each ant colony has its own unique smell, allowing ants to differentiate members of their own colony from intruders.
- Dead ants emit a certain pheromone, and when they do, their sisters bring them to the ant cemetery.
    - Wilson experimented by dabbing living ants with that pheromone and sure enough if dabbed, these ants are also carried to the cemetery despite their protestation! No ants were harmed in this particular experiment though. Subjects eventually wash themselves of it and return to normal ant life.

### Violence

- Ants are the dominant carnivores in their weight class.
- Many ants are cannibals, eating their dead and injured.
- Some species of ants can enslave other species of ants, and this is most commonly done by raiding another colony and stealing the larvae. These then grow up in the slaver nest and become pheromonically synchronized with their captors.
    - Wilson suggests this may be a good strategy of expanding worker ranks in a very difficult survival environment.

### Super-organisms?

- Fire ants have a fascinating survival tactic for flooding. They cling onto one another and create a living raft to float an entire colony back to shore (check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2ZysgGAABw)).
    - More accurately, it is a partially living raft given that many of the lower layers of ants will die of asphyxiation for their sisters.
- Leaf cutter ants are especially coherent and work as a single unit.
    - At which point are a collection of individuals better understood as a Super-organism?


The Burnout Society by Byung-Chul Han
===
rating: yes
posted: Oct 25, 2023
cover: /assets/book-covers/burnout-society.jpg

Some interesting ideas in this philosophical pamphlet, but they are atomized and not woven into a strong coherent argument. The book is not especially well written: rambling and repetitive and lacking structure. I'd recommend a shorter summary (hello, you're welcome) or listening to [Episode 188 of Philosophize This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm56nQ31kBk), which is what turned me onto Byung-Chul Han in the first place.

# Modernity suffers from too much positivity
Human societies operate like the immune system. Just like the immune system's goal is to determine which cells are part of the organism and which aren't, societies do the same at a higher level of organization. Societies historically are based on an identity. Some people are part of the in-group, and others are not.

If an immune system is not working properly, the organism becomes infected with disease. Similarly, as contemporary society shifts to be more inclusive, "otherness is being replaced with difference", and societies and individuals living in them lose their identity. Because of this shift, we live in a time that is "poor in negativity". And so, unlike the pathologies of yore that are borne from excess negativity, modernity suffers from too much positivity. I don't think Han takes this in a xenophobic direction, but I can definitely see the potential for this strain of thinking.

This rhymes a bit with toxic positivity, which errs too much on being outwardly positive, no matter how dire the circumstances. It also reminds me of modern censorship tactics (eg. [[Flood the zone with shit]]).

> The violence of positivity does not deprive, it saturates; it does not exclude, it exhausts.

Depression, ADHD, and burnout syndrome point to excess positivity:

> Today’s society is no longer Foucault’s disciplinary world of hospitals, madhouses, prisons, barracks, and factories. It has long been replaced by another regime, namely a society of fitness studios, office towers, banks, airports, shopping malls, and genetic laboratories.

People living in a society which glorifies the idea that nothing is impossible are likely to set unreasonable expectations for themselves. This leads to a downward spiral of disappointment, and ultimately depression.

> Also, its inhabitants are no longer “obedience-subjects” but “achievement-subjects.” They are entrepreneurs of themselves [...] Excess work and performance escalate into auto-exploitation. This is more efficient than allo-exploitation, for the feeling of freedom attends it. The exploiter is simultaneously the exploited. Perpetrator and victim can no longer be distinguished.

# Against multitasking
Han compares modernity's demands to multi-task with the state of nature, in which animals must divide its attention between many activities:

> That is why animals are incapable of contemplative immersion: either they are eating or they are copulating.

This state of being is incompatible with maintaining and creating culture, creative work, and mental health. Han criticizes Arendt's and Nietzsche's endorsement of the active life, instead favoring the contemplative life.

> Culture presumes an environment in which deep attention is possible. Increasingly, such immersive reflection is being displaced by an entirely different form of attention: hyperattention. A rash change of focus between different tasks, sources of information, and processes characterizes this scattered mode of awareness.

This reminds me a lot of a few books:

- [Creativity — Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](/books/creativity-by-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/)
- [Deep Work by Cal Newport](/books/deep-work-by-cal-newport/)
- And of course [HYPER-REALITY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs)


# Negative emotions can be good

- Too much positivity weakens feelings such as dread and mourning, which are important parts of the human experience.
- In Zen meditation, one attempts to free the mind of thoughts to "achieve the pure negativity of not-to".

Even rage can be good. Han writes that part of the problem of too much positivity is that we are losing the capacity for rage. Surprisingly, he interprets rage in a positive light. Perhaps there is something lost a bit in translation:

> Rage is the capacity to interrupt a given state and make a new state begin. Today it is yielding more and more to offense or annoyance [Ärgernis], “having a beef,” which proves incapable of effecting decisive change.

Defined this way, my mind goes to rage-quitting a job, which is less negative than say, road rage or a raging rampage. Indeed, when you notice negative emotions arise, that can be a catalyst for change.

# Two types of tiredness
Han suggests that there are two kinds of tiredness. I don’t want to be tired of you. I want to be tired with you.

1. "I-tiredness" is the tiredness of an exhausted ego. As in, I'm tired of you, a separating an isolating kind of fatigue.
2. "We-tiredness" after [Handke](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/874779) is a collective deep tiredness which brings wonder back into the world.

Han describes the difference in his usual cryptic style:

> The tiredness of exhaustion is the tiredness of positive potency. It makes one incapable of doing something. Tiredness that inspires is tiredness of negative potency, namely of not-to.

To Han, The Sabbath is a dedicated space-time for collective deep tiredness built into the Jewish week. This resonates with me and reminds me a lot of Heschel's ideas in [The Sabbath by Heschel](/books/the-sabbath-by-heschel/).

Han ties this I-tiredness to the war the achievement society individual wages on himself. He invokes a very short story by Kafka called Prometheus (see [[Kafka parables notes]]), in which “The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.” Han comments:

> As everyone knows, Prometheus also brought work to mankind when he gave mortals the gift of fire. Today’s achievement-subject deems itself free when in fact it is bound like Prometheus. The eagle that consumes an ever-regrowing liver can be interpreted as the subject’s alter ego. Viewed in this way, the relation between Prometheus and the eagle represents a relation of self-exploitation.

# Achievement society
In a somewhat wayward way, Han brings us to the main thesis of the book, which is that modern society is no longer a negative disciplinary society (thou shalt not X), but rather a positive, achievement society (you can be anything you want to be). He rehashes the same point many times over:

- Our society has eliminated the commanding Other in exchange for the self-starting entrepreneur.
- The late-modern achievement-subject [...] liberates itself into a project. However, the change from subject to project does not make power or violence disappear. Auto-compulsion, which presents itself as freedom, takes the place of allo-compulsion.
- Achievement society is the society of self-exploitation.
- The achievement-subject exploits itself until it burns out.
- The achievement-subject that understands itself as its own master, as homo liber, turns out to be homo sacer.
- The achievement-subject is simultaneously perpetrator and victim, master and slave. Freedom and violence now coincide.
- The project turns out to be a projectile that the achievement-subject is aiming at itself (haha — nice wordplay)

Han suggests that depression is caused by becoming “exhausted by his sovereignty”, tired from the constant need for initiative.

Han dunks on Freud and declares psychoanalysis obsolete. If I was more versed in psychoanalysis I might be more capable of understanding convoluted phrases like:

> It proves quite easy to withdraw the weakened libido from the Other and to use it to cathect new objects. There is no need for drawn-out, pain-filled “dream work.”

My assessment from the first read is "great ideas poorly assembled". Maybe it flows better in the original German?

This is How You Lose the Time War
===
rating: yes
posted: Oct 5, 2023
cover: /assets/book-covers/time-war.jpg

A stylistically beautiful novella reminiscent of [Invisible cities by Italo Calvino](/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino/). Written in an innovative format, this is more poetry than prose. "Time War" was certainly worth my time, but I could see how it may be annoying to some. At least it is mercifully short!

### Observations

- Well executed slow reveal (Burn Before Reading)
    - Multiverse composed of multiple forking strands and threads. They have names and numbers. Going "upthread" means back in time, "downthread" into the future.
- Beautiful quips like:
    - “adventure works in any strand. It calls to those who care more for living than for their lives”
    - "She climbs up thread and down. She braids and unbraids history’s hair"
- Ridiculously creative way of corresponding with one another. Letters are cleverly encoded in owl pellets (ha gross), seed sacks etc.
- Maybe this is deliberate, but who The Seeker is remains unclear. Is it the other agent? Or is it something else, planted by capital-C Chaos?
- If the world is a game, Blue and Red play a meta-game. But it feels like there is also a meta-meta game being played, which Blue and Red are only faintly aware of.

### Complaints

- Blue and Red are agents for two opposing "shifts", led by Garden and Commandant respectively, and representing broadly speaking Nature versus Technology.
    - Maybe this is somehow the point, but the two narrators/voices of the letters were indistinguishable.
- At some point the agents discover that they are madly in love with one another. But the letters are more clever than revelatory, and neither character arc well-defined.
    - Why did the agents actually fall in love? Pretty unclear.
- (On the other hand, the same kinds of complaints can be leveled at Calvino, and that would not be fair.)


### Associations

- Travel Light by Naomi Mitchison is lauded as "it's the same in all strands in which it exists"
- The classic Rolling Stones song [Sympathy for the Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwtyn-L-2gQ) came up for me multiple times while reading.

> And I was 'round when Jesus Christ<br>
> Had his moment of doubt and pain<br>
> Made damn sure that Pilate<br>
> Washed his hands and sealed his fate<br>
>
> Stuck around St. Petersburg<br>
> When I saw it was a time for a change<br>
> Killed Tsar and his ministers<br>
> Anastasia screamed in vain<br>

My skip-skip-skip level manager at work recommended it to all of his manager reports, and so I decided to read this book to get closer to the top brass. Overall it was a sobering read, actively reminding me how far my organization is from being customer-centric. The book mostly addresses product managers, but tries to also apply to leaders in general, and "product people" in particular. It's a bit unclear who these people are, but I suspect they include product-minded engineers and designers.

Things I liked:

- **Coach-as-manager**: Emphasis on coach-as-manager was interesting. "You can no longer be a good manager without being a good coach."
- **Build Right Thing**: The goal of a product manager is to ensure that the features being built by the product engineering team are the right features to be building.
- **Product Discovery**: The product development process is a process of discovery. It's like the product is already there, you just need to discover it, as opposed to inventing it from whole cloth.
- **PM's fault**: for a product to be successful, all cross-functional stakeholders have to have been successful. But if a product is not successful, it's the fault of the product manager.
- **Platform vs. experience**: Platform teams are not the same as experience teams and I strongly gravitate towards experience teams. The worst is when your experience team gets reorged to become a platform team.
- **Against the agency model**: The authors advocate strongly against the agency model, which encourages employees to behave like mercenaries rather than like missionaries.
- **Strategy means focus**:
- **Four big product risks**: ([[Four Big Product Risks]])
    1. Value: will they buy it?
    2. Usability: will they figure out how to use it?
    3. Feasibility: can we build it?
    4. Business viability: will it work for the business?

Things I did not like:

- Perpetuating Silicon Valley tropes:
    - Bill Campbell cult (reminds me of CB)
    - Favorite essay is "Software is Eating the World". How trite!
- Unclear how lessons from this book apply to completely new products like Smart Glasses. How we be customer-centric in a world where we have no customers?
- Authors seem overly optimistic about equity based compensation as a way to perfectly align incentives. At a company the size of Google, I don't think that sufficiently aligns individual actions. Might work better at a smaller company though!


Russian Revolutions by Mike Duncan
===
rating: yes
posted: July 20, 2023
cover: /assets/book-covers/revolutions-podcast.jpg

Mike Duncan covers a ton of ground on the events, people, and the necessary background to understand the Russian Revolution.

I appreciated the time spent on pre-revolutionary Russian history, and ideas and learned a lot about Russian anarchism. In particular, [[Bakunin's ideas of collectivist anarchism are appealing]], because [[Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely]].

One may balk at [[Kremlinology, Putinology, and now Prigozhinology]], but understanding the main players deeply is important, especially when events are contingent and individual actions can determine the fate of whole countries. Here too, Duncan does a good job providing more personal color than a dry history lecture might.

Feel free to read my working notes, or [listen to the podcast yourself](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/). What follows is an incomplete summary of themes I found novel and compelling.

<!--more-->

# A chain of embarrassing defeats lead up to the revolution

- Defeat in the Crimean war (1850s), embarrassingly shows how backwards Russia was, supposedly a military powerhouse.
- Defeat in Russo Japanese war (1905). Lost Port Arthur and the whole pacific fleet.
- Poor performance in WW1, which found Russia "grossly unprepared" and with far worst logistics than Germany, infighting, and distracted by lofty goals like taking Constantinople.

### Russia's Turkish ambitions

That's right, Russia had an explicit goal of taking the city of Constantinople away from the Ottomans. That would give Russians both the second and the third Rome! This was incredibly ambitious and in retrospect unrealistic. Despite Russia's sub-par performance in the war, some Russian leaders in the provisional government attempted to keep the conquest of Constantinople as one of Russia's military goals. Even as late as February 1917!

# Jewish matters

- Curious to see how important the Jewish Bund is to the whole revolution, both in the labor movement and Russian Revolution.
- The reactionary forces set in motion by the 1905 Russian Revolution mostly targeted Jews. Jews were very closely associated with Bolsheviks because most of the Bolshevik leaders were Jews. The internationalist orientation of the Bolshevik party, only helped antisemites confirm that Jews were foreign agents. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were a Russian invention, first printed in 1903.
- "Death to the Yids!" was as common as "Death to the Bolsheviks" during these times. This rhymes with the [[Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy]] used by Nazis to justify the Holocaust, which I first read about in [[Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder]].
- Yet leaders of all colors, red, white, and black constantly distanced themselves from the pogroms on the ground. They would condemn antisemitism in words only, without ever actually doing anything to stop it.

# Russia's early industrialization

Sergei Witte successfully led Russian railway modernization in the late 19th century. He argued that the tsarist regime could only be saved by transforming Russia into a modern industrial society. Some of his rapid industrial reforms were very successful and showed that Russia was well on its way to industrialization. This played well into the Marxist narrative that a first revolution was necessary for the socialist one that was to follow.

### Russia's archaic farming system
The "open-field system" was the prevalent agricultural system in Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Large fields, usually several hundred acres each, were divided into many narrow strips of land and doled out to peasants. A lucky family might own several independent strips in different regions, which was very inefficient.

Because Russia freed the serfs only in the mid-19th century, this system remained in place far longer than in other European countries. And it wasn't until Stolypin's reforms in 1905 that the system began to slowly phase out.

- [[Medieval farm plots were long and thin because oxen couldn't turn]]

### Western-backed industrialization
After the revolution and during the 1920s, the Great Depression in the West reduced popular confidence in capitalism. Thus, western investors turned to the Soviet Union whose brave new economic model was not yet discredited. Its economy was shaky at the moment, but had a bright future ahead.

> Impressive growth rates during the first three five-year plans (1928–1940) are particularly notable given that this period is nearly congruent with the Great Depression. During this period, the Soviet Union saw rapid industrial growth while other regions were suffering from crisis. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union))

[The Soviet Problem with Two "Unknowns": How an American Architect and a Soviet Negotiator Jump-Started the Industrialization of Russia](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41933723) was a worthwhile paper I read on this subject a few years ago.


# Russia was never democratic
Wow, the color of the political climate between 1905 and 1917 makes me really reconsider the position that Russia had this period of democracy between 1905 and 1917. Something like 2000 people were murdered by the state as part of punitive actions conducted by the tsar following the revolution of 1905. The first Duma Congress was not real democracy, by any stretch of the imagination, and multiple Dumas were created and dismantled by the tsar.

So the actual precedent of liberals in power in Russian history is very small, possibly just Gorbachev and Yeltsin?

- [[Russia has never been liberal, democratic, or free]]


# WW1: Europe's workers chose war over solidarity
Fascinating (socialist) perspective: on the dawn of WW1, the workers were at a cross road between two choices:

1. Join together for an international communist revolution, or
2. Kill each other at scale in the battlefield in the name of their respective nations.

Ultimately they chose (2). Why? International socialists ultimately embraced their national identities rather than the globalist agenda:

- By 1914 the socialist parties had been well integrated into the parliaments and could influence the government directly. They now had a lot to lose.
- Being against the war meant that opposing parties could accuse the socialists of being unpatriotic.

# Marx's prophecy of two revolutions
Lenin and other Bolsheviks took Marx at his word, and thought Russia needed to undergo two revolutions. The first one to become more capitalist and industrialized to bring Russia into a state resembling the western society Marx imagined would be fertile ground for extreme inequality and worker immiseration. Then another socialist revolution would then actually bring forth socialism.

Luckily Russia was on track, and the Bolsheviks watched and waited in exile as the first revolution went swimmingly in 1905. Here are some proximate causes of the Revolution of 1905:

- Terrible performance in Russo Japanese war. Lost Port Arthur and the whole pacific fleet.
- Worker strikes in at Petersburg and general support from workers and the Intelligentsia.
- Bloody Sunday illustrated the tsar true colors and awarded him the nickname Bloody Nicholas.

# Women began the February 1917 revolution
In 1916, women spent forty hours a week in bread lines. And ultimately the radicalized women galvanized the February 1917 revolution during International Women's Day. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day#Early_development_in_the_USSR_and_other_communist_nations):

> On March 8, 1917, in Petrograd (February 23, 1917, on the Julian calendar), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding "Bread and Peace"—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to czarism. This marked the beginning of the February Revolution, which alongside the October Revolution, made up the second Russian Revolution

[[There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy]]. Of course, there were also other causes for the February 1917 revolution:

1. Millions of casualties in an entrenched war with front lines stabilizing but still a dismal situation.
2. Massive inflation due to funding the war effort leading to unaffordable living.
3. Lack of food and goods due to supply chain disruptions from prioritizing war efforts.
4. An unusually cold winter in 1917, leading to general misery.
5. A tsar that refused to do anything in response to a chorus of voices warning him of the dire path he is on.

Still, International Women's Day was the catalyzing event.

# The hemophiliac grandmother of Europe
Tsarevich Alexei, son of Nikolai II had hemophilia (non-clotting blood), a debilitating disease inherited from Queen Victoria I, known as the “grandmother of Europe” because of how many rulers were descended from her blood. Nicholas and Alexandra sought out a healer in hopes of curing their son and heir of Russia. And that is how Rasputin got an initial foothold in the Russian palace, coming recommended as a holy man and miracle healer.

Rasputin ended up being emblematic of the magical thinking so common in the last tsar's surroundings.

# Defeatism and defencism
Defencists hoped Russia would win World War 1 outright. But there was also an internationalist (less charitably, defeatist) camp which hoped that Russia would lose. Lenin was more aligned with the latter, although his views are characterized as “flexible” despite bombastic delivery.

The Bolshevik membership dwindled during the war years because of their defeatist position. Because they wanted Russia to end the war and lose, they were easily painted as being extremely unpatriotic and equivalent to German agents. Lenin's flexibility allowed this to almost come true:

### Lenin's German-backed voyage from Switzerland to Petrograd
The story of how Lenin got back from Switzerland to Russia on the eve of the February 1917 revolution is completely fascinating. The Germans learned that they may have a great asset in the revolutionary-in-exile, who at the time was living in Zurich. Lenin and a tight group of collaborators colluded with the Germans to orchestrate his return to St. Petersburg. They planned a clandestine operation, taking a circuitous route, and sneakily traveling in closed railway cars. The whole trip sounds like a great adventure. Surely there are books and movies written about it?

# Lenin's role and historical contingency
During the "July Days", the revolutionaries themselves had to talk radicalized people down from pursuing a socialist revolution because they felt like they weren't quite ready for the events that might unfold. And if the provisional government managed to retain power after such an attempt, it would be bad news for future revolutionary prospects.

But Lenin was extremely passionate about decisive action, and managed to eventually convince the rest of the Bolsheviks. What would have happened without his drive, if the October Revolution did not play out?

Fanny Kaplan attempted to kill Lenin and almost did in 1919:

> One bullet passed through Lenin's coat, and the other two struck him. One passed through his neck, punctured part of his left lung, and stopped near his right collarbone; the other lodged in his left shoulder

What would have happened if she succeeded?

# Duma ➡ Soviets ➡ Communists
After Nicholas' abdication, Russia was governed by "Dual Power". Under this scheme the country was ruled partly by the Provisional Government (Duma) and partly the people directly via bottom-up Soviets. The Soviet system emerged from the St. Petersburg Soviet and when they declared that they will be the Soviet of All of Russia, which eventually morphed into the Soviet Union.

The slogan "All power to the Soviets" now makes more sense in this context of the parallel tracks of a provisional government and of soviets sharing power.

Lenin sensed that this dual power system was unstable and helped quash the provisional government. Then his Bolsheviks had a unified agenda and successfully ["bolshevized" the soviets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevization_of_the_Soviets).

The Russian Communist Party is just a rebranding of the Bolshevik party and retains full continuity. The split between Communists and Socialists might mirror the differences of opinion between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Why is the political left so often infighting?

The new Communist government was recognized as by many of the international powers as part of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, hastily signed by the triumphant Communists after the October 1917 revolution on March 3, 1918. The treaty was terrible for the sovereignty of Russia because it lost so many territories. This was a serious gambit on the part of the Bolsheviks, an astounding move because of how much territory was ceded. But this did not last, as the treaty was annulled by the armistice of November 11, 1918.


# Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Kerensky, leader of the provisional government in 1917 assumed more and more power until eventually he took up residence in the winter palace. Flags were raised when he was at home, as was the custom of the old order. He slept in the bed of the tsar. Kerensky believed he was the right leader for Russia. By September 1917 he had effectively cultivated a dictatorship. Didn’t last long though.

Kerensky lost touch and feared a counter revolution from the right. Through a series of miscommunication Kerensky became convinced that Kornilov was planning a right wing coup and empowered the Bolsheviks to defend the counter revolution (see
[[Defense is much more palatable than offense]]). This gave the Bolsheviks a second life, because at this point most were held in prison and convinced they were about to be executed.

It’s funny that the Soviets by 1919 had become quite corrupt and society was extremely unequal. Just as expected from a new elite that suddenly discovers an inordinate amount of power. This is interesting especially in contrast with the extremely austere and ideological stance of the communists just a year before.

Now this inequality meant that communist party began to attract careerists and those seeking comfort, a completely different group than ideologically driven revolutionaries. And the cycle is complete.


# Russians are a passive and nihilistic population
Most Russians were neutral during the October Revolution. Few participated in the Bolshevik ideology, and few came to the defense of the provisional government.

This neutrality is deep-seated in the Russian soul. My theory is that this skeptical nihilistic stance stems from a lack of civic society. I strongly suspect that this lack of civil society is keeping Russia back politically, and that elites actively foment this stance in the population.

- [[Russia's strategy is sowing cynicism]]
- [[Civil society is an antidote to autocracy]]

# Reds, whites, blacks, and other colors
Despite the reactionary white's military success in Ukraine, they were universally hated by the local population. The Cossack division of the white army served as mounted shock troopers, raiding Ukrainian cities to such an extent that they were completely distrusted. The communist reds were not much better, but committed fewer outright atrocities. The people chose them as the lesser of two evils.

### Lineage of the anarchist blacks
Nestor Makhno was a Ukrainian anarchist and framed as an anti-anti-Semite by Duncan. Both of those these things are interesting, and I looked more into him as a person including a grotesque depiction in an old Soviet film, and read a few articles. Quite the character.

 Makhno found under the black flag, the classic anarchist symbol. He temporarily allied with the communist Reds, but only to join forces against the Whites. After repelling the White forces, the Blacks and Reds did not have enough common ground. According to a prominent anarchist Peter Arshinov,

 > The basic psychological trait of Bolshevism is the realization of its will by means of the violent elimination of all other wills, the absolute destruction of all individuality, to the point where it becomes an inanimate object.

Such opinions were not tolerated by the Communists, and Makhno ultimately fled to Paris.

- [[Bakunin's ideas of collectivist anarchism are appealing]]

### Other color armies
The Polish [Blue Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Army_(Poland)) was so named for French-issued blue military uniforms worn by the soldiers. There were also [Green Armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_armies) during the same period of the Russian Civil War.

Using colors as names for armies feels especially out of place when millions of people are being displaced and dying.

# Russian chauvinism against Ukraine and visible minorities
The Whites completely denied Ukraine's existence, instead calling it "Little Russia" (Малороссия). They completely ignored Ukrainian autonomy and national statehood, and appointed just ethnic Russians as governors for the region.

Before the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, propagandists used really disgusting overtly racist hatred of the Japanese people.

This xenophobia echoes Putin's ongoing war in Ukraine. Firstly, the dismissal of Ukrainian legitimacy is central to the whole endeavor. Secondly, visible minorities like the Buryats are much more likely to die in Ukraine because they are used as cannon fodder.

# Western-backed anti-Russian forces
The White counter-revolution managed to make significant gains largely supported by the British.

There is a historical pattern emerging here from the perspective of Russia, or at least Russian propagandists. In the Russian Civil War, the Polish-Soviet War and the current Russo-Ukrainian war, allied western powers create a puppet entity, whether it's the White Army or the Polish State or the Ukrainian State, to wage war against Russia's historical integral territory. The Russians are of course on the defense in this framing, fighting for their survival. (See [[Defense is much more palatable than offense]])

In the civil war, people on the front were not motivated to fight for the idea of communism. Instead, the rallying cry in the civil war, in Soviet-Polish war and in general focused on preserving the integrity of Russia itself. The same was true during World War II, which was framed as the great patriotic war by Stalin to appeal not to ideology or way of life, but to the powerful force of Russian nationalism.

Why did Lloyd George change his mind on regime change in Russia? Initially he was extremely anti-Bolshevik, but it seems like he lost steam over time. In 1921, at the insistence of Great Britain, the Allies ended the Russian military intervention and gave up on the blockade. Are we on track for same change of heart in the Russian War on Ukraine now in 2023?

# Western relief for Russian famines
During the terrible famines in the 1920s I didn't realize how much humanitarian aid the Soviets were receiving. Twice as many people would have died if not for the external help. The most impactful and generous was the [Russian Famine Relief Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Famine_Relief_Act) funded by the American Relief Administration (ARA), which gave $2B USD (2023) to the effort, until Lenin began to export grain in 1923.


# Lenin sowed the seeds for Stalin
Lenin's cruelty is often overshadowed by his famously vile successor, but Stalin was largely building on top of the foundation that Lenin had set during his tenure.

Grossman makes a similar argument in ([[Все Течёт (Everything Flows by Vasily Grossman)]]), saying that more than any of Lenin's other potential successors, Stalin best captured the essence of his soul: thirst for power.

> Who, asks Grossman rhetorically, should be Lenin's successor? Would it be the brilliant, turbulent, magnificent Trostky? The charming, gifted political theorist Bukharin? Perhaps the one closest to the workers Rykov? Maybe the well-educated, confident, and sophisticated governor Kamenev? Last but not least, the one best versed in international labor, Zinovyev?


### Lenin and the Bolsheviks were flexible and not bound to morals
One of the minor Bolsheviks named Bauman had an affair with another revolutionary, who became pregnant. Bauman responded by mocking her and circulating vicious cartoons. The woman later hanged herself. Most members of the party wanted Bauman expelled for this misconduct but not Lenin, citing that he was a good agent. Personal ethics was nothing to Lenin.

Early Bolsheviks would routinely participate in so-called expropriations. This was just a fancy term for stealing from the rich. The [1907 Tiflis bank robbery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_Tiflis_bank_robbery) in particular was especially impressive and bloody, killing 40 and injuring 50. It was planned mainly by Stalin (aka Koba) and Ter-Petrosian (aka Kamo), but also involved Lenin.

Initially imagined as a multiparty system centered around the soviets, Left SRs were well represented alongside the Bolsheviks. Their presence gave the Bolsheviks plausible deniability to claim they weren’t authoritarian at all, and were just facilitating a democratic system. The left SR rebellion in 1918 changed that. They were opposed to Brest-Litovsk and wanted to usher in international communism. They were brutally repressed by Lenin in the [Trial of the SRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_the_Socialist_Revolutionaries), which paved the way for Stalinist show trials in the era that followed.

I was surprised at how early the [Soviet ban on Factions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_on_factions_in_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) began. Because it was rolled out in 1921, it's almost a foundational idea to the whole Soviet project. Fundamentally illiberal, it was effectively a ban on freedom of assembly and served to strengthen the Communist Party, by weakening the bottom-up soviets.

Lenin's own big personality is largely at fault for the Communist party's oligarchy, which tended towards autocracy. On the other hand, other Russia-specific trends point to something deeper. The tsars and the mongols that preceded presided over societies dominated by small cliques or individuals (Genghis Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great). Stalin and Lenin were just links in the same chain.

The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler

What if a book review could be composed entirely of "what if?" questions?

**Speculative cephalopods**: What if octopuses developed a communication system, exapted from their ability to create clouds to escape from predators? What if it was like visual speech, ephemeral as an ink cloud?

**Climate pressure as a catalyst for cephalopod intelligence**: What if cephalopods experienced survival pressure from human induced climate change, which caused them to become extremely intelligent? What if it was analogous to early humans who were forced into resourceful survival by the coming of an ice age?

**Social learning**: What if deep sea octopuses with a longer natural lifespan adapted to shallower depths and changed their breeding practices to overlap with their offspring, raising them and passing on their language and wisdom?

**Human machine labor**: What if human labor ends up being cheaper than machine labor, and a wave of automation that once replaced human workers with robots runs in reverse because it turns out that a crew of human slaves is cheaper to maintain than a crew of marine robots?

(This reminds me of the low cost of human slave labor in Roman times. Why bother improving on simple water wheels if slaves are ubiquitous? [[Increasing costs of human labor and mechanization]])

**Tricking super-human intelligence:** What if even in the far future, an advanced AI could be outwitted by a mere human to make a fatal mistake, just like Bing's ChatGPT could be outwitted to reveal its creepy secret identity, Sydney?

**Praying to super-human intelligence**: What if the power imbalance between AIs and humans becomes so great that people will begin praying to AIs in the same way that a Christian might pray hoping The Lord hears her and grants her wish, except the AI can actually hear it and grant it?

**Musings on consciousness**: What if "what is it like to be a Bat" is too hopelessly difficult to answer, and we should instead be focusing on "what is it like to be another person", which involves more empathy and theory-of-mind than most people can ever muster?

**Automonks**: What if religious ceremonies could be performed by automata, and would that somehow diminish their effects on the deities that they are aimed to please?

**Contemplative robotics**: What if zen-inspired contemplative Buddhist traditions could be harnessed to create biologically inspired, nature-compatible robots that are far superior to those descending from the higher modernist western tradition?

**Memory and forgetting**: What if there was a conscious being that never forgets, and could it really have a human-like intelligence with perfect memory, while still retaining the ability to grow and change over time?

**Embodied cognition:** What if most of an intelligent being's intelligence was located not in some centralized brain, but decentralized in its extremities, and what would the implications of that be?

**Underwater control**: What if a human submerged underwater attached to a breathing apparatus could use their arms and legs to control more devices, like an army of semi-autonomous drones?

**Computerized therapy companions**: What if a common prescription for loneliness and some mental health problems is to talk to a sophisticated virtual friend designed to be the perfect companion that discretely also administers a CBT program? What if this extends to virtual romantic partners? What if people delude themselves into thinking their virtual companions are real?

## Meta observations

I am once again reminded that good speculative fiction is often a more powerful medium for conveying information than popular science (see [[Power of Fiction]]).

The names of the characters were out of this world: Evrim, Rustem, Altantsetseg, Arnkatla Mínervudóttir-Chan. I enjoyed the somewhat exotic Central Asian settings where the events took place.

The quotes are at the start of the chapters are excepted from books authored by two main protagonists, *How Oceans Think* by Dr. Ha Hguyen, and *Building Minds* by Arnkatla Mínervudóttir-Chan. These quotes both contribute to character development and sprinkle in abstract wisdom. I really wish that "How Oceans Think" was a real book. I'd read it in a heartbeat.

Although Nayler doesn't quite tie up all loose threads, the threads compliment one another in a way that I found pretty compelling.

## Synthesis with other mediums

Nosferatu is apparently a reference to Dracula and the corresponding [eponymous silent movie Nosferatu from 1922](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC6jFoYm3xs&t=3051s).

The character Rustem's internet alias is Bakunin, a reference to the most famous Russian anarchist prominently featured in the [Russian Revolutions Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revolutions/id703889772). I'm digesting this magnum-podcast in parallel, review/summary forthcoming.

Nayler draws analogies between octopuses and fictional drone army operators (Altantsetseg) in their reliance on autonomous leaf-nodes, whether they are limbs or drones. Similarly, Sun Tzu and John Boyd [recommend](/books/boyd-by-robert-coram/) giving subordinates loose orders but empowering with almost complete autonomy.

> “A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.” – Frederik Pohl

By Pohl's metric, The Mountain in The Sea is great science fiction. I enjoyed the book thoroughly, major thanks to Captain A for the recommendation.


Boyd by Robert Coram
===
rating: yes
posted: Jun 2, 2023
cover: /assets/book-covers/boyd.jpg

I've heard a lot about Boyd in various FLUX-adjacent circles. His ideas seem to have reached a critical mass, in which they are widely known in the business world, having matriculated there from their origin in the military. I enjoyed this account of Boyd's larger than life legacy. Boyd is vividly depicted as a complex, brilliant, funny, and flawed character. He made great contributions to organizational dynamics, but was abrasive and broadly disliked. He was a great mentor to his followers, but an uncaring and absent father.

Boyd seemed to combine two incongruous personas. On one hand, he was a "big jock", a boastful fighter pilot who was constantly in your face. In retrospect, Top Gun does a good job of conveying some of this fighter pilot machismo. On the other, he was a history nerd, and read widely on war and philosophy.

There's a lot to digest in this book, and I've tried to categorize the things I've learned (TIL!) into a few categories:

# Organizational analogies to Google

**Military performance reviews** parallel my experience at Google. Except, their performance reviews are called ERs and peer reviews are called "indorsements". Similar to Google, positive indorsements from Generals (I guess L8+ Directors) are weighted heavily and are reason for promotion.

I was most interested in the author's insights on the dynamics of the military.

Boyd had an interesting pattern of ERs:

> As had happened again and again in Boyd’s career, his immediate supervisor gave him a poor or mediocre rating, one that signaled it was time to get out of the Air Force, and again and again a general officer rescued him.

**Politics between branches of the Military**. Just like at Google, where different "orgs" are often less than friendly towards one another, the military has significant rivalries between branches:

> THE Air Force has never made a serious study of warfare because every historically based effort to do so has come to the inescapable conclusion that the use of air power should be consistent with or—better yet— subordinate to the ground commander’s battle plans, a conclusion that argues against the existence of an independent Air Force.

Indeed,

> Nothing galvanized an Air Force general more than being told the Navy was on his six.

Boyd's impact on the Air Force peaked with E-M theory, and his intellectual contributions did not really stick. They had a much warmer reception with the Army and especially with the Marine Corps, a warrior culture with utter contempt for the Air Force technocrats.

**Military briefs** seem to be a very specific kind of medium. This is a fascinating digression in itself:

> The briefer has a pointer, which he should not use too often. He stands on a stage but should not move about too much. He has a lectern upon which he should not lean. He has slides or charts but is expected to know the material far beyond what is displayed.

It's also interesting how some of the culture parallels some aspects of culture at Google, perhaps analogous to pitching a project to a director or senior PM:

> It is obvious that most people can read and assimilate information faster than they can learn something by listening to a dog and pony show. But the U.S. military culture is an oral culture and the bedrock of that culture is the briefing.


**Franklin Roosevelt theory of management**, bypassing sycophantic generals and seeking out from among relatively junior officers a few men who would tell him the truth. (See [[Franklin Roosevelt theory of management]]).

**Corruption in the Pentagon**. The real business of the Pentagon is buying weapons, which is a very idiosyncratic process. One big problem Spinney (one of Boyd's acolytes) identified was that defense contractors routinely underestimate costs so that Congress funds their programs. This is called front-loading.

Another issue has to do with the "revolving door" that shuffles former military officers into high-level jobs as defense contractors, just as the door pulls former hired guns into government careers.

**Leaders are opposed to free play**. To hone skills around OODA, Boyd set up exercises which were "immensely popular with most junior officers and just as unpopular with most senior officers." because

> Free play means winners and losers; it means postexercise critiques by enlisted men as well as junior officers. No battalion commander enjoys being contradicted by a sergeant, especially if the sergeant is correct. And if a battalion commander loses a free-play exercise, he might lose his chance at promotion.

This is exactly the problem with prediction markets (see [[Prediction markets do not align with what leaders want]]).

# Fighter pilot culture

**A shocking number of pilots died training at Nellis**, training to be fighter pilots. Incoming F-86 students were told, “If you see the flag at full staff, take a picture.” Boyd says that in one year, more than seventy pilots were killed. A historian at Nellis says he probably was conservative—that wing commanders sometimes doctored statistics if too many pilots died.

> When a pilot augered in, screwed the pooch, fucked the duck, and bought the farm, then the base siren wailed and the blue car drove slowly and wives stood in the windows and the chaplain consoled and the flag hung at half staff.

This was a temporary trend, and safety was becoming paramount in the Air Force.

> Dogfighting was becoming an arcane and almost lost art in the Air Force.

**Cool fighter pilot slang**
- To "get on someone's six" is to be directly behind them.
- To "have someone in your pipper" means to be missile-locked onto another fighter plane.
- To "pull high G's" means to climb or bank abruptly, creating a lot of acceleration.
- "Guns. Guns. Guns." is what you say when you have someone in your pipper as if shooting them in a training exercise.
- A variable-geometry wing, commonly called the “swing wing.”

**Fast transients** are fighter pilot maneuvers like "flat-plating the bird." and the "buttonhook turn" and "energy dumping" were strongly preferred by the Fighter Mafia, describing planes like the YF-16 that could perform them as "shit hot".

> He would be in the defensive position with a challenger tight on his tail, both pulling heavy Gs, when he would suddenly pull the stick full aft, brace his elbows on either side of the cockpit, so the stick would not move laterally, and stomp the rudder. It was as if a manhole cover were sailing through the air and then suddenly flipped 90 degrees. The underside of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer became a speed brake that slowed the Hun from 400 knots to 150 knots in seconds. The pursuing pilot was thrown forward and now Boyd was on his tail radioing "Guns. Guns. Guns."

This "energy dumping" or [Cobra maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_maneuver) used to be prohibitively expensive, but became common for lightweight fighters.

More complicated maneuvers like the [button-hook turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf1cRPs8CQo) also became possible. Even crazier, [Kvochur's Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailslide) or "tail sliding" became possible.

TIL there's a whole diagramming language of aerial maneuvers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aresti_Catalog.

**Many fighter pilots are short** to fit into a tight cockpit of the plane. Tom Cruise comes to mind... :)

**IDF Cameo** involving Mordecai Hod, head of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), who reified the idea that aircraft guns make a lot of sense. In the Six Day War of June, the Israeli Air Force shot down sixty Arab jets while losing only ten fighters—an exchange ratio of six to one. Every Israeli kill was a gun kill. At the end of Hod's briefing,

> a fighter pilot stood up and asked how the IAF got sixty gun kills. Hod paused, shrugged, and said, “Why waste a missile on an Arab?”

**Fighters vs. bombers vs. test pilot culture**. Bombers were in favor, with the military retooling for nuclear bombs because they believed that the next war would be nuclear.

Meanwhile, fighter pilots were the obsolete cowboys, but they had the fun job.

> SAC’s bomber pilots might be the glamour boys. But to a fighter pilot, flying a B-47 or a B-52 was the aviation equivalent of being a bus driver.

Test pilots were another breed,

> detached from the airplane they flew. Fighter pilots fell in love with their airplane. Test pilots talked of going into space. Space? And in a capsule? You don’t fly a fucking capsule, you sit in it and watch the instruments. You’re a passenger. To hell with space. Fighter pilots wanted to get on an enemy’s six and hose the sonofabitch.

# Fighter pilot design
**Energy–maneuverability theory** is one of Boyd's first intellectual contributions. Fundamentally, it's a tool for fighter pilots to intuit the rate of change of energy available to the aircraft. For example, If I am at 30,000 feet and 450 knots and pull six Gs, how fast am I gaining or losing energy? Can my adversary gain or lose energy faster than I can?

The theory eventually became accepted in the Air Force and was instrumental in designing the F-16.


**Guns or missiles?** The Air Force was inherently technology obsessed, and rushed to embrace any new technology. This led to over eager adoption of missiles before they could lock very well. It also led to fighter planes that were crippled by having too many features in them (feature creep!)

> The Air Force was only seven years old, but it was fast becoming not only a bureaucracy, but a technocracy that worshiped equipment and gadgets more than any other branch of the military. It was becoming hardware oriented and the goals for its hardware were simple: Bigger-Faster-Higher-Farther.

In particular, many generals mistakenly thought that "if an American pilot saw a blip on his radar, he pressed a button, launched a missile, and the blip disappeared. Poof! It was that simple.", but E-M data and computer simulations proved that reality was far different. And pilots knew it too:

> Sparrow missiles performed so poorly they were considered little more than extra weight; more than one pilot punched them off his aircraft as soon as he was away from his home base.

> Signs began showing up on the walls in the Pentagon: “It takes a fighter with a gun to kill a MiG-21.”

**Swing-wing were too heavy** and did not justify the benefits that they purported to provide. A straight wing is most efficient for low-speed flight, but swept wings are superior for supersonic speeds. However, this design became obsolete by the 1970s, and Boyd foresaw it.

> During the summer of 1967, the Soviets introduced two new fighters: the swing-wing MiG-23 and the MiG-25. American fighter pilots laughed at the MiG-23 and said the only good thing about the F-111 was that the Soviets had copied it and thereby lost at least one generation of aircraft to bad technology.

**F-111 design had too many miracles**

When Boyd was coming up in his career, he predicted that the F-111 would be a failure.

> Prudent designers usually make significant technological advances in only one of the three categories when they plan a new aircraft. But the F-111 was a high-tech wonder with two bold innovations, both of which were later to cause enormous problems.

Boyd knew that, left to its own devices, the bureaucracy always came up with an aircraft such as the F-111.

[[Startups should have exactly one miracle]]

Ultimately, Boyd was proven right when the disastrous results of Vietnam became well known. During the Korean War, the US boasted a 10-to-1 kill ratio, but in Vietnam, the ratio sank close to parity, at one point favoring the North Vietnamese.

> When the war finally ended, one Air Force pilot would be an ace. North Vietnam would have sixteen.


**F-X was designed with maneuvering specifications**, the first plane in the US Air Force designed with dogfighting in mind.

> The closest Boyd came to defining a specific technical solution was when he said the aircraft should pull enough Gs at 30,000 feet to “roll down your goddamn socks.”

**Design by committee sucks**. The design process of all projects Boyd was involved in was a huge struggle since it was designed by committee, and the plane became a huge kitchen sink.

> ...Boyd worked daily to remove things from the F-X, seemingly everyone else in the Air Force—the fire-control people, missile people, electronic-warfare people—wanted to add something. Maintenance people even insisted the aircraft carry a built-in maintenance ladder

Ultimately, Boyd lost many design battles:

> The Air Force insisted on a speed greater than Mach 2. The Air Force insisted on a radar with a thirty-six-inch dome—a requirement that dictated a much larger fuselage than Boyd wanted.

This scope creep is a massive problem for products at Google too. Boyd was part of a ragtag team that tried to develop an alternative prototype:

> Night after night they labored at the Pentagon, drawing plans for an airplane they called the “Red Bird,” a 33,000-pound stripped-down version of the F-X.

But it was never brought into production, since

> all the three-stars who worked for [the Chief of Staff] wanted the bigger and heavier version of the F-X

Which was a huge blow to Boyd's ego:

> He had cut some weight, and yes, he had killed the variable-sweep wing. But it had taken just about everything out of him to fight and fight and fight for so much that was so obvious.

Perhaps this disempowerment is just a feature of working for a large bureaucratic organization.

**Tropospheric discontinuity** is an interesting phenomenon (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause)), explaining why it is meaningful to talk about discrete parts of the atmosphere. The speed of sound at sea level is ~340 m/s, and decreases as the temperature decreases until reaching ~10 km altitude, where it drops to 300 m/s. This part of the atmosphere is called the tropopause, the boundary that marks the troposphere from the stratosphere. Higher than that, temperature and the speed of sound decrease at a much slower rate than in the troposphere.

# Boyd the person
Coram spends quite a bit of time pontificating on Boyd's personal life, which was often in a state of disrepair.

**Boyd sayings**
- “Stroking the bishop. You’re just stroking the bishop.”
- “I have found the dripping cock.” Secretaries wept at Boyd’s language. (Instead of "smoking gun")
- It is said that Air Force careerists—“Blue Suiters”—would put on track shoes and climb up the backs of their mothers for [appealing] assignments.
- “It’s too goddamn big, too goddamn expensive, too goddamn underpowered. It’s just not worth a good goddamn.”
- “We don’t care what the Russians are doing. We only care about what the Navy is doing.”
- Boyd asked “How did you get this data on the wing design?” The vice president charged off the cliff. “Wind-tunnel tests,” he said. “Fuck a wind tunnel,” Boyd roared. He pointed up. “The biggest wind tunnel in the world is up there. It’s called reality. This is not reality.”
- “Goddamn airplane is made out of balonium.”
- Boyd's “air-to-rug maneuver,” happened once, where his phone call with a Blue Suiter caused him to fall out of his chair.
- “If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty.”
- “There are only so many ulcers in the world and it is your job to see that other people get them.”
- “Machines don’t fight wars, people do, and they use their minds.”
- “People, ideas, hardware—in that order.”
- “They still believe in high diddle diddle, straight up the middle.”
- “So you got your reward; you got kicked in the teeth. That means you were doing good work. Getting kicked in the teeth is the reward for good work.”

**Boyd's "Acolytes"** all subscribed to the "do something" idea, were not career oriented. They were "extraordinarily bright, all have an almost messianic desire to make a contribution to the world in which they live, all are men of probity and rectitude, and all—while independent in the extreme"

Many of these people were long-term collaborators from all over the military. Notably Thomas Christie, Pierre Sprey, Everest Riccioni, and others also formed a controversial ad-hoc group jokingly called the **Fighter Mafia** (a rejoinder to the [Bomber Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_Mafia)) and strongly advocated for a lightweight fighter pilot.

Christie the Finagler, Sprey the Intelligent, Leopold the First, Spinney the Brash, and Burton the Unbending.

**Boyd the Legend** Separating legend from truth was an ongoing challenge for me while reading the book, especially considering that

> deep in the bone marrow of a fighter pilot—exaggeration and the belief that a good story is more important than sticking with the bare facts.

**Incapable of compromise**. The author speculates that had Boyd been promoted, he would have been a terrible general because of his inability to compromise, and lack of patience for those that disagreed with him. [[Compromise is often a strength for Very Senior Leadership]]

**Extreme frugality**. Boyd's Stoic approach to life led him astray. He thought that if

> if a man can reduce his needs to zero, he is truly free: there is nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to hurt him (если у вас нену тети...)

He refused to ever purchase a home to raise his five children, and they despised him for it. He was so cheap that he carried his glasses in an old sock.

# Big Ideas

**To Be or To Do** refers to a famous speech delivered by Boyd, which came out of his realization that he would never make general:

> But hard work and success do not always go together in the military, where success is defined by rank, and reaching higher rank requires conforming to the military’s value system.

Boyd made powerful enemies due to his outspoken nature, his lack of reluctance to criticize his superiors, and his love of conflict with others.

Study after study shows that the higher in rank a military officer ascends, the less likely he is to make change.

Boyd's speech summarized succinctly:

> If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference.” He paused and stared into Leopold’s eyes and heart. “To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”

**How to comply without really complying**, Boyd was a master of this, for example when a general gave him a direct order to write a paper Boyd disagreed with, he complied, but then wrote a follow-up paper explaining in detail why he disagreed with his own paper.

> And he told the general he considered the two papers a package; if the first one were released, he would release the second.

Boyd did not succeed in [[Disagree without being disagreeable]], but still an interesting path.

**Snowmobiling**, John Boyd’s term, is how creativity really happens. It is destructive deduction combined with creative synthesis. Boyd used a thought experiment to show how destruction and creation lead to creativity. Unlike [Schumpeter's gale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction), Boyd emphasized creative synthesis. (see [[Snowmobiling - creativity is deduction followed by synthesis]]).

**Sun Tzu > von Clausewitz**. Here I am really unmoored, not having read von Clausewitz. Boyd was opposed to a WWI-era idea of bringing the enemy to a gigantic decisive battle, instead favoring Sun Tzu's approach of unraveling the enemy before the battle occurs, perhaps avoiding the battle entirely!

- Von Clausewitz believes wars are decided by set piece battles more than by strategy, deception, and guerrilla-like tactics. This means that even if he wins, there is a bloodbath.
- Sun Tzu believes in generating confusion, disorder, panic, and chaos. It's analogous to clipping the nerves, muscles, and tendons of an enemy, thus reducing him to jelly.

**Observe-Orient-Decide-Act**. Boyd is probably most famous for formulating the OODA loop, the process by which military strategists make decisions. By understanding it, one can develop an understanding of how to unravel one's enemy (see [[OODA Loops]]).

A key idea is that speed is of the essence. A successful commander must operate at a faster OODA Loop than does his opponent. This is why Boyd was so opposed to the idea of synchronization. This evening up the front line meant an army moves at the speed of its slowest unit.

One must truly understand how the enemy thinks to get under their skin (see [[Theory of Mind and unpredictability]]). Boyd's rejoinder to the machine-obsessed Air Force mindset was that

> “Machines don’t fight wars,” he responded. “Terrain doesn’t fight wars. Humans fight wars. You must get into the minds of humans. That’s where the battles are won.”

I love this human-centricity, and it's what got me into HCI in the first place. Without a good interface, the best software is garbage.

Next
- Watch El Cid, one of Boyd's favorite movies
- Is there some high level overview of military history? I feel a large gap, and Coram has done some good name-dropping:

> But some had never heard of Sun Tzu and could not spell “von Clausewitz.” They might have known the names of Douhet or Jomini or von Schlieffen or Fuller or Guderian or Lawrence or Balck, but few knew the theories espoused by these men.

(I know none of these men)

> He told them of Sun Tzu and the Battle of Leuctra in 371 B.C. and of Arbela in 331 B.C. and of Cannae in 216 B.C. He told them of Genghis Khan and Belisarius and Napoléon, of Heinz Guderian and of what made great commanders.

(I know few of these battles)

- Look into General Patton because this quote is amazing. Perhaps time to watch "Patton".

> A simplistic explanation of cheng and ch’i comes from General George Patton, who in World War II said his plan for attacking the Germans was to “hold them by the ~~nose~~ balls and kick them in the ass.” Holding them by the nose is the cheng. Kicking them in the ass is the ch’i.

- Probably worth reading Thomas Cleary's translation of Art of War. Lots of interesting aikido style ideas: "swordlessness", etc.
- What’s the story with Dick Cheney? In my mind he is forever tainted by the Iraq war, but honestly don't know much beyond that. He seems to have been quite respected in Boyd's acolyte circles.
- Check out the [Marine Corps Gazette](https://mca-marines.org/magazines/marine-corps-gazette/), which published a translation of Mao on guerrilla warfare in 1941, wrote extensively about Sun Tzu.
- Maybe read "Certain to Win: The Strategy of John Boyd, Applied to Business" for a more pre-digested take.
- Maybe watch "Legends of the Fall", a movie that seems to have affected Boyd emotionally (a rare thing).

Medieval Robots by E. R. Truitt

One of my early childhood fixations was the golden peacock clock in the Hermitage in Leningrad. Now, here is a whole book about ancient automata, combining my interests in Medieval history and AI! I listened to the audio version, which perhaps impoverished my experience of "reading", assuming the non-audio book includes the beautiful paintings, illustrations, and diagrams described in prose.

This was an academic and dry read overall. I liked the overall arc of the work, but often found the author getting a bit lost in the details. The book initially focuses on automata of antiquity and the Islamic world, a fascinating and unusual lens on already fascinating civilizations. The medieval European reaction to these suspicious contraptions, and how they inspired fictional accounts of automata in European culture follows, until the narrative is capped with later medieval European automata and clocks in particular. Overall a cogent narrative, but some sections feel unnecessary, especially the disturbing chapter 4.

We begin in early Greece, where work on automata was chronicled by Hiro of Alexandria, who built various steam based contraptions. The Antikythera mechanism was only recently uncovered, a complex, dynamic stellar map operated by hand crank dating back to 80 BCE. These works along with much of the rest of the Greek tradition were unknown to the medieval Europeans but preserved via the Arabic world (see [[Lost Enlightenment by Frederick Starr]]). During the Islamic enlightenment, many such contraptions were built. Al-Khwarizmi and many other famous Islamic scholars had a role to play in the automata creation too.

# Islamic automata
Europeans were first exposed to automata from the Abbasids and Byzantines via gifts. It wasn’t until Harun al-Rashid gifted Charlemagne a mechanical water fountain that the west renewed their interest in automata. Fictional and legendary automata began appearing in chivalric romances. The vast majority of early and high middle age writings on the topic were unsurprisingly in French (see [[Old French was spoken across a lot of Europe, hence Lingua Franca]]).

Most automata from this period do not exist, so all we have are writings of dubious reliability. For example, The Throne of Solomon, a Byzantine automaton was described by a Carolingian writer, who emphasized lions that roared and birds that chirped, as well as a mysteriously rising throne. Reminds me of Baron Vladimir Harkonen from Dune ([Lynch](https://youtu.be/mWq15lDh8yM?t=91), [Villeneuve](https://youtu.be/WQCV8O3oIU8?t=105)). The Carolingian work offered some, but surprisingly little speculation about how the Throne of Solomon worked. Perhaps a rising wine press mechanism? The sounds were likely pipe organ-like pneumatic devices, but the author did not speculate about this aspect at all.

Another famous automaton was the Elephant clock (from [Ismail al-Jazari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_al-Jazari)'s Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices), a Clepsydra, or water clock with ornate design and automaton functionality. It was far superior to that found in Charlemagne’s court. The technology and craftsmanship was next level. The cost to make it as well as the precision of the timepiece is far beyond candle clocks and sundials that the Frankish contemporaries were using at the time.

# Fictional automata in Europe
Chanson de Geste (Chivalric Romances in English) often featured a binary contrast between eastern cleverness and western faith. This is described in [Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_P%C3%A8lerinage_de_Charlemagne), a story about Charlemagne’s visit to the fictional Byzantine Emperor Hugo. In the narrative, Hugo is depicted as being superior in riches, technology and cleverness. But God stands by the side of the western Roman emperor, as Charlemagne's faith prevailed over Hugo's dubious Orthodoxy.

One vignette from the Benoit's [Roman de Troie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Troie), a Chivalric Epic about the Trojan War, stood out. In it, four golden automata in the Chambre de Beaute do various tasks around social control. One holds a mirror that helps you be presentable. The last is a robot that gives everyone perfect personalized social cues so that nobody loses face.

Another fictional automata described a contraption resembling a bronze knight with a spear, which whenever a Roman province threatened revolt, would point in its geographical direction. This magic is attributed to Virgil (what). Also, archers and buglers were often to be fictional automata that safeguarded cities from natural disaster or from barbarians. In one account, Naples had such guardians to warn its population about Vesuvius.

An automaton is not the same as a wine press. Because automata fall into the category of natura artifex and is more than just craftsmanship. There’s a god like element to that endeavor. Medieval Europeans would sometimes attribute the almost supernatural technology that they saw from the east to their superior civilization. But in other cases these automata would be attributed more to demonic means; sometimes to necromancy, sometimes to just being extremely vicious and vile. This helped confirm European superstitions. See [[Natura artifex — God, nature, and humanity]].

I really struggled through Chapter 4, "The Quick and the Dead" and nearly dropped the book. It features detailed and disgusting descriptions of a fictional automaton designed to preserve Hector of Troy's body by running alcoholic liquid through his embalmed corpse. Far too many details about balm, balsam, and other preservation techniques were both disgusting and overly detailed.

# European late medieval automata
Chapter 5 returns back to the core theme of the book, this time describing real automata from the late European Middle Ages.

The automata described in the chivalric romances purport to do advanced things like maintaining the social milieu of a royal court and other fantastical things still far beyond modernity's ability.

In contrast, real automata of the late Middle Ages were quite simple. The court of [Phillip II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain), for example, featured a room full of automata which embodied practical jokes, focusing mainly on surprising guests and making ladies clothes wet from above and, as emphasized in the chronicles, from below. These childish pranks mainly provided an endless source of entertainment for the royal class, but also served a more sinister function, separating those "in the know" from the outsiders.

The makers and maintainers of these automata in the 14th and 15th centuries tended to be painters. Painters of that era were highly respected, and typically oversaw groups of artisans to create the giant masterworks that they ended up creating.

Fascinating that the etymology of the word engine is from in engineer, or I guess in genius and genius, and it's just engineering. Is it also the same route where it's all about this ingenuity and genius

The escapement mechanism is almost a millennium old. A really great description of how it works can be found in [this masterpiece](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/#escapement) explaining how mechanical watches work.


## Clocks
Strasbourg Horloge is a really famous and elaborate Clark in Strasbourg. Inspired Robert Boyle Renee to cards and tons of others that took a mechanistic view of the human condition. Including Thomas Hobbes.

The Latin word for bell is "clocca", which is the etymology of the word clock. So clocks and timekeeping have always been associated with more than just the abstract notion of time, but also some kind of action. And thus they are intimately linked to automata.

Old Man's War by John Scalzi

A recommendation from MP, this is apparently one of the classics of the genre of Military Science Fiction. In addition to being a fun and quick read, I found it thought-provoking, and a really cool concept.

In a near-future earth, humans have traveled to other planets and made contact with aliens. As it turns out, our galaxy is teeming with intelligent, multi-planetary species far more advanced than us. And they're aggressive! To protect earth and its colonies against this thread, the humans have created the Colonial Defense Force (CDF). This galactic army is shrouded in mystery to the earth dwelling humans, which are bound to the planet. The only way for a human to leave earth is to take a leap of faith and sign your future septuagenarian self to fight for the CDF. And you can never go home again.

The book is not really profound, but skims some deeper than expected themes and references, including Arendt's banality of evil. This surpassed my expectations given the genre.

- Reincarnation: what happens when an army division consists entirely of octogenarians?
- Nature vs nurture (ghost brigades): what would it be like to be a completely different person with roughly the same set of genes?
- What is it like to love a person deeply, lose them, and then meet their clone?
- What is it like to gain a completely new body after living a full and long life?
- What would it be like to be battling a huge variety of unknown species all the time, where you have absolutely no idea what to expect?

Choice quotes:

> The problem with aging is not that it’s one damn thing after another—it’s every damn thing, all at once, all the time.

Fun tech mockery, like naming a personal assistant "asshole" and the resulting potty humor including “Activate Asshole” and "Go away Asshole", as well as the assistant confirming that "I am Asshole". And other crass hilarity like a female soldier activating her assistant with "Hey Bitch".

I enjoyed the world building quite a bit, from the whole premise of the book, to the various alien species encountered:

- The Consu, vaguely culturally Japanese, are a very advanced and enlightened species capable of destroying the humans easily, but interested in more profound goals. Honor and tradition seems to play a huge role in their culture, as is ritual honor based suicide clearly modeled after harakiri.
- The Whaidians, vaguely culturally Arabic, are brutally destroyed by the CDF. I suspect there is a political agenda here as well, with parallels to the War on Terror.
- A variety of other species which were only alluded to. A terrifying slime-mold which enters through your mouth and eats you from within. The Covandu, a tiny but intelligent species with high-tech weaponry, but so small they can be crushed underfoot like a bug.


Open questions:

- Why don't animals photosynthesize in addition to regular metabolism?
