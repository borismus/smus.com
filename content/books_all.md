Parables by Franz Kafka

cover: /assets/book-covers/parables.jpg

Many misses, for sure. But the hits I enjoyed were worthwhile:

**Imperial message**: a great image of an emperor so important and surrounded by such a large number of people that a messenger cannot possibly escape his orbit. A message delivered to the second person recipient will never be delivered. Bureaucracies. Perhaps solar systems. Your own mind. Sometimes there is no escape. 

**Tower of Babel and The City Coat of Arms**: Cute vignette of the construction of the tower delayed because of peoples insistence that progress is imminent, and that if we just wait a bit the whole project will be done much faster. So why bother starting? As generations pass, the nations living in the city planning to build the tower begin squabbling. Towards the end, a prophecy emerges that the lord will crush the city with five successive blows from a divine fist. Hence the fist on the coat of arms of the city. 

A bizarre take on Tower of Babel, featuring bureaucratic dysfunction and learned helplessness. 

**Before the law**: A man seeks entrance into The Law (I think the Torah version), but is prevented from entering by a guard because it is not time yet. The two exchange words and the man decides to wait until the time will come. He waits for many years, and the two have occasional conversations revealing that beyond this door lie more doors, with more guards. The man is undeterred and continues to wait. Near death, he gathers up the courage to ask his most pressing questions. After answering them, the guard announces he will be closing the door.

This short parable is told by a Priest, and the bulk of the story involves K. (Kafka?), the receiver of the story in conversation with the priest about various interpretation of the story. Is the man deluded? Is the guard? Who is more free? 

A fascinating, self-referential, format. I see the man as a stand-in for K., and the priest as a stand-in for the guard. Where does the reader fit? What about the author? Reminds me a lot of Borges, and a little bit of Ted Chiang. (I’d love to do a group reading session around a story like this. I miss my Multiplayer Essay concept.)

**Poseidon**: tracks the gate of an unhappy executive, appointed God of the Sea in the beginning, but perpetually unhappy, pining for “more cheerful work”. He was unable to sufficiently delegate to his subordinates and burned out completely. 


Arcadia by Tom Stoppard

It's pretty funny but in a very high falutin’ way, which detracts from the
comedy.

Isn’t that conjecture just Laplace’s Demon? From WP: 

> Laplace's demon is a hypothetical all-knowing being who knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, and therefore could use Newton's laws to reveal the entire course of cosmic events, past and future. Based upon the philosophical proposition of causal determinism.

Septimus & Chater demanding satisfaction exchange is hilarious!

Overall I’m struggling to follow the arc. Lots of wit but just very much a
comedy of errors. I might try again when I'm in a more frivolous headspace. 

A stray thought: I haven't tended to really enjoy plays much. Is this a lack of
imagination on my part? Perhaps it takes more work to truly imagine each
character delivering their lines without any of the scaffolding a narrator
provides...


Creativity by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
===
rating: yes
posted: June 7, 2022
cover: /assets/book-covers/creativity.jpg

I recently ran a book club at work discussing [Range](/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio), and CB mentioned that this book is less Gladwellian and more nuanced covering a similar theme.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of "Flow" fame is a psychologist, and takes a qualitative user research approach to the subject of creativity. He conducted interviews with 91 people that were deemed creative because of their impact on a field or because they helped to create a new one. He selected industry vets: people aged 60 and above from a variety of fields and cultures. Overall some gems but not without issues especially towards the end, where the book becomes less psychology and more self-help.

**Trend towards specialization**. Imagine three people: one a physicist and a musician and one that is both. All things equal, the specialists would probably be better at their crafts than the one that has chosen to split his attention between both. This naive treatment clearly foreshadows the possible benefits of the two fields interacting with one another. Like cross-training in sports.

**Creativity and unhappiness?**: Mihaly's research disconfirms the trope of the restless and miserable creative soul. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky aren’t unhappy because they are creative but because of their residence in a nearly collapsing Russian empire. American poets that commit suicide do it because of their social circles and their poor compensation.

**Creativity is social**: the author presents a socially mediated view of creativity. Society ultimately decides if you are creative or not. If you think you are creative but nobody else agrees, you might just be a kook!

**Three kinds of creativity**:

1. **Brilliant**: People with varied interests and a quick wit. Great conversationalists.
2. **Personal Creativity**: People who see the world in a unique way, different from others.
3. **Creativity**: People who change the world by introducing some new concept, technique, or invention. This is the emphasis of the book and what the author means by

There isn’t any correlation between these types. Many brilliant people are not creative. Many personally creative people don't have any impact. But creative people change the world in some significant way. This notion of Creativity reminds me more of the distinction [[Novelty creation invention innovation terms]]. Feels like the sense is after is the strongest: innovation. It must have impact.

Paradoxically whether someone is Creative or Personally Creative depends on society. Bach was not recognized as creative until several generations after his death when Mendelssohn re-discovered him. So you would have to say that he was only posthumously creative. Weird flex, but the author embraces it. Other examples include John Donne, a 16th century poet, who fell into obscurity only to be revived in the 20th century by TS Eliot. Van Gogh who was never recognized during his life.

Talent is also orthogonal to creativity. You might just be in the right place at the right time. Genius is also not required, and most creative people don't identify as such. Genius is mostly a label others apply to describe the most standout individuals.

**Three requirements for creativity**:

1. Domain: an area of inquiry.
2. Field (community): the gatekeepers in this area, the scene and people
3. Individual: using the symbols of a Domain, a person creates something that is approved by the Field.

(Somewhat weird distinction between 1 and 2. Domain is the subject, field is the people.)

Why are there so many great architects and painters in the Italian Renaissance? Obviously not because some individuals (3) randomly got really creative. It’s more about the domain (1) and field (2). In other words, it’s the collective scenius that empowers individuals (see [[Four ingredients for Scenius]]). This is an insightful reminder. Still individual administrators and patrons can help or hurt here. For example the Medici played their part in catalyzing this Renaissance.

- Filippo Brunelleschi's Duomo at Florence.
- Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise.

**Structured vs. diffuse domains**: Some domains are structured and so it’s easy to understand great contributions to the domain quickly. A student can chime in with a groundbreaking idea and professor may be able to evaluate it on the spot. (Eg. physics). Others are diffuse and so insights take many years to properly evaluate. (Eg. personality psychology).

Interesting framing on culture. Culture is something that rank orders attention. If all paintings are equally worthwhile, there is no culture. This is inherently a competitive process.

# Traits of creative people

**Curiosity** is a key trait found in all interview subjects. If you don’t remain curious, you are unlikely to persevere in adversity (see [[What can increase curiosity]]). Many people in the sample tended to follow their interests (see [[Follow your interests]]).

Many were the beneficiaries of **cultural capital** from their upbringing. Coming from a family of books and broad interests all lead to an advantage.

Also you needed a **basic amount of social skills** to enter into a field and convince people of your worth. Even Isaac Newton, notorious for his antisocial ways, had to convince an early mentor of his promise.

**Creative personality?** Not really a thing, argues the author. But he thinks that people that are creative tend to have a complex personality, containing **multitudes of personas within one individual**. They are often able to express a lot of different emotions and be a bit unpredictable. This resonates and reminds me of AC and AK and IB and other great designers I've worked with.

**Contradictory traits**: According to Jung, every strong suit has a shadowy side. This is very clearly an inspiration for Joe Edelman and well expressed in the game we played at HumSys called [[Out of Character game]]. The author provides a list of contradictory traits that a creative person typically has. Ordinarily this would be asinine, but the way this is presented in the book is generative and not prescriptive.

Importantly, it’s not about striking a bland balance in between the two poles, but about knowing when to practice each extreme, and be flexible in switching between the poles as needed. I found this to be very insightful. [[Polarity strategy — alternate between poles rather than finding middle ground]]

- Energetic, yet able to scale back energy as needed. For the mood or the flexibility. Sexually driven yet practicing abstinence.
- Smart enough to master a field but naive enough to ask probing questions that others might take for granted.
- Able to practice both divergent and convergent thought. Flexibility and originality is important for divergence. But you still need to converge. Good judgement and recognizing a viable problem is extremely important there. If most people have a 5% success rate in their ideas but you can achieve 50%, you have a much higher chance of striking gold.
- Playful but disciplined.
- Introverted sometimes but extroverted at other times. You need time to focus and write, but also key to know the field and get feedback from peers.
- Masculine and feminine features. Psychologically androgynous.
- High highes and low lows. More pleasure, fun, excitement about the intrinsic pleasure of the process of doing the work. Simultaneously, after the euphoria of completion expires or when you are blocked (eg. Writers block), there are low lows.

Important: you can’t just seek novelty. To strive to be unique is to be like anything BUT something. This is a negative framing and rarely generative. Similar critiques to postmodernism (not modernism), and denazification. (See [[Positive visions are necessary]])

# Creative process
1. Prepare
2. Be fortunate while slacking
3. Synthesize

**Inspiration from real life**. Writers and poets are often inspired by important events in their life. Usually suffering. Artists often take copious cut outs of visuals they find in the world. Scientists have a less direct connection from experiences. But early experiences often drive people into the field. Maybe they aren’t athletic. Or naturally gravitate towards books. More specific examples:

- Planck, Heisenberg, driven by a sense of awe from exposure to the outdoors and tall peaks and night sky.
- Linus Pauling inspired by his father's pharmacy combining two substances into a totally new one.

**Presented vs. discovered problems**. This is a great framework, which is very similar to [[Hill climbing vs hill finding]]. Many creative people discover problems, and this requires a certain amount of slack.

**The need for slack**: why do we need slack at all? It seems that Many creative people tend to sleep on a problem, or take a long break between hard bouts of work, or favoring silent walks and drives to work, or going for a run to take a break… and that is when the insight comes. Something happens when the mind is given a chance to rest. [[Resilient systems need slack]].

(Note to self: I don’t do this enough. I’m always listening to something in my downtime. I should enjoy more quiet walks.)

Why does this happen? Maybe it's the same thing that happens when you sleep? Sleep cements connections that matter, and cleans up others that don't (see [[Sleep has a profound effect on memory and learning]])

So much creativity comes from combining ideas from different domains. Even the electronic fuel controllers for jet engines invented by Frank Offner came from synthesizing ideas from cybernetics with physics!

# Flow
Csikszentimihalyi is most famous for his book called Flow, and it's woven into this book, but feels a bit out of place (full list [[Csikszentimihalyi's flow]] for reference).

The secret to life is to experience flow from as many things as possible. Then everything you do will be worth doing for its own sake. Conditions of flow are often met in games. Related to the [[Game mindfulness — detect games around you]].

**Internalize the field** Key ability: internalize the field to have a good sense for what the field will accept and what they will not. Have a lot of ideas and then critically have a good razor for separating those that are good from those that are not.

# Creativity and place
People love going to nice places to do creative stuff. Aspen conference is at a world class resort. Salk institute is right on the beach. There is no evidence for or against physical beauty helping creativity, largely because there is no way to make such an RCT study happen.

**Creativity and walking**. Perhaps a prepared mind will be more effective in a beautiful setting? Very speculative. Part of the benefit of walking is that your mind is focused on the surroundings, introducing more distraction. It adds slack. (I should do regular walking 1:1s with my in-person reports.)

**A space to be creative**. Key for creativity: a special placed tailored to your needs, a place are comfortable and you are fully in control. (My house is desperately missing this.) Kenneth Golding worked from a cabin overlooking Rockies and used the hot tub regularly. Jonas Salk worked in a studio with a piano and an easel. Living a life of personal creativity seems like a worthy goal.

# New domains across disciplines
[[True creativity unlocks whole new fields]]

# Meandering paths
Many creative people take a very indirect path to get to their ultimate destination. This is the thesis of Range as well.

Michael Snow, a famous Canadian artist, musician and composer is an example of someone that takes insights from one domain and applies them to others. He has touched film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music, a shocking breadth.

Ilya Romanovich **Prigogine** had a deep interest in music, art, and philosophy but was convinced to become a lawyer by his parents. So he studied law but wasn’t satisfied with its mechanistic applications. So he began studying the psychology and then neurochemistry of why people commit crimes. Finding this was too ambitious of a scope he refocused on the neurochemistry of cells. This led him to disapprove systems and his Nobel prize. What a polymath, dang. I'm only more impressed by the man. (See [[Dissapative far from equilibrium systems]]).

# Developing creativity
Stories of early precocity are often confirmatory. A sense of inner consistency demands that people who have achieved greatness should have done it from an early age. But in practice, it’s hard to predict if someone will become creative at a young age. One consistent pattern: curiosity and deep interests as young children.

In many cases parents play a key role. Treat your kid like a peer, an adult and don't talk to them.

Expose your kid to the vast variety of life at an early age. This is a key role of any good parent. This includes sports, arts, music, sciences, mathematics, travel, literature, etc. (Rhymes a lot with [[Give kids a sampling period]])

**School**: The effect of school is generally pretty negative or neutral. Not generally something that is recalled. But a teachers influence is often significant. They often push a gifted student towards their interests and at a level that exceeds that of the rest of the class. But not too hard so as to keep them interested. (I should focus on the teachers at our kids school as opposed to the school itself. How can I quickly evaluate them given the parent teacher limited time?) That said many great creative people didn’t have a specific teacher-muse they cited.

**The Teenage Years Suck**: most creatives tend not to be too popular because they are engrossed with their interests. They might not be as sexually active and tend to spend more time “in the nest”. In most cases the peer group is not intellectual. Nobody in the group recalls teenage years fondly.

**Luck**. World War II enabled many women to enter hard sciences because the men usually occupying the seats were all away fighting in the war.

**Stable family life**. Also extremely important and common among creative people. Pauling's politically incorrect advice: find a wife that will just take care of all of the home life for you.

**Creative aging?** Surprisingly many people interviewed had a pretty steady output from 30 onward. Some people peak towards end of life. Frank Lloyd Wright architected the Guggenheim at 70! (This does strike me as a bit self serving: firstly, the author is himself not young.)

**Crystallized intelligence**: A decline in energy is common with age, but skills continue to get honed even at old age. You can sometimes think sharper and faster as a result of what the author calls "crystallized intelligence". Discipline and attitude also improves over age. Seasoned creative subjects had already achieved greatness, and so many experienced less pressure, and could be more trustful of their instincts.

One big challenge I resonate with is to find time to keep doing the core work, since people tend to accumulate administrative responsibilities with age.

# How to be more personally creative
The narrative devolves into a case study and then closes as a self help book. Becoming Creative is tricky and dependent on many factors like match quality, and buy-in from your field. But you can reliably become more Personally Creative, which according to Mihaly is intrinsically fulfilling.

Specific advice for cultivating curiosity:

1. Try to **be surprised every day**. Stop and look at the new car. Try a new dish. Actually listen to your colleague for a  Life is nothing but a stream of experiences. The more widely and deeply you swim in it, the richer it will be.
2. Try to **surprise at least one person every day**. Express an opinion you wouldn’t normally reveal. Ask a question you’d not normally ask. Break your routine: invite someone to a show! Experiment with your appearance. (Feels a bit edge lord)
3. Write down what surprised you and your most surprising action each evening. Review your notes weekly. (I think this is generic advice for keeping notes and in general I’m very much in favor.)
4. Follow sparks of interest broadly. Be open to learning. [[Follow your interests]]

Self help continues. Try a randomly sampled diary to see what you enjoy and what you don’t enjoy. Do more things you enjoy and fewer things you don’t enjoy. (At this point the advice becomes a bit farcical, and I can't help but wonder if reading a book about how to become more creative is a bit like reading a book about how to get better at your tennis serve. My point is that creativity feels very tacit and requiring praxis.)

Anyway I think his framing of personality change is somewhat unattractive. For me the [[Strength is a skill]] framing is generative here. It’s better to think of these things as skills than tweaks to one’s personality. Here are 3 in particular:

1. Learn to foster traits that are complimentary to your main mode. If introverted, see what it’s like to be extroverted. What are the pros and cons of each? What feels good about it? What scares you about it? Again, [[Out of Character game]] is a great way to deliberately practice this.

2. Especially important for creativity is the ability to switch between convergent and divergent modes of thinking. See [[Diverge and converge modes of thinking]].

3. Aim for complexity. Too much integration means you are a caricature of yourself; easily predicted and one dimensional. Too simple. Too much differentiation means too end up being just a random assortment of unrelated ideas. Too chaotic. See [[Cynefin framework]].


Interesting tidbit on relationships: it’s important to be able to shift moment by moment from our own viewpoint to that of another.

> We can see depth only because looking with two eyes give us slightly different perspectives. How much deeper can we see when instead of two eyes we rely on four?


The End of Eternity by Isaac Asimov
===
rating: yes
posted: May 11, 2022
cover: /assets/book-covers/end-of-eternity.jpg

Truly masterful, this book. The way Harlan wants to control Noys mirrors perfectly the way the Eternals want to control reality. Just like Harlan takes her for himself by transporting her to the 100,000th century,

Asimov's views are super complex. Much more complex than the one dimensional technologist I tend to associate with him. Maybe he has suffered more than I thought in light of his habits as a womanizer. But he has many interesting takes, and Noys is not nearly as simple as she initially seems, and is revealed to be the one in charge. Asimov does espouse a certain inevitability of progress. Though mathematician's names change as a result of Reality changes, the nature of math doesn’t. And it all appears to move in lockstep. And he does initially seem like he believes that humans are bound to kill ourselves unless subjected to some kind paternalism. At the end, it's a much more complex and interesting take on both progress and women.

I initially found a certain lack of imagination on Asimov's part when Harlan is described traveling between centuries. Surely the vast timespan would yield a far greater variety of interesting societies than those found in the book? Like the cultural mores and the living conditions feel a bit too cyclical and predictable. This is partly explained by the mass duplicator though, a nice touch! Even more impressively, this is explained when the whole thrust of the book is explained: Reality over all Time is made safe and homogenous by the Allwhen Council's interventions.

I love how precarious Reality feels in the book. I feel a similar precarity in our own reality today. We are just a hair away from collapse, and we keep squeaking by. Why? Perhaps the Eternals are watching…

# World building
Asimov invented a compelling and original concept to tackle time travel.

There is our regular flow of time: Time, Reality. And in parallel, there is Eternity, which lets Eternals travel to any Time in Reality and return back to Eternity using a device hilariously called a Kettle.

The top Eternal brass sits in the Allwhen Council. This council consists of Computers, who back in 1955 when the book was written, were people that did math. They make mathematical models of Reality, and intervene in it to prevent societal collapse. They aim for changing as little as possible, while averting calamity and keeping humanity on the right track throughout the ages. In their technical lingo, they make the Minimal Necessary Change (MNC) to achieve the Maximal Desired Response (MDR). Cute!

Eternals still age on their own timeline, in "physioyears". It’s just that Eternity is completely disconnected from the specific year in Time you happen have been born in. They are carefully selected for and plucked from Reality at a young age, swearing a solemn vow to leave their old life behind. They are supposed to be perfect beings, but in practice are extremely flawed individuals.

Eternals also facilitate trade between centuries in Reality. This becomes especially interesting when one century wants a cancer curing drug from another century. The fact that all of these cancer patients would no longer die poses big problems for the eternals. Such a huge change could not be permitted by the Allwhen Council.

Any interactions with Reality is precarious. Eternals are careful to avoid making accidental changes. A change typically has high impact on subsequent centuries, but its impact reduces the further into the future you go.

# Live-streamed impressions
As I read this book, I took notes describing where I expected the story would go. I was wrong every time. Obviously, spoilers abound, but you knew that already. Here are some such notes:

- Looks like the protagonist Andrew just got a girl Noys pregnant though… this’ll be fun
- Interesting… it seems to have turned even more radically. The one MNC that the protagonist found himself involved in caused his beloved Noys to disappear completely.
- At this point I’m convinced that Finge is just testing the protagonist to see if he has what it takes to graduate to the next level.
- No— another twist. (It’s fascinating to record my own reaction to the book as I read it). Apparently Finge is merely pointing out a flaw in Noys' matriarchal society, which believes that Eternals live forever and so seduces Harlan in a calculated way. (Is Finge really motivated to annoy Harlan or is he driven by his own job? I suspect the latter and Harlan is just immature.)
- Does Asimov see the problem with leaving Noys thousands of centuries in the future all alone? Seems extremely lonely, although I guess Harlan’s visits can be arbitrarily frequent? Or can they if she’s in eternity? Do they share the same physiological time since they are both in eternity?
- After travel is blocked beyond the 100,000 century. Why is Harlan so convinced of his importance? Is it an immature petulance and overconfidence? What secret weapon does he hide that he could use against the Council of Allwhen?
- Nice — so it’s not just petulance. Instead Harlan has been thinking behind the scenes of the book. He deduced (in a twist) that Eternity would be impossible as described by the historical events of the chronicle. Because of his familiarity with “primitive history” he found The math required to understand time travel in the 24th century was unavailable until the 27th. And Harlan’s role is to coach a pupil who will in fact travel to the 24th to create this “original sin” of time travel.
- Asimov's broadly concerned for continued human existence. We are bound to kill ourselves unless subjected to some kind paternalism. Every time we invent nuclear weapons…
- Onto these “hidden centuries” in the distant future where there is only eternity and no Reality. What’s that about? It’s hinted at at the start but hardly at all until this “limbo” state that Harlan and Twissel end up in. And why are they alone for days? Where did everyone else go?
- I didn’t have a great guess as to why Harlan is unable to travel past the 100,000th century, but Twissel did. He speculated that Eternity actively prevents human evolution, because the Eternals make sure that nothing goes wrong. But what does it mean for something to “go wrong”? And so the Eternals are just conservative and insist on nothing ever changing. This is why Twissel from the 30,000th century is nearly identical to Harlan from the 95th. Eternity stopped evolution.
- And so, with this in mind, Twissel speculates that future humans from the hidden centuries deliberately thwarted Eternity’s meddling with them so that the natural order of things can be resumed. But is this speculation? There appears to be no barrier anymore!
- Harlan’s tantrum when he feels like he was turned into a marionette by some mysterious force that blocked him from traveling back into the 100,000th centuries to see Noys is a great piece of drama. He is so blind to his own shortcomings!
- Wow man, this book is so insanely full of twists. Now it is Noys who is the post-Eternal that was actually pulling all the strings? She was the one that setup Finge and Harlan and Twissel and played them off one another? I looked back in the book even, and it’s true: she did stop the kettle at the exactly 111,394, very subtly.
- Noys' explanation is an interesting one and ties to another mysterious previously mentioned in the novel: that of space faring. The fact that Eternity had such a skeptical attitude to space faring and actively prevented humans from engaging in it, led to a situation where humanity was earthbound, while other intelligent beings were colonizing our galaxy. As a result, people were capable of space travel, but stuck on a prison planet (a dim vision - seems like a stretch). Asimov indirectly argues for the intrinsic benefit of humanity eventually becoming a multi-planetary civilization.


# Time travel is hard
I was almost thrilled that this was a time travel story without paradox. But of course it’s not! For example this business with an infinite time loop of Cooper/Mallahsohn needing to travel from the future to 2317 is completely problematic! If this indeed happens a bunch of times, would it happen an infinite number of times? And what if there’s any deviation any of those times? The whole thing is too unstable.

Fascinating solution to the paradox problem of seeing yourself in reality: if this event happens you trigger an automatic change to prevent it from ever happening. So it can never be you that you see in reality. Kind of a clean solution, but definitely suffers from all of the known issues with time travel.

# Connections
I see a lot of echoes of [[Greatness Cannot Be Planned]] and overall Eternity follows [[The Authoritarian High-Modernist Recipe for Failure]]. The ultimate failure of Eternity is the usual: a group of flawed humans making centralized decisions about the future on behalf of all of humanity. In fact, at one point, in conversation with Harlan, Twissel reveals his complete ignorance of markets. This is even more pronounced in the 1987 Soviet rendition of the book, in which the Allwhen Council is transparently portrayed as a group of stooges sitting at the Supreme Soviet.

> Noys said: In ironing out the disasters of Reality, Eternity rules out the triumphs as well. It is in meeting the great tests that mankind can most successfully rise to great heights.

To which Harlan woodenly replies “The greatest good for the greatest…”, a great illustration of some limitations of utilitarianism.

The end is a bit rushed and marred with overly complex time loops, but overall a great work!


Genesis by ✨ translated by Robert Alter
===
rating: yes
posted: May 1, 2022
cover: /assets/book-covers/genesis.jpg

Genesis is not so much a book, but an “accretion of sundry traditions, shot through with disjunctions and contradictions, and accumulated in an uneven editorial process over several centuries”. The Hebrew word for book, “Sefer” actually translates more to scroll than to book, and scrolls are much more fungible than books. A scroll can be stitched to another scroll, split, and spliced, and rarely has named attribution. Not a coherent artwork by a single author, Genesis is more like a cathedral of medieval Europe, the product of many hands, involving an elaborate process of editing, like the greatest Hollywood films.

Main sources of compilation include {Y/J}ahwist (J), Elohistic (E), and Priestly (P) source documents. J and E might be contemporary and early, P dates to about 6th century BCE. But all is hotly debated.

The translator lambastes his contemporary commentators for being too focused on the sourcing and not sufficiently focused on analyzing the material itself, while refining medieval commentators like Rashi & Abraham bin Ezra.

Genesis split into primeval history (1-11) and a focus on the past, how this all came to be, told in a formal, repetitive way. Bulk of the book is patriarchal tales (12-50) which is focused on the future, promising long-term national greatness etc. Here the style changes, becomes much more concerned with human affairs, emotions, feuds, violence, and constant struggle.

The narrative arc is really clean: “Genesis begins with the making heaven and earth and all life, and ends with the image of a mummy — Joseph’s — in a coffin.”

# Themes and surprises

**Nomads vs. farmers**: The story of Cain and Abel is about the superiority of the noble nomadic herdsmen (Abel) over the terrible and evil sedentary farmers (Cain). Echoes of this later “for every shepherd is abhorrent to Egypt” (46:34)

**Displacement of the firstborn** Cain and Abel is also the start of the theme of how the firstborn often gets screwed, despite their birth order. Similar story with Esau and Jacob.

**Not children of Cain**: I wrongly thought that humans were descended from Cain. No — Cain and Abel had a third brother, Seth.

**Antediluvian ages**: Methuselah, known for his long life, was 969 years old, but that is only moderately impressive in the grand scheme of things. Adam died at the ripe old age of 930, his son Seth at 912. Cain died young at 730.

**Magical beings**: What the heck are the Nephilim (6:1)?

**Sexual mystery**: What is it that Canaan actually did to his grandfather Noah when he became drunk? (9:20)

**Abram's military conquest**: Chedorlaomer, king of Elam (what a name!) abducted Lot and his crew, and Abram had to raise an army of 318 people and wage war to bail him out!

**Abram's ritual**: in 15:15, Abram cleaves his farm animals in twain, leaves the halves in some sort of bizarre ritual. He then falls into a deep slumber. He wards off carrion birds, and sees smoke and fire. No drugs involved?

**Ishmael's short stick**: Shockingly disparaging of Ishmael "He shall be a wild ass of a man; His hand against everyone, And everyone’s hand against him"

**Barely monotheism:** El Elyon, El-Roi, El Shaddai, God Most High. There are so many different Semitic gods fused into one here. Sometimes god is referred to Elohim (literally "gods" — plural). Jewish Monotheism is clearly only just emerging in these passages.

**Surrogate slave mothers**: Ishmael was born to Abraham from Hagar (Sarah's servant). And only two of Jacob's children were born to him from Rebeca.

**Lot and his daughters**: Lot unambiguously offered up his own virgin daughters to be raped in the angels’ stead (19:7). Later, he and his virgin daughters settled in a cave, and then had children via their own father (19:31). Deeply disturbed.

**Hands and thighs**: apparently cupping someone else's genitals or at least putting your hand near there is part of the act of solemn oath taking in ancient societies (24:2). This also happens when Jacob asks Joseph to bury him with the other patriarchs (47:29).

**Apocryphal camels**: The translator suggests that camels in the bible are not actually historical. Archaeological evidence suggests that they weren’t adapted to the climate until several centuries after the patriarchal period.

**Named wells:** Water is extremely important in the desert. Water rights are key, and Abraham battles Abimelech over this (21:22). Wells are so important, the wells have names (26:17)

**Wells and betrothals**: Abraham's servant meets Rebekah (betrothed to Isaac) at a well (24:14). Later, Jacob meets Rachel at a well (29:10). In Exodus Moses meets Zipporah in the same manner.

**Laban is a real slimeball**: Such a greedy dude, obsessed with jewlery (24:30), and then tricks Jacob into working him for 14 years. And still Jacob was unable to take his harem (2 wives, 2 slave girls, 9 children) without asking Laban’s permission (30:29). Quite the scene with Laban furious over his stolen idol, in which Jacob inadvertently condemns his beloved to death (31:32), followed by another gem, in which Rachel sits on a cushion concealing the stolen figurine and pleading to her father that she has menses and cannot get up. (31:35).

**Girl names**: anyone looking for a biblical name for their baby girl? I recommend Oholibamah. There is also Basemath, although I guess it’s pronounced bass-seh-mat. Or consider Mehetabel.

**Boy names**: highly recommend naming them like Benjamin did. And he had a lot of kids: Bella and Beecher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, **Muppim and Huppim** and Ard.

**Juda* the traitor**: Judah sells his brother (37:20), and Judas sells his brother Jesus Christ.

**Tamar and Judah**: Tamar is I guess fixated on getting a son by Judah’s lineage (Er) one way or another, so in desperation dresses like a whore and seduces Judah. Is it normal for Judah to go whoring? (38:16)

**Joseph the autist**: “And look” is Joseph’s signature childish excitement. He seems to have no ability to read the room. No wonder his brothers hated him so much! (41:1)

**Jacob and Joseph were embalmed**: Jacob was embalmed (50:3), and Joseph was even mummified and placed in a coffin (50:26). Surprisingly Egyptian for a forefather.

Grand Transitions by Vaclav Smil

Up front approach is interesting. Having worked with Jay Forester at MIT on early modeling, Smil is not a big believer in models.

Instead of simple models Smil takes a more contingent, event based approach to the topic. Some things progress in an evolutionary way. But others are dependent on human action and sudden unexpected discontinuities. Even the title “Grand Transitions” harkens to a punctuated equilibrium view of progress.

Smil alludes to the [[Expected vs unexpected inventions]] framing I first heard from Clarke (see [[Profiles of the Future by Arthur Clarke]]). He thinks that information scaling inventions like the printing press and the internet tend are especially likely to have unexpected consequences and break existing models.

# S curves everywhere
Reminiscent of Perez in her [[Installation vs deployment phases of innovation (Carlotta Perez)]], Smil sees S-curves everywhere and warns about over-extrapolating exponential growth. Reminds me that [[Forecasting s-curves is hard]].

**Human ➡ animal ➡ machine power**: draft horses peak in 1910 at 20 million draft horses in the US and are then obsoleted by mechanical tractors, but this transition takes decades. As they grow, populations of draft horses and tractors form S curves:

**Transatlantic travel** only became possible in the 15th century. Then sailing frigates took about a month to cross. Steam powered ships that would eventually take an order of magnitude less time (Lucitania in 4 days). This transition took a century around 1830-1930. Then the transition to jet air travel, yielded a further reduction of 1.5 orders of magnitude (5h). This was a much faster transition of just a decade or so in the 1950s.

But not all “epochal transitions” pan out as S-curves. Some exponential growth turns out to be a false start in retrospect.

**Early electric cars** were the first and most promising ground transport in the late 19th century. The first car to reach 100 km/h was electric. Edison bet big on them but gas internal combustion won instead. Smil doesn’t elaborate as to why but I suspect energy density has a big role to play (more on this later). It isn’t until now that the epochal transition to EVs is underway. But predictions are such that we won’t have majority electric on the roads until at least 2040.

**Nuclear energy generation** is another example of a false start that looks even more bleak. Peaking at 17% of global energy output, current projections are just 4% of global energy by 2040. Culprits appear to be going over budget and safety. Also see [[Nuclear power is hampered by regulation (ALARA)]].

# Demographic transitions
The developed world is characterized by a shift in equilibrium from high fertility and high mortality to a new one, balancing low fertility and low mortality.

**Demographic dividend** refers to the benefit a polity experiences when the majority of its citizens are of working age. The ratio of working population (20-65) to their dependents (young and old) is an interesting metric to track. A society with high mortality and high fertility has an young average age, and many young dependents. As mortality and fertility decrease, the average citizen is of working age and the society reaches a stage of development that pays a high demographic dividend because many workers support few dependents. In next equilibrium, the average population becomes old and once again there are many dependents.

**Median ages vary hugely per country**. The Japanese median age is 47.3, while the Guatemalan median age is 22.1. The demographic dividend will be greatly advantageous to young countries (see [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age)).

Smil is pretty pessimistic about lifespan extension because he sees it as an S-curve that tapers out at around 80 years old. Increased societal longevity should definitely come with an older retirement age!

Japan leads the way here and is projected to be depopulating at a huge rate. 120 M now. 100 M by 2050. 88 M stable state. Villages are shrinking.

**Urban vs rural footprints**: Smil criticizes cities for being terrible polluters. This directly contradicts the common wisdom that cities and dense living is far more efficient per-capita. Isn’t it actually quite good to be in a city because of the benefits of proximity?

Smil's argument is that cities are actually worse per capita from an environment perspective. A villager that moves to town may have been used to one light per room but now has a bigger TV. Another urban downside is that heat islands are 3-8 degrees higher in cities.

Which one is right?

**Humans win mammal population density**: 50k humans / square km density in parts of Manila is equivalent to 2kg of human biomass per square m. This is than for any mammal.

# Economic transitions
Although agriculture is only 0.7% of the GDP, it is underrated: “Let those economists live off the main sector of GDP: financial services,” quips Smil.

**Agriculture improvements**: Huge yield gains. Lots of automation in food production, clear when you consider output in terms of time per weight of output. (Interesting idea: use agriculture as a terminus for [[Asimov's Tech Tree]])

- 1800: 7 minutes per kilogram of wheat. Tools: two oxen, a wood plow, brush harrows, sickles to cut, flails to thresh.
- 1900: 25 seconds per kilogram of wheat, an 18x improvement. heavy horses, a steel gang plow led by a team, iron tooth harrows, seed drill, horse drawn combine for harvesting and threshing.
- 2000: 6 seconds per kilogram, a 4x improvement. Large tractors are equivalent to 500 horses, high capacity combines.

Farming trends:

- Specialization: 5 crops per farm in 1900 -> 1.1 crops per farm in 2000.
- Centralization: fewer but larger farms.

**Energy subsidies**: Modern agriculture requires a lot of additional energy beyond just the natural sunlight, in the form of fertilizer, irrigation, fuel for farm equipment. 4% of global energy goes to these energy subsidies. Without them, we couldn’t feed the current population of 7.5B.

**Animals are especially energy-intensive**: Based on this line of thinking, animals cost a lot more based on just the energy required to produce the feed. Animals also require structures and maintenance of those structures. And there are additional costs around transportation.

[[History of crop rotation technology]]

**Fertilizers and side effects**: Guano was used as early fertilizer. By 1824, there was an active Peruvian import business. Nitrate was the first inorganic fertilizer. Use of Fertilizers meant crops grow better and are more attractive to pests. Thus, insecticides.

**Feeding draft animals**: There is a complex relationship between draft animals, and the feed they require which detracts from crop yields. More than half of all food production is animal feed (!). Smil suggests that animals could be far more sustainable if they were allowed to graze naturally.

(There's a nice opportunity to explain these things using feedback loops, along the lines of [[Horses, peasant mobility and urbanization]]. Just like in the middle ages, draft animals and farm mobility in general cuts across all these aspects: planting, harvesting with combines, and transportation.

**Animal mass to feed ratios**: A metric to measure the efficiency of animal protein production. Input is weight of feed, output is the animal weight that can be consumed.

- Chickens: 3:1 (3 kg and feed produces 1 kg of chicken)
- Pork: 9:1
- Beef: 25:1

For aquaculture it’s 3:1 but varies with species. For example, it's 1.8 for farmed Atlantic Salmon.

**Dietary patterns**: Two major attractors for dietary patterns as societies become more affluent.

1. Western-style 3200 kcal per day and 30% of calories from animal products.
2. Mediterranean/Asian style has fewer calories per day (2400 kcal) and less reliance on animal products.

Remarkable stats in Japan. Rice intake (by weight) went from 60-70 percent in 1950 to just 20% today. Now the Japanese diet is more dairy than rice (by calories) and this shift in just 50 years post WW2.


Smil is genuinely impressed with the long way we’ve come on ending malnutrition and famines, though a combination of increased farming efficiency and science (see [[List of micronutrients and deficiencies in humans]]). But he's miffed that this truly amazing story gets so little airtime in terms of “great innovations to celebrate” compared to smartphones and Steve Jobs and as he disparagingly puts it “putting new cardboard on electronics manufactured in China”.

This reminds me a lot of this idea from [[What can a technologist do to accelerate electrification]]:

> The inconveniences of daily life are not the significant problems. The world that scrolls past you on Twitter is not the real world.

# Energy transitions

The usual energy progression is this:

1. Wood
2. Coal
3. Oil
4. Gas

Smil tracks the dates at which each country transitioned from mostly X to mostly Y. Transition years vary widely by country. England moved to coal very early and this catalyzed the Industrial Revolution.

Some countries and regions skipped whole steps, for example going straight from wood burning to oil and never ramping up and coal industry, or jumping directly to hydroelectricity.

**Transportation**: There's an impressive increase in shipping container payload: from 100 twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) in 1950 to 23,000 TEU in 2020.

**Kerosene vs. diesel vs. gasoline, etc**: Oil (aka Petroleum) is generally found as a yellowish-brown liquid in geological formations. It can then be refined into a variety of fuels. Kerosene (aka paraffin) is the basis for airplane fuel. Diesel fuel has many applications from small engines powering a private car to large marine engines. There are many other kinds of petroleum based fuel types, including Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) which powers some of the largest container ships.

**Air travel**: Kilometers traveled per passenger is a useful metric for quantifying air travel. It's hard to predict where this S-curve will level out.

**Horses vs oxen**: Smil estimate of horse power vs ox power is surprising. 7x human for horse and only 2.5x human for ox?! This is surprising, since I read elsewhere ([[Medieval Technology and Social Change by Lynn White]]) that horses were quite weak compared to oxen, although this was before selective breeding made them stronger, and before horse collars.

**Power-to-weight ratios**: Turbofans have the highest watts per kg density of any machine. (How does my e-foil motor compare? Back of napkin calculation the 65161 has max output 6 kW and weight 3 kg.)

**Electricity is amazing**: Smil writes a real ode to electricity. It's a marvel that powers all of modernity: lossless to deliver from station to home. Completely silent and non polluting at conversion point. Safe. Easy to convert to motion heat and light. The world saw extremely rapid electrification of urban and rural households. From start to finish, the S-curve took only 75 years. Energy transitions take decades, even if highly desirable.

**Lumens per watt**: A metric for measuring light efficiency. Incandescent to CFL to LED. It's plummeted over the last two centuries.

**Cooking range transitions**: early ranges were electric, then switched to gas and are now returning to electric induction stoves. Has this transition happened?

**So many air conditioners**: Wild that us a conditioner penetration is 95% in the US. I double checked this, Google says 90%.

**Efficiency in transport**: Not covered directly but I wondered how to compare various modes of transportation. The result is my note on [[Efficiency of transportation modes]].

**Efficiency gains without drastic changes**: We tend to underrate  and under report incremental improvements as key components of an invention. The first steam engine in the 18th century had a 1% efficiency. Watt's improvements doubled it to just 2%. But then subsequent unnamed inventions made efficiency rise to 8%.

Modern gasoline engines are substantially more efficient (usually 30-35% efficiency). Diesel is a bit better, around 45% efficient.

# Economic transitions
There is no clear marker for completed economic transition. For demographics, the transition happens when the birth rate plummeted below replacement. For energy, a transition happened when a country fully switches from plant based fuels.

**Growth is slowing**: Also, GDP over time curves appear as S curves with inflection points in the recent past for most developed countries. This means growth is slowing. However, it's unclear if this GDP stat can be trusted.

One economic transition model:

1. Primary markets: focus on raw materials.
2. Secondary markets: focus on refining the materials, creating goods from them.
3. Tertiary markets: everything else that meets consumer demands. Includes services.

Primitive societies are heavily skewed towards primary markets. As societies progress, they tend to shift to tertiary markets, focusing on services. Here's the graph for the US:

Another economic transition involves more people traveling further. This includes for work commutes as well as travel for leisure. Since 1800, people travel an order of magnitudes more for work than before.

**Electronics are surprisingly energy intensive**: Total energy costs to manufacture all electronics (computers, phones etc) was 1 exajoule (EJ). Compared to all cars at 7EJ. This despite the fact that all cars manufactured weigh 100x as much. Why? Partly due to planned obsolescence and rapid improvement of electronics. (I really should strive to [[Buy it for life]] with these electronics devices as much as possible. Optimize for longevity. Including my current iPhone. It’s just wasteful otherwise.)

# Climate transitions
Interesting foray into anthropogenic climate change from pre-modern humans:

1. Impact of runaway fires from cooking accidents
2. Extinction of mega fauna due to migrating hunters (and climate changes)
3. Impact of early farming on soil PH and other indicators
4. Deforestation

**Forest density on ice-free land**: In terms of tree cover, the metric is mainly forests as measured by sufficient tree density on ice free land. So that means you can take a country and divide its total land by total ice-free land by the percentage of that ice-free land that has forest on it. By this metric most developed world countries have increasing tree cover. And furthermore as climate reduces the amount of ice covered land because of warming, this metric will increase further.

Anyway things are looking pretty dicey.

And we have to reduce CO2 impacts pronto:

> According to the latest available science, achieving the long-term temperature goal would require global greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2020 and subsequently be reduced to zero before the end of the century. To limit warming to 1.5°C, this reduction to zero must take place around 2050

But Smil doesn't think this future is likely, because there's really no reason to imagine it would be so. We're still increasing the absolute amount of CO2 emissions. The relative ratio of fossil fuels is declining, but the absolute amount of energy generated is increasing. The population is still projected to keep growing to 9 B by 2050. And as countries in Asia and Africa become more prosperous (hopefully), the energy footprints will increase. Per capita, the middle class in America take 500 GJ per year, compared to per capita in the developing world at 20 GJ per year, an order of magnitude less.

(Kinda bored of the environment section, moving on)

# Conclusion
Smil is highly critical of singularity believers like Ray Kurzweil. He’s also critical of “endless progress” narratives like those of Steven Pinker. And those that try to thread the needle between the two like Noah Yuval Harari (see [[Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari]]).

Instead Smil aligns himself in between techno optimists and systems thinkers with an understanding of natural limits like Meadows (see [[Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows]]).

Rather than make predictions, Smil attempts to give a lower bound on the fastest possible time to make future transitions.

Projections of population are still like 9+ billion for 2050. These projections may be conservative but still likely to be wrong. Even though they are on S curves and not naive projections, S curves are hard to predict (see [[Forecasting s-curves is hard]]). And also, this does not take into account any discontinuous events and black swans.

Random things to look into:

- **Pumping water up-hill as giant battery**: Apparently the efficiency of storage of a large water reservoir that is artificially pumped up is extremely good, an only 25% loss from this, and stores energy extremely well. Far better than any chemical battery could.
- Look for energy density comparison (in watts per kg) of batteries versus kerosene for air travel and diesel for large naval engines.
- Apparently the energy footprint of wood vs plastic is heavily in favor of wood. What are the implications of that?

**Collective action problems**: The global dysfunction in the back of global wisdom Homosapien sapiens is a major barrier to reducing climate impact. In general the collective action problem is basically unsolved as we can see in the 21st-century. Related to [[Collective action problems aka social dilemmas]].

Smil ends with a #2x2:

    |            | Simplicity     | Complexity          |
    | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
    | Minimalism |                | Smil's prescription |
    | Maximalism | High modernism |                     |

Complexity:

- Favor a multitude of approaches rather than relying on a single perfect solution (eg. No magic geo engineering bullet)
- No place for a priori ideological purity. No insistence on what is best. Pragmatism (eg. Open to nuclear)
- A hyper-focus on electrification may be over doing it (ahem [[Rewiring America by Saul Griffith]]). Avoid killing hydrogen vehicles by overtly favoring EVs with excessive rebates and ownership targets.

Minimalism:

- Systemic small changes can help a lot. Not all fruits need to be available year round. Not all cars need to be SUVs.

Not sure how I got suckered into reading this. It must have appealed to some
deepseated prepper instincts in me. Provenance aside, this prepper book started
off strong, rejecting the typical prepper tropes of guns, generators, and glory.

Two useful things I got from this book:

1. A nudge to try to scenario plan some possible near future disasters and have
   a basic plan of action.
2. A reminder to check on some of the rudimentary gear I have in the house and
   in the car (eg. water, basic food supplies).

January 2022

# Strong world building

- Reliable phone-computers designed to last a lifetime
- Slow reveal of what the world is like, and what "Post-Transition" means
- Vivid descriptions of ruins of modernity ("Factory Age")

> Factory Age ruins looked the same. Hulking towers of boxes, bolts, and tubes. Brutal. Utilitarian. Visually at odds with the thriving flora now laying claim to the rusted corpse.

- "Tea Monks", basically traveling tea merchant-shrinks. Great concept!
- Original pantheon of gods, quite mysterious. Well written slow reveal towards the end segment about the Hermitage.
- Loved the robots that have a finite lifespan, but create new robots out of spare parts ("wild-built")

> I guess you’d say family tree is comprised of many wild-built individuals, descended in total from”—the robot counted on its fingertips—“sixteen factory originals.”

- Loved the robot names, and how they are perhaps more closely integrated into nature than humans.
- Excellent low tech robot message boards.


# Writing and style

- Some cringe-worthy writing that reads a bit like fan fiction.
- Some overly florid sentences, for example:

> Sun cascaded through the hole cut in the canopy, creating a bountiful column of light that played pleasingly with the butter-colored paving inlaid with vibrant stones.

- Prolific use of "they" pronouns which I found awkward. Maybe a matter of habit? It was the first book in which this really stood out to me:

> Ms. Jules was the first to arrive, as always. Dex smiled to themself as she approached

- Character development a bit weak. Dex seems like an angsty teenager without much depth. Is this young adult writing? I think no, given the prolific cursing towards the end.


# Strong ecosystem musings

- I'm a bit obsessed by this idea that [[Subsystems that integrate conflict can lead to resilient systems]], and this fragment resonated with me:

> It must have been such a relief to be free of predators and eat whatever the hell you wanted. But that was the exact opposite of what the ecosystem needed. The ecosystem required the elk to be afraid in order to stay in balance. But elk don’t want to be afraid. Fear is miserable, as is pain. As is hunger. Every animal is hardwired to do absolutely anything to stop those feelings as fast as possible. We’re all just trying to be comfortable, and well fed, and unafraid. It wasn’t the elk’s fault. The elk just wanted to relax.” Dex nodded at the ruined factory. “And the people who made places like this weren’t at fault either—at least, not at first. They just wanted to be comfortable. They wanted their children to live past the age of five. They wanted everything to stop being so fucking hard. Any animal would do the same—and they do, if given the chance.” “Just like the elk.”
