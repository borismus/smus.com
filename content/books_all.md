Another GB recommendation that I really enjoyed. It's hard to summarize this book succinctly since it is such a potpourri of different fields and ideas.

# A different lens on Evolution

> Evolution is the ultimate treasure hunter, searching for nothing and finding everything

Evolution works under a constraint: whatever it produces must survive to reproduce. "Survival of the fittest" is the most popular conception of this process but does not capture any nuance. 

> The problem with competition as a general explanation for creativity is that it usually drives towards everything converging to the best. Selection is not really a creative force: It focuses and optimizes, and ultimately restricts exploration

Forces at play in evolution:

- Competition doesn't actually increase interestingness, but enforces the constraint of genetic survival.
- Genetic drift is the process by which frequency of alleles changes over time as a result of luck. If a given trait doesn’t affect an organism’s ability to survive or reproduce (for example, the color of an organism’s bones), then natural selection will not direct that trait in one way or another, and its evolution will instead drift. 
- Exaptation is the process of co-option of an evolved ability to do something else. For example, feathers first evolved in dinosaurs, where they helped to regulate temperature. Only later did evolution exploit them as a stepping stone to flight. 
- Niche finding is a way to shield an organism from competition. If an organism can make a living in a new way, then it has effectively founded its own niche. A new niche often makes founding newer niches possible, and such newer niches often lead to even newer ones.

As much as I disliked [[Finite and Infinite Games]], this discussion of evolution reminds me of it a bit. The only goal of an infinite game is to keep playing.

In an interesting twist, even our human inventions can be considered an evolutionary process since they were created by us, the products of evolution.

> The bottom line is that many of our greatest engineering aspirations—such as flight, solar power, artificial intelligence—were not the explicit objective of evolution, though it created all of them.


# Invention and stepping stones

A key metaphor often used to explain non-objective search processes is that of crossing a lake using stepping stones in dense fog.

> Because of the fog, you don’t know where either path leads. For all you know, one might lead you to a dead end while the other eventually might reach the other side of the lake. 

The dense fog is a great metaphor for [[Bounded rationality]]. The stepping stones are a good metaphor for the idea of the [[Adjacent possible]]. Each stepping stone must also be stable to support your weight as you cross, which is a great metaphor for [[Stable intermediate forms]].

> If we really behave as treasure hunters and stepping stone collectors, then the only important thing about a stepping stone is that it leads to more stepping stones, period.

The authors make sweeping claims like the following:

> Almost no prerequisite to any major invention was invented with that invention in mind.

[[Profiles of the Future]] makes a distinction between expected and unexpected inventions. This book's framework applies most clearly to unexpected inventions (eg. nuclear energy). These unexpected inventions are shrouded by fog. They are too many stepping stones away to be seen. 

Expected inventions (eg. flying machines) fall less neatly into this metaphor. They are like hills above the fog, but you can't quite figure out the path to get there. On the other hand, once you get close enough to that hill, something that was completely out of reach becomes attainable.

This idea of invention as a process of groping for the next stone in the dense fog makes it clear that learnings from the history of science are inherently limited. Again that McLuhan quote about walking backwards into the future comes to mind.

> Contrary to popular belief, great inventors don’t peer into the distant future. A false visionary might try to look past the horizon, but a true innovator looks nearby for the next stepping stone. The successful inventor asks where we can get from here rather than how we can get there. It’s a subtle yet profound difference. Instead of wasting effort on far-off grandiose visions, they concentrate on the edge of what’s possible today.

This reminds me of my [[Asimov's Tech Tree]] project, and that I really should re-think it as follows. Consider an impactful modern invention and work backwards through all of the inventions its inventors were inspired by. Then repeat this process, creating a tree culminating in this invention. This view would serve to illustrate the many surprising new horizons that one invention enables. Examples include the way that looms and vacuum tubes lead to computers, and smartphones led to better batteries, and better batteries led to electric cars. Authors included a few other uncited example I found interesting:

> For example, the space race yielded innovations like cochlear implants, memory foam mattresses, freeze-dried food, and improved emergency blankets.

In many cases, the inventor is driven by a search for the interesting and novel. Art often follows this pattern too, since it is more often done for its own sake. This is a very fluid process involving a lot of gut feeling, hunches and intuition. As many inventors do this, the process compounds.

> The important point is that novelty (and interestingness) can compound over time by continually making new things possible.


# Picbreeder and other open-ended search applications

The authors rely mostly on Picbreeder, but also on other projects from their research on open-endedness to make their point, which can be boiled down to this:

> The more troubling lesson is that objective-driven search is sometimes embarrassingly incompetent.

They built a walking robot simulator and compared optimization to open-ended search. They found that the robot that tried to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply tried to do something novel again and again. They explain it like this:

> Falling down and kicking your legs may be a better stepping stone than trying to take a step (because kicking your legs is the foundation of oscillation, which is how walking works), but if walking is the objective, falling down is considered one of the worst things you can do.

They built a maze solver which would take considerably longer to solve mazes that were deceptive, meaning that they had deliberate dead-ends.

Images in [Picbreeder](http://picbreeder.org/) are generated from a DNA-like code which can *mutate* to create a different but related images. Following the evolution analogy, visitors to the website can vote on images as a form of *selection*. 

I did something similar with [[Evogami]], but with a much simpler mapping from DNA to object.

These examples are all really neat, but all deal with very specific domains: simulated walking robots, mazes, images, simulated paper. How to go from these narrow fields to something as all-encompassing as evolution remains unclear to me.

# Evolution tends towards complexity

The authors pose a good question: if single celled bacteria can do the job of reproducing, why bother creating more complex offspring?

> all organisms begin their life as single cells and end up reproducing to create offspring who also start as single cells—and this simple strategy for reproduction is effective—what objective utility is there in doing the same thing, but in more and more complicated ways?

By viewing evolution as an open-ended search process, you end up with complexity necessarily.

> As Stephen Jay Gould has pointed out in evolution, once all the simple ways to live are exhausted, the only way to create a new species or niche is to become more complex

# Strange vibes and nitpicks

> In a sense, over eons our bodies have become a kind of encyclopedia of facts about the universe in which they exist. Eyes represent the presence of light in the universe. Ears signify mechanical vibration. Legs are reflections of gravity, and lungs of oxygen.

This is suspicious. Most organs in the body are pretty mysterious from this perspective. 

A lot of this book rails against [[Perils of optimization]] and warns about maximizing meaningless metrics, along the lines of the [[McNamara Fallacy - choose meaningful metrics]] and the infamous cobra breeding story associated with [[Goodhart's law - indicators will be gamed]]. This reminds me a lot of Illich and the [[Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization]] discussion.

> You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America: school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, anything that a politician can run on, anything that someone can get a promotion on. And as soon as you invent that statistical category, fifty people in that institution will be at work trying to figure out a way to make it look as if progress is occurring when actually none is.



How to Take Smart Notes
===

Zettelkasten Method, In Praise of Niklas Luhmann, or Ode To The Slip-box.

The Roam cult sprang out of a practice called Zettelkasten. I refuse to join the cult, but see great value in cross-linked note taking practice. So far my tool of choice is Obsidian, mainly because I like plaintext. This book introduces the Zettel method.

> It is not possible to think systematically without writing - Niklas Luhmann

**Tools for your own thoughts**: Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” “No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.”

**A mirror of your brain**: These notes are not meant for external consumption. They are meant to be a reflection and formalization of your thoughts. As you think about a topic, your mental model of the topic evolves, as does this collection of interlinked notes. Even if your memory fades, you can return to your notes and continue where you left off.

**A communication partner**: The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to?

**Integrate seemingly unrelated sources**: This is especially powerful as a way to integrate learnings from multiple sources into one place. "When we turn to the slip-box, its inner connectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts." Read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.

**Same format, same place**: Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. No underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. Write brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. 

**Keep notes short**: By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling. This will also allow for more ready interconnections.

**Avoid premature linearization**: ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” Prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes achieves the opposite of what teachers intend to do. The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. 

**Feedback loops emerge**: The addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas. The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. It is such an important skill to see differences between seemingly similar concepts, or connections between seemingly different ideas.

**Take it slow**: it takes time to evolve any idea, and this is another benefit of the slip-box. Related to [[Slow hunch]]. Taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place.

**Work on many ideas in parallel**: Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.

**Don't force a direction**: Luhmann’s answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities.

**Publishing by finding a path in the graph**: once you have this densely linked note cloud, and you want to cobble together an idea for others to consume, you weave a path through your graph and create a linear narrative. "We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts."


Three kinds of notes:

1. Temporary notes: which are designed to be processed and converted into something more permanent.
2. Permanent notes: (aka Matuschak's Evergreen Notes) contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way.
3. Project notes: project specific, should theoretically be kept in a separate place.

General reasons for keeping notes:

- [We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)
- Zeigarnik effect
- Charles Darwin forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories.
- Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it. Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture.

> “On one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that’s important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both … The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” - Jeremy Dean


Thinking in Systems: A Primer
===

cover: /assets/book-covers/thinking-in-systems.jpg

Thanks to a book club at work, I finally read this legendary book.

A system is a set of entities interconnected to produce behavior over time in response to external events. For example, a slinky's behavior lies within the slinky itself. 

Modernist thinking tends to like simple causal connections. However reality is complex. Systems thinking is an interesting and valuable lens that complements high modernism. 

One way of looking at systems thinking is as a formalization of folk wisdom:

- a stitch in time saves nine
- the rich get richer, the poor get poorer
- don't put all of your eggs in one basket

# What are systems?

Systems have:

- discrete parts
- parts that interact with one another
- parts which together produce an effect that is different than each interaction

“You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand “and.” - Sufi teaching story

System components in order of importance:

- purpose / function
- interconnections 
- elements (often interchangeable, eg. employees)

Systems are composed of stocks and of flows. Stocks are the amount of a thing. Flows are the increases or decreases of said thing. Think of a bathtub with a faucet and a drain. The water in the bathtub is the stock. The faucet is the flow of water in. The drain is the flow of water out. Flows can change quickly: you can shut on and off the faucet, plug the drain. Stocks change slowly and act as buffers: even if you open the drain completely, it will still take a minute for the water to vanish.

Types of feedback loops:

- Amplifying feedback loop: the more stock there is, the higher the flow.
- Balancing feedback loop: attempts to move stock to a desired state.

Real world systems are affected by multiple feedback loops simultaneously.

# One stock systems

## Two balancing loops (eg. Thermostat)

Stock: temperature.
1. Balancing 1: Exterior temperature cools the room to be the same temperature as outside, flow is tempered by insulation, air gaps, etc.
2. Balancing 2: Heater warms the room until it is the temperature set on the thermostat.

## One amplifying and one balancing loop (eg. Population Growth)

Stock: population.
1. Amplifying: the more people there are, the more people are born. 
2. Balancing: people don't live forever. There's a death rate.

Ultimate behavior will depend on which of the two dominates. If reinforcing dominates, end up with exponential growth. Many other examples like this, such as capital growth, where the more capital you have, the more you can make, but there's also depreciation costs.

# Two stock systems

## Renewable stock constrained by non-renewable stock  (eg. Coal Mining)

Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.

Stock 2: Coal.
1. Balancing: as the coal mine depletes, it becomes harder to extract the last bits of coal. 

## Renewable stock backed by renewable resource (eg. Fishing) 

Stock 1: Capital.
1. Amplifying: the more capital, the more ability to build coal mines.
2. Balancing: the more coal mines, the more upkeep for these mines.

Stock 2: Fish.
1. Amplifying: the more fish there are, the more fish are born.
2. Balancing: as the population dwindles, it becomes harder to find the last fish. 


# Great insights

**Constrained by stocks vs. flows**: non-renewable resources are constrained by stocks. Renewable resources are constrained by flows. 

**Stocks act as buffers**: rivers often flood because flow >> stock. Lakes rarely do because flow << stock. 

**Delays really matter** in reality many of these loops are driven by information that is delayed. This results in oscillations.

**Stable intermediate forms**: another important concept.  Hierarchies mean that there are independent sub-systems which are independently stable. This enables a rise in complexity. 

**Limiting factors** are an intuitive but important idea. A systems is affected by the stock that is in least supply. As a system grows, the most limiting stock may change. 

**Resilience involves many balancing loops**, most of which are inactive most of the time. Example: under normal circumstances, you don't sweat or shiver. But without these abilities you would be far less resilient.

**Dominant loops** complex systems are made of multiple feedback loops, and which loop dominates the others makes a big difference. For example, in a population grouwth system, if the amplifying loop dominates, the population will grow exponentially, but if the balancing loop dominates, it will shrink.

# Stray thoughts

Firstly, what a great collection of insights! But to call it a coherent book is a bit generous. I feel like it's not well structured, and found myself picking out nuggets rather than being swept away by a coherent narrative.

It’s hard to understand as an audio book. Need visual and ideally interactive diagrams. 

Systems thinking is a great technique for CEOs, businessmen, macroeconomists. It's less clear how a pleb like me might apply it. But it's still interesting!

It would be worthwhile to contrast the causal diagrams of the sort Judea Pearl champions with these systems feedback loop diagrams.

> Praise ignorance, for what man has not encountered he has not destroyed. - Wendell Berry

# Traps and remedies

Systems have common failure modes. Here are some of the ones I found novel. The remedies are often easier said than done.

**Policy resistance**. many actors are all invested in an equilibrium involving one stock. Each pulls the supply up and down to their own benefit. Everyone exerts a lot of effort but achieves little. 
Remedy: let go. Find another thing all parties can agree on. 

**Tragedy of the commons**, a common resource or sink is overused by each user, leading to ultimate ruin because of erosion effects. The term was coined much later than I thought: in 1968. 
Remedy: either apply pressure appealing to morality/decency/religion, split and privatize the commons, or impose penalties for overuse.  

**Drift to low performance**, a gradual degradation in quality because of a moving performance goal. If quality is under the bar, the bar is set lower, often excused by sentiment like "it's not that much worse than last year", etc.
Remedy: Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Invert the pattern and set up a drift toward high performance.

**Escalation**. Cycles of violence in conflicts between countries. Negative political ad campaigns that render both candidates unpalatable.
Remedy: disarmament. This can be unilateral or mutually agreed upon, but the latter requires mediation. 

**Success to the successful** is a common situation. The more money you have, the more of it you can make through investments, etc. 
Remedy: Jubilee? Potlatch? Antitrust laws? Estate taxes?

**Dependence**, including personal addiction, but many other things. Societal dependence on institutions like healthcare, etc. 
Remedy: focus on long-term restructuring rather than short-term relief.

**Rule beating**. Example: spending all available budget just to ensure that next years isn’t reduced. Example: only slowing down if there's a police car nearby.
Remedy: redesign the rules!

**Wrong goal**, a common situation where a system pursues a goal that does not actually reflect desired outcomes. Reminds a lot of [[McNamara Fallacy]]
Remedy: 

# Leverage points 

Most attributes of the system are effectively immutable. Structure of the flows is often physical. Delays are often unavoidable. Information flows in feedback systems are where most leverage lies.  

Unbridled growth with an amplifying loop is rare because such systems quickly lead to either:
- Exhaustion of resources (eg. No more bodies to infect)
- Balancing loop dominates (eg. Greater precautions and PPE)

**Slowing growth may bring stability to a system**. Reminds me of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/hundredrabbits/status/1357764199015849984):

> For every hundred people telling us to "just install more solar panels", only one person will consider ways to reduce power usage.

**Make invisible information visible**. During the oil embargo in 1970, the Dutch began to pay attention to power consumption. Some houses mysteriously seemed to use 30% less power than others. The difference was in location of the power meter. Those with low power usage had meter in the lobby. Others had the meter in the basement.

**Re-write the rules**. Interventions into the system's rules are very effective. This explains why lobbyists are powerful. 

**Encourage self organization**: allowing a system to self organize is extremely powerful. But this may lead to unknown conclusions, so is not well loved by those in power. 

**Goals matter**. What is the ultimate goal of the system? What’s the goal of goog? What’s the priority order of many competing goals? Sometimes a leader can do this. Hitler profoundly changed the goals of Germany in the 1930s. Reagan changed the American ethos from “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.” to “Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.”

> “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” - St Exupery

**Paradigm shifts and meta paradigm awareness**. We live in a world with many unstated assumptions, hidden goals, biases. Changing these is the higest leverage point.

> There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”


Sid Meier's Memoir!
===

cover: /assets/book-covers/sid-meier-memoir.jpg

MJ recommended I pick up this book. I regret nothing. 

This was a fun look into game development history, narrated by a venerable insider. I remember spending days with AK and MN playing Civ 1 in the mid-90s, and have played every game in the series since.

Billed as a memoir, this book focuses on anecdotes about the games and the game industry, with Sid Meier's personal life taking the backseat. I especially enjoyed the [Nuclear Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi) story. It's such a colorful intersection of a funny premise, computer science, and a hoax.

Sid Meier's taste for non-violent educational simulators is especially compelling, and reading about these games made me really miss them. As a kid, I think Civ sparked my interest in history and war and complex systems. But I was mainly just having a lot of fun! These days playing even one game of Civ is a heavy lift, but maybe it's worth giving Civ Revolutions a look? 

What I loved most about this book was how excited I became about building games again. The intersection of games and education is extremely tricky to pull off, and I would argue that edutainment as a genre has largely failed. The holy grail is to build something that plays like a game, but whets your appetite about something insightful. This is in some sense the opposite of what explorable explanations do, which are often more interactive visualizations than games.

> Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either - Marshal McLuhan

One thing the book lacked was specific learnings and insights into game development. The chapter on the failed dinosaur game came closest, but I would have loved a whole book on this. Here are some final notes:

**Follow your interests**: Sid Meier's games have been driven by his personal interests, at least in retrospect. 

**People hate randomness**: To placate people's busted sense of randomness and overdeveloped sense of fairness, Civ Revolutions had to implement some interesting decisions: any 3:1 battle in favor of human became a guaranteed win. Too many randomly bad outcomes in a row were mitigated.

**Feedback is fact**: If a player is frustrated, this is a fact. It's not just their opinion! If a game is not fun, this is a fact the developer needs to contend with.

**Interesting decisions**: Many of Meier's games rely heavily on decision making. The decisions must be interesting. 'I wonder what would happen next time, if I did it differently?'
