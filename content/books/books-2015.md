In Praise of Idleness by Bertrand Russell
===
posted: December 2015
rating: yes

Fascinating collection of essays. In "In praise of idleness", Russell in 1930
predicts that automation will reduce the working day drastically. If your quota
of 1000 buttons can be fulfilled in 1/10th the time, you should have a lot more
time for pursuing your hobbies. Unfortunately, this never happened.

In one of the essays, he declares himself as a socialist while simultaneously
distancing from Marx, and Russian communism. Essentially, he lays groundwork for
social democracy. His views on socialism are very reasonable and still relevant
today.



Gateway by Frederik Pohl
===
posted: December 2015
rating: yes

Humanity discovers an advanced civilization, which has become extinct, but has
left a mysterious Gateway in our solar system. Gateway is a small world which
houses many ships capable of taking adventurers on missions to undisclosed
locations. The controls are cryptic, but slowly residents of gateways gain a
better understanding of how they work. Gateway is controlled by a conspicuously
evil transnational corporation, which pays prospectors to take dangerous trips
on these ships with the in hopes of discovery. They pay out lucrative bonuses.

The protagonist, an unsympathetic, and cowardly Robinette (aka Bob), comes to
gateway to try to strike it rich. He struggles with his own fears of going on
missions, and falls in love with Klara. Their dysfunctional relationship, his
troubled childhood, and pathological fear is woven deeply into the structure of
the book. Chapters alternate between Bob's memories on Gateway and Bob the rich
ex-prospector getting therapy sessions from a sentient Robo-psychoanalyst on
Earth. Bob's last mission ends in disaster, as he is separated from his beloved
as their ships try to escape from a black hole. Bob returns the sole survivor,
gets an inordinate amount of money from the corporation, but remains forever
unhappy, missing Klara and suffering from immense guilt.

Overall, I liked the book. It was well written and captivating, reminding in some
ways of Robert Heinlein, but maybe a bit more dystopian. There were many
familiar tropes, such as a very interracial cast with exotic combinations of
first and last names, like Dane Metchnikov. Bob's adventures with hot space
babes are also I think a hallmark of this style of science fiction. I also
enjoyed Pohl's excerpts of Gateway public announcements, mission reports and
classifieds littered throughout the book.


Sophie's World by Jostein Gaardner
===
posted: November 2015
rating: yes

I really enjoyed this one. Clearly a novel for kids, this book provides a nice
overview of philosophy. However, it is also quite entertaining. Events center
around Sophie and her mysterious philosophy teacher. Initially I was
disappointed, since it read like a philosophy class given to the reader through
letters sent to Sophie, but as the plot thickened, the format changed to
Socratic dialog.

After a somewhat dry start, it is revealed that in fact the author is himself a
fictional character writing a book to her daughter, which reveals a lot of the
strangeness that happens in Sophie's World. Towards the end, her world becomes
increasingly exciting and fantastical, with cameos from more and more strange
fictional characters, including Nils and the wild geese. And then it unravels,
when Sophie's fictional philosophy teacher reveals to everyone in their world
that they are living inside a fiction book. This self-referential trick reminds of
Borges and Hofstadter.

I was quite impressed that the Gaardner was able to fit a full intro to
philosophy course into a relatively short book, and still make it entertaining.
It passed my bar with flying colors, and I'm keen to give it to Ben. It can be
his high school philosophy class!


The United States and the Middle East (audio)
===
posted: October 2015
rating: no

A historical account of modern middle eastern history from a US lens. Covers the
period between the late Ottoman Empire and September 11th, 2001 and its
aftermath.

I found the course illuminating, with some clarity on various infighting
rivalries within the Muslim world. Also, a recap of Israeli history through an
Arab lens was interesting to hear along with additional details on all the
major wars and their historical impact. I really liked the late 20th century
lens on US presidents as well: fascinating to view it through the middle eastern
lens. 

The lecturer is quite biased toward the Arab states, which is not a stance I am
used to. At the same time, it is clear he tries to moderate himself to better
appeal to a wider liberal audience. The argument that Israel and American
imperialism is largely to blame for problems in the Middle East runs deeply
through the lecturers narrative. And I suppose that this stance is not so
controversial among liberals too!

Often citing nuances like the definition of Jihad, and underplaying ideological
opposition in favor of external factor mentality, the lecturer makes his bias
very clear in parts. The continuous emphasis on the Israeli occupation gets old
fast. But his stance is not so extreme that he denies that there are genuinely
endemic problems, such as bitter infighting, a general reluctance of the Arab
world to come to the aid of the Palestinian cause, and homegrown (i.e. Not
created by the US) terrorists like Osama bin Laden and organizations like Hamas,
though he never actually calls it a terrorist organization. 

Anyway, mixed feeling at the end, since too many of my thoughts were wasted on
decomposing the lecturers bias and not enough spent to process the actual
content. Also, the speaking cadence made it quite hard to listen to. Ended up
going to 1.5x by the end, which I rarely do. 


Science and Human Values
===
posted: September 2015
rating: no

Broznowski tries really hard to impress with his breadth of knowledge. He
constantly drops references to art, literature and philosophy to make his point.
It's as if he is using himself as an example of a scientist who is also well
versed in liberal art (there are dozens of us!!). I found most of the writing to
be very fluffy, deliberately convoluted, and kind of annoying. I had a hard time
finishing despite it being such a short read. I set the book down for a month,
and returned to it later (upon returning from vacation).

In the first part, Broznowski makes the argument that science isn't in and of
itself good or evil, but just a tool. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he
attributes not to the invention of the atomic bomb, but to the politicians that
chose to use it. Seems like a pretty basic argument, but also flawed and not
new. Not being well versed in the philosophy of Science, not in a good position
to judge it.

In the third and final essay, Broznowski considers science as a social
institution, and compares it to the rest of society. This part I thought was
interesting.  Science has many attractive, democratic properties that I agree
could really stand to be ported into other human domains.



Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahnemann & Tversky
===
posted: September 2015
rating: yes

An excellent read. Kahneman basically summarizes his career as a psychologist,
in which he systematically found flaws in human ability to think rationally.
He's a founder of behavioral economics, which describes the ways in which humans
make systematic thinking errors (deviating from "pure" rationality).



Skeptic's Guide to American History (audio)
===
posted: August 2015
rating: yes

Well done overview of American History with a historiographical twist. Reminded
me of Mr. Begin's history classes, but probably a little more sophisticated. I
really liked the lecturer's call to skepticism, which rang throughout, as he
questioned theme after theme of clich√© Americanisms. I really liked his spiral
model of historical progress, and also the fact that he dropped enough
references that I now have plenty of follow-up work to do. A worthwhile course
for any non-American. Buy it on [TTC](http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-skeptic-s-guide-to-american-history.html).

Digital Signal Processing Coursera
===
posted: July 2015
rating: no

<https://class.coursera.org/dsp-004/>

Professors Martin Vetterli & Paolo Prandoni give an in-depth introduction to
digital signals, filtering, etc. A caveat: I only went through the first 10 (out
of 18) days of lectures, and did only some of the homework assignments.

Initially spurred on by a broad interest in music, audio, and sensor processing,
this course served as a very solid theoretical foundation.  The course starts
off with a very dry, theoretical exploration into Hilbert spaces, which served
as an excellent reminder that I can still sort of understand and enjoy
mathematics. However, my somewhat pathetic mathematical abilities were stretched
to their absolute limit by Vetterli's systematic barrage of theory, and I would
have surely given up on day 2 if not for some of those upper year linear algebra
classes (thanks UBC!).

The lecture's first focus is on **how to understand signals**. Still shaky on
some of the theory, the lecture delves deep into the theory of Fourier analysis
and the formal definition of the discrete Fourier analysis and various related
methods like the DTFT. The treatment of the subject is so dry, it's hard to
breathe. Until as if in a sudden rainstorm, the theoretical desert can breathe
again when finally they bring up examples of the STFT, which I have been using
for a while for various audio-related applications at work, without knowing what
it was called.

The next big subject is **transforming signals**, or signal processing.  Here,
the professors introduce LTIs formally, and derive the idea that an impulse
response fully characterizes an LTI. Next they dive into simple filters, FIRs
and IIRs, covering various types of averages, discussing filter stability and
other formal properties. They try to build some intuition about filters from a
frequency-domain perspective, which is very useful to me. Lastly, the subject of
ideal filters is explored, as well as why such filters cannot be implemented in
real life. 

Finally, they discuss how to actually design filters using the z-transform,
whose derivation remains somewhat mysterious to me, which is unfortunately
normal for an engineering course. Prandoni gives a good interpretation for the
pole-zero plot, which is a really elegant way of looking at filters. The lecture
turns practical for a brief moment, when they reveal that implementations
already exist for non-ideal versions of many of these filters and explore a few
differences between Butterworth, Chebyshev and Elliptic low pass filters. They
also talk about FIRs, and I finally understand the jargon of 'taps', which I
just heard about at a lecture held at Noisebridge.

I still struggle to convert block diagrams into equations, but feel like I have
a much better sense of second order IIRs that ship with the Web Audio API.
Overall a mathematically challenging, but interesting class.  I really wish
there was a better way to build intuition for a lot of the theory, though.


Understanding the Secrets of Human Perception (audio)
===
posted: June 2015
rating: yes

<http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/understanding-the-secrets-of-human-perception.html>

Excellent overview of perception. I learned a ton from these lectures, and
really want to enumerate all the illusions and experiments that the lecturer
cites which give insight into the way our senses work. Lots of in-depth material
about our visual system, how we perceive motion, the incredible variety of depth
cues, as well as after-images and color effects. Some senses, like audition,
were largely review for me, but others, like olfaction and taste, were completely
new to me. Multi-modal perception gets especially interesting, the canonical
illusion being the McGurk effect, but there are many more.

This course is much more than just enumerated sensory illusions, though.  The
great thing about it is that Vishton spends a fair amount of time on the general
principles of operation of our brains, from fundamentals of neurons and synapses
to opponent-process theory, which explains a great deal of perception phenomena
across the senses. From a UX and VR perspective, the material in this course is
totally invaluable. 

John Napier - Hands
===
posted: May 2015
rating: yes

Fascinating deep-dive into human hands from many different perspectives:
anatomical, evolutionary, functional and social. The book is packed with facts.
For example, I had no idea the carpal bones were so numerous and complex! Also,
it's nice to understand why human opposition differs from monkeys and the
Opposability Index. Lots of interesting insights into distribution of
handedness, including that certain species of monkeys are predominantly left-handed, which is surprising on several levels. Napier also goes a bit into
fingerprints, basic patterns, and mentioning some relation to worn-off fingerprints in people with Celiac. It was fun to cross-correlate what was written in
the book with my own hands.

Overall a fascinating account and I found good insights from an HCI
perspective. I did think that the second part on social and cultural aspects was
too brief and incomplete.

> With the eye, the hand is our main source of contact with the physical environment. The hand has advantages over the eye because it can observe the environment by means of touch, and having observed it, it can immediately proceed to do something about it. The hand has other great advantages over the eye. It can see around corners, and it can see in the dark.


Vernor Vinge - Rainbow's End
===
posted: April 2015
rating: no

Real science fiction, in a bad way, focusing more on the science than the
fiction, Asimov style. Not that great of a book, underdeveloped characters,
contrived plot. Really felt like it was written by a technologist, unlike say
Bashert by my former CS professor. The main reason I read it was for is focus on
VR, but even for that I got bored about halfway through and had to force myself
to finish.

The library allegory felt too obvious, as if the author was just shoving the out
with the old, in with the new in your face.



Blue Mind
===
posted: March 2015
rating: no

The message was good and clear, but the writing was tedious. Like Gladwell
books, this one could be compressed to a short pamphlet. I liked the distinction
between hedonism and eudaimonia, which was a very ancillary point in the book,
but still new to me. I also liked the blue marble finish. But the meat of the
book consists of a glorified enumeration of activities related to water.
