Is That a Fish in Your Ear? by David Bellos
===
posted: December 26, 2017
rating: no

David Bellos drops many interesting tidbits in this book about translation.
Unfortunately, I feel unlikely to retain most of them. Each chapter stands on
its own, which is both good for piecemeal reading, but also feels disjointed.
The book struggles to tie together into an overall narrative.  The author's
erudition is apparent, dropping a million mostly relevant and interesting
references. Sometimes this digresses into an obsession with word games, and the
references can come off as gratuitous and self-serving. Overall I liked it, but
there were also parts I found suspect.

What follows is a correspondingly disjointed account of what I found interesting
from the book:

*Finding a good match*: Ultimately the goal of a translator is to find a good
match. Nobody ever does word for word translation, but sense for sense to match
the audience and medium. In translation, the things to preserve are information
and force. Not number of words, sentence length, placement of punctuation.
Speech interpreters can’t preserve tone, pitch, facial gestures, stamping of
feet, etc. Hofstadter has a [good
example](http://www.clementmarot.com/MaMignonne.htm).

*Fake translations*: Some authors claim to produce a translation but there is no
original. Don Quixote claims to be a translation from Arabic. Others claim to
produce an original but just translate an existing work (Castle of Otranto).
Sometimes to pass censorship, other times to try on an identity, to come off as
more authentic. Dzhambul Dzhabayev was a folk singer who was “translated” into
Russian but actually written from scratch. Soviet Union sought to translate
great poets from Kazakh, Ingush, Dagestani etc, but had to invent them instead.

*Decorative foreignism*: When translating a character from one language to
another, how do you preserve their cultural essence? One approach is to preserve
interjections (eg. Gregor Samsa would have exclaimed "Ach Gott!"), but this only
works when readers are assumed to know some phrases of the other language, so
only for languages that share history (for English, German & French, but not
Chuvash).

*L1 and L2*: Translating into your own native language (L1) vs. translating from
your native language into one you are less familiar with (L2). Most literature
is L1, but things like Engrish is definitely L2.

*Up vs down translation*: Up refers to higher prestige or more readers. Like
translation into French from Russian during the 19th century. Or anything into
English these days. Down is the opposite: translating the Bible from Hebrew to
anything. Translating up tends to remove all traces of the original culture but
down tends to preserve it because its perceived as important.

*Languages and conquest*: Sumerian was the up translation target for 3000 years.
This despite the fact that Sumer was conquered by Akkad, who decided to keep the
language and culture. Similarly, Greek language and culture became dominant
despite conquest by Rome. So the economic military bad political expansion
doesn’t directly relate to cultural dominance.

> A culturally dominant language is one that maintains significant volumes of
> translation activity between itself and a significant number of languages

*Languages are interesting*: Kuuk Thaayorre from Australia lay out ordered
objects from east to west rather than left to right. In Hopi there’s a concept
of evidentials. Words change depending on whether they are in the field of view.
So “the farmer killed the duck” doesn’t have enough info to translate to Hopi.

*Mistrust and translation*: When British PMs talks to French president they each
bring their own interpreter out of fear of imperfect or deceptive performance.
[Turkish dragomans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragoman) who would make the
Ottoman decrees more palatable to other monarchs. Adage: traddutore/traditore.
(But this may just be a coincidence).

*Asymmetry of translation*: There are few vehicular languages (regional lingua
franca) between which vast majority of translation occurs. There are far more
non-vehicular native tongues. Even among the vehicular there are great
disbalances, eg Swedish gets as much attention as Chinese despite 100x fewer
speakers. English is the dominant language today, 65% of all translations are
from English and 7% are into English. To really do well globally you need to
read and write English.

*Hub languages*: It’s common for English to be used as the inter-language too,
for example for going from Chinese to English to {Finnish, Estonian, Latvian,
etc}. Simultaneous translation also uses a hub and spoke model. Rather than
going N to N languages at the EU, and requiring N^2 interpreters, use a hub
language like German so everyone translates to and from German instead, only
requiring 2N. Bizarre that most translators into English are amateurs, despite
being important in the global translation flow (as a hub language). Translators
into Japanese are revered and have almost author like status.

*Translation vs. language learning*: In India, there was historically very
little translation between regional languages. (Translation is always a crutch
for our inability to quickly learn other languages.)

*Gestures as a language universal*: Moving hands while speaking (not reading
aloud) is done in all languages. Interesting commonality between eating and
speaking, both requiring hands and mouth. Many other examples of universal
gestures: slapping someone on the back, punch to the gut, shrug of shoulders.


Random tidbits:

- Some languages make distinctions between spoken and written words, eg. paroles
  vs mots in French.
- Adair translated Poe's Raven into [The Black Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/AVoid5/comments/5fb8d8/adairs_translation_of_th_ravn_from_a_void_is/)
  without using the letter "e".
- Eskimo has 40 words for snow, but English has 40 words for coffee.


Questionable claims:

- in German, "spoken word" and "written word" are different words. This doesn't
  seem to be true.
- Humans are unique in their aptitude to vocal learning. Also not true: bird
  songs do it, as do cetaceans and some bats.
- Author feels that translation between modalities (eg. book => movie) is about
  as relevant as translating flour into noodles. Cool story.

I end with food for thought:

> Babel tells the wrong story. The most likely original use of human speech was
> to be different, not the same.
> [...]
> Languages merge when peoples do.
> [...]
> Translating is a first step towards civilization.



My Russian Grandmother... by Meir Shalev
===
posted: November 25, 2017
rating: yes

My parents have been longtime Meir Shalev readers, but I haven't gotten around
to reading any of his books yet. Ido's recommendation put me over the edge. I
read "Дело было так" in Russian and was impressed. Shalev is able to take often
mundane family scenes, and spin an incredible story out of them.

The book is written in an almost, but not quite, magical realism style. His
guiding principle is explicitly stated. I’ll call it Shalev’s razor:

> Эта скучная версия для меня неприемлема. Прежде всего, потому, что я не
> впервой сталкиваюсь с такого рода попытками оспаривать истину. А во-вторых,
> потому, что в таких случаях я всегда руководствуюсь проверенным правилом,
> корни которого лежат, кстати, в мире науки, а не в юриспруденции или в
> литературе. Ученые говорят, что, если какое-то явление допускает несколько
> правдоподобных научных объяснений, следует принять самое простое. Аналогично,
> если какая-то история имеет несколько вариантов и все они выглядят истинными,
> в нашей семье предпочитают самый красивый.

Despite the somewhat exotic Israeli moshav setting, I was surprised at how many
things were familiar to me. The re-circulation of familial expressions,
propensity towards hoarding caused by Soviet-levels of hardship, to immigrant
minimalism.  In one word: Russian Jewish family dynamics.

Most importantly, Shalev writes masterfully, and given the Russian topic,
translation into Russian may have even enhanced the experience.


On the Shortness of Life
===
posted: October 13, 2017
rating: yes

Seneca lies at the intersection of Roman history, stoic philosophy and Buddhism.
Despite many endorsements, I haven’t had the time to sit down and read any of
his writings. So I picked up this short volume of three letters, two to his
friends and one to his mother.

There are almost no clarifying notes in the book, no context about Seneca's
life, events he references, or any of the many names he mentions in supporting
his points with exemplars. The Wikipedia page provided some of that, but I
missed having annotations in the book.

Overall the letters are very quotable and read easily, with the exception of a
few convoluted sentences. I was surprised by how modern ancient Rome sounds,
with a surprising plurality of cultures & peoples. Seneca himself was born in
Córdoba and moved to Rome.

> What are Greek cities doing in the midst of barbarian territories? Why do we
> hear the Macedonian language among Indians and Persians? Scythia and all that
> wide region of fierce and untamed tribes reveal Achaean cities established on
> the shores of the Pontus. [...] Tyrians live in Africa, Phoenicians in Spain;
> Greeks penetrated into Gaul and Gauls into Greece; the Pyrenees did not block
> the passage of the Germans...

Much of the letters are dedicated to the fallacy of material attachment:

> Petty is the mind which delights in earthly things: it should be led away to
> those things which appear everywhere equally[...] Fate has cast you into a
> land where the most luxurious shelter is a hut.

Because of the inevitability of loss, Seneca suggests to celebrate that which is
always with you, the human mind:

> Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be
> neither given nor taken away. The world you see, nature's greatest and most
> glorious creation, and the human guide, which gazes and wonders at it, and is
> the most splendid part of it, these are our own everlasting possessions and
> will remain with us as long as we ourselves remain.

Despite great advice, Seneca is often accused of profound hypocrisy because he
himself was a very wealthy man and as a teacher of Emperor Nero, who was famous
for his tyrannical reign. Seneca can also come off very curmudgeonly as he
disparages those that don’t live according to his standards:

> They seek to stock their pretentious kitchens by hunting beyond the Phasis,
> and they aren't ashamed to ask for birds from the Parthians, from whom we have
> not yet exacted vengeance. From all sides they collect everything familiar to
> a fastidious glutton. From the furthest sea is brought food which their
> stomachs, weakened by a voluptuous diet, can scarcely receive. They vomit in
> order to eat, and eat in order to vomit.

Overall a worthy, very quotable read, a peek into the world of Seneca's Rome,
while contemporary sounding in some ways, also quaint and antiquated, for
example in their celestial worldview:

> The sun glides constantly, moving on from place to place, and although it
> revolves with the universe its motion is nevertheless opposite to that of the
> firmament itself: it races through all the signs of the zodiac and never
> stops; [...] All the planets forever move round and pass by: as the
> constraining law of nature has ordained they are borne from point to point.

I’ll have to revisit more of his writings, perhaps Letter to Lucretius next?


Stories of Your Life and Others
===
posted: September 25, 2017
rating: yes

Ted's formula is this:

1. Arrive at an interesting era, event, myth, legend, etc.
2. Come up with an interesting conceptual twist on it.
3. Research the hell out of the above.
4. Write a super engaging and interesting short story, focusing more on the
   human aspect than the technology (soft sci-fi).

**Tower of Babylon** Such a great concept: what was the tower going to be like,
according to the semi mythical Babylonians? That there would be inhabitants of
the tower, regions of intense heat next to the sun, areas where the sun might
shine upward, or shooting stars might hit the tower, all require an incredible
imagination and intimate knowledge of the ancients worldview. All written in a
tone of biblical knowledge: cubits, references to the recent deluge, and the
proper use of the Lord's name. Tim also displays impressive knowledge of ancient
building and mining techniques. This ability to pack all of this imagination,
history, and credibility into a short story, and make it incredibly entertaining
to boot, is very impressive.

**Understand** superintelligent humans? Also interesting and totally original.
Lots of overla with rationalist obsession with superintelligent ais. Chiang
convincingly describes the sorts of discoveries a superintelligent being might
make. Physics unification, broad psychological insights, hacking ability,
fundamental number theory advances. Also interesting is the protagonists (teds?)
fascination with physical self control through mental means which has become an
interest of mine recently. The whole story is incredibly cinematic especially
the last part involving a psychic battle between superintelligent brains.

**Division by Zero** A very experimental format which is presented in triads: 1.
A mathematical fact, 2. A’s prepsective on being terminally depressed due to a
mathematical discovery, 3. B’s perspective on falling out of love with A. My
take from talking with Sarah was this isn’t effective, especially for
non-mathematicians, especially since A is so hard to relate to. But my reading
of the story was that normal people are supposed to relate to B’s experience
(3), and try to infer that the now lost love B had for A mirrors the now lost
love A had for Math. Overall interesting but not my favorite.

**Story of Your Life** The basis for Arrival, which I saw and enjoyed when it
came out. The short story is significantly different from the film, in plot and
feeling. It is much more contemplative, much less action oriented. There is no
global military crisis, no scary alien ship with a mysterious gravitational
field, just quiet contemplation and a lot of Heptapod linguistics. Again, great
concept, and an interesting foray into the complex relationship between language
and thought, where the Sapir wharf hypothesis is taken to an insightful extreme.
I think there’s a lot to find for the free-will skeptic as well. Again, I think
the experimental format (alternating between raising her child, and her work)
had more to offer than I could gleam on my first reading. Definitely worth a
re-read in the future.

**72 letters**

- What is Chartist reform? A British working class movement dating to 1838.
- What’s a cucurbit? A sort of gourd, similar to a cucumber.
- Der Zauberlehring? This is Goethe’s poem “The Sourcerer’s Apprentice”, which
  is the basis for Disney's Fantasia.

Very clever integration of the significance of names and Jewish themes:
Kabbalah, Golems. Again, Ted’s writing is very convincing, as if he is well
studied in the fields he references. Is there a thing called “method writing”,
as in “method acting”? In one interpretative mapping, this story comes off as
transparent. Stratton, the young sculptor (roboticist) is more interested in the
nomenclature (software) of golem-like automata (robots) than he is in the
sculpting (hardware, manufacturing). By the time he grows up, he gets a job at
Coade Manufactory (heh, Code Manufactory! Google?), and is able to automate the
practice of sculpting, by creating automata that can sculpt. His goals are
noble: to make it very cheap to do menial labor and make ordinary people’s lives
better (modern automation). This also gets him noticed by the government, or
perhaps some higher order think-tank (Lord Fieldhurst), who sponsors his
research, but also has a goal of his own: to ensure the survival of humanity
(lots of X-risk problems). Simultaneously, Stratton has to wrangle with
sculptors (manufacturers), who are concerned that automation will take their
jobs away (sound familiar?), and eventually plot to kill him. Lord Fieldhurst
ends up having a darker motive, which isn’t just the survival of humanity but
also to ensure the quality of the human race (harkening to eugenics). An
unexplained element in this view is Roth, a Kabbalist (academic? Religious
leader?), who dies but leaves Stratton a piece of the puzzle to solving his
riddle (general AI?).

**Hell is the Absence of God** the Christian God definitely exists, and this is
constantly re-affirmed when angels come down and meddle in human affairs.
Ultimately this turns out to be almost mundane, since there is no room left for
uncertainty, and thus belief. A Job-like hero is born with a deformity, and
loses his wife to an angelic intervention. Yet he still cant bring himself to
love God enough to be sent to heaven, where he would be reunited with his
beloved wife.  In an odd twist, hell ends up being just like the regular world,
except there is no godly intervention. In other words, hell is like our world.

**Liking what you see: a documentary** We have developed neurostat, a technology
that lets you block certain neural pathways completely, or developing an
“agnosia”. This is being used for blocking the perception of beauty (mostly
facial) in children and young adults, to make them “beauty-blind”, and accept
people for who they are underneath, and not judge them by their appearances.
This is called “calliagnosia”. The story is fascinatingly written as an actual
documentary, with various actors taking their turn to say their piece. At the
center is a college aged girl and her ex-boyfriend, both of whom grew up with
cali. At college she decided to turn it off and realized that she was beautiful,
and her ex-was ugly. Despite this she loves him and wants to get back together
by convincing him to also turn off Cali and seducing him through her beauty.
This ultimately fails, as after turning Cali off, he decides that he isn’t happy
with his own appearance and opts back into Cali. Their love story is punctuated
with a plurality of other voices, from classmates to university presidents to
neuroscientists who provide unique perspectives, explain technical details, etc.
Overall I think the format is effective, presenting the complexity of the issue,
and I’m not left with a strong opinion favoring one side or another. However my
prior is against mental manipulation...




Nothing is True and Everything is Possible

posted: September 12, 2017

I was catching up on [Leningrad][leningrad] while reading this book (thanks Vitya),
and found the combination of the two to be very powerful. The [song about Prada
bags][bag] is great, as are many others, but didn't see easily accessible
English subtitles. I don’t have much to add, but here are some excerpts that I
found to be extremely powerful:

Vivid description of the influx of huge cash in Russia:

> The cash has come so fast, like glitter shaken in a snow globe, that it feels
> totally unreal, not something to hoard and save, but to twirl and dance in
> like feathers in a pillow fight and cut like paper-mache into different,
> quickly changing masks. At 5:00am, the music goes faster and faster, and in
> the throbbing, snowing night the cattle [telki] become the Forbeses and the
> Forbeses cattle, moving so fast now they can only see the traces of themselves
> caught in the strobe across the dance floor.

And the accompanying faux chique of the nouveau riche:

> On the ground floor is a spa done up in a faux Roman style with Doric plaster
> columns and ruins, frequented by languid, leggy girls here to deepen already
> deep tans and have endless manicures and pedicures. The manicures are
> elaborate: rainbow-colored, multilayered, glitter-dusted designs of little
> hearts and flowers, so much brighter than the girls’ bored eyes, as if they
> pour all their utopias into the tiny spaces of their nails.

Mom and Galia’s Forum experience was probably the Landmark Forum, which is a
close relative of the Lifespring movement, which Pomerantsev highlights in his
book, as a potential cause of depression and suicide for several models featured
in the book. These organizations terrify me.

The topic of Russia fascinates me not just because of multiple generations of my
ancestors living there, but also as a view into human nature, perhaps at its
most extreme.

> This has always been the paradox of the new Russian nationalism: on one hand
> wanting to conquer all regions around, on the other wanting an ethnically pure
> great power. And all that comes out of this confusion is an ever-growing
> anger.

Well described profoundly split personality of Russian people: it’s not that
some are dissidents and others are believers, it’s that a single person can
embody both, at different times. This is a super fascinating of people In
general.

> The great drama of Russia is not the "transition" between communism and
> capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that
> during the final decades of the USSR, no one believed in communism and yet

> sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism— and keep their money and
> families in London. All cultures have differences between “private" and
> "public" selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be extreme.

Also terrifyingly effective is his depiction of bureaucrats:

> They conjure motions to “ban untraditional sex” or “ban English words”— and to
> sanction Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Glance through the careers of these new

> Because isn’t some sort of madness implicit in the system?

Peter ends with a warning, uttered by a British investor in Russia, which
resonates strongly with me:

> We used to have this self-centered idea that western democracies were the end
> of evolution, and we’re dealing from a position of strength, and people are
> becoming like us. It’s not this way. The whole of western civilization, "this

Super well written, incredibly engaging throughout. Incredibly so for
non-fiction about a depressing topic. Much more entertaining than Gessen’s
barrage of pessimism.

Benjamin Franklin: An American Life
===
posted: August 24, 2017
rating: no

I read Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography, which I recalled enjoying
thoroughly. Having always been an uncritical fan of Benjamin Franklin (BF), I
decided to remedy that. I found the book engaging at first, as his origin story
was revealed. BF's middle age spanned several hundred pages, and really dragged
on. The sheer number of names dropped by Isaacson made this especially
challenging. I abandoned the book for several months, only to come back to it in
August.  The last third of the book picked up again, as we returned to actually
interesting historical events (US independence, the war, the American
Constitution, etc). The conclusion, a whirlwind account of how public opinion on
BF shifted over history, was masterfully written, but overall the book is too
long and detailed for my taste.

Franklin's pragmatism is super appealing to me: "God is very good to us. Let us
show our sense if His goodness by continuing to do good to our fellow
creatures". A few interesting factoids from his early life:

- BF believed in Deism: a compelling alternative to atheism (agnosticism is too
  weak a statement to be in the running).
- His activism around constructing libraries was super compelling.
- His Junta developed in parallel to the Freemasonry movement.
- BF eventually joined the masons and became head of their chapter in
  Philadelphia.

For me personally, BF's least appealing trait was his consistent inability to
maintain long lasting personal relationships. Franklin's biggest strength is
being a well rounded humanist, but also a prolific inventor. Here is a random
sample of his inventions:

- A table that could be raised and lowered
- Using oil to calm turbulent water
- An improved convection oven
- How to ride the Gulf Stream, and what causes it
- Methods for removing smoke from a fireplace (while cooking)
- A mechanical arm to retrieve books from upper shelves in a tall bookcase
- Lightning rods

I also found Isaacson's coverage around pre-constitutional debates very
interesting. Here's a sampling of the issues, and where Franklin landed:

- Should there be one chamber or two (two, BF wanted one)
- Should there be a president or an executive council (president, BF wanted council)
- Should the president be paid (yes, BF wanted no)
- Should judges be elected or appointed (appointed, BF wanted elected)
- Should there be term limits on the president? (yes, like BF wanted)
- Should the president be impeachable (yes, like BF wanted)
- Should representatives be elected based on popular vote or state appointment?
  (it's complicated...)

At least in word, Franklin was humble and pragmatic:

> ... having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged, by
> better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on
> important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It
> is therefore that, the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own
> judgement and pay more respect to the judgement of others.

And created environments for others to do the same:

> “Franklin’s shaded garden was a place where controversies could be cooled.”

His epitaph, attributed to a French minister, says it all: eripuit coelo fulmen
sceptrumque tyrannis ("He seized lightning from the heavens and the scepter from
tyrants").


Whole Earth Discipline by Stewart Brand
===
posted: July 12, 2017
rating: yes

In the spirit of the Whole Earth Catalog, this book reads more like an extended
blog post than a non-fiction book, mainly because it covers so much material at
a pretty high level. I feel like each chapter is a well crafted summary of at
least five other books cited in the end-notes. This is not a complaint;
synthesis is where Stewart Brand shines.

The basic thesis of the book is this:

- Cities, nuclear power, and genetic engineering are good for the environment.
- Geoengineering is probably necessary to mitigate global warming.

## About cities

- Slums are vibrant, starting flimsy but then becoming a lot more substantial.
  In India, slums are 1/6 of GDP! Informal economy is huge.
- 80-90% of GNP growth happens in cities. Cities only take up 2.8% of the
  world’s landmass, but house half of its people. Birth rate goes down.
- Geoff West on [Kleiber’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law):
  Individual productivity rises superlinearly (eg. When a city doubles in size,
  productivity increases more than 2x). Note that this is different for
  companies, and for individuals.
- Brand claims the Russian birth rate is 1.14, and the average Russian woman has
  seven abortions. This seems too high, and more recent data says a birth rate
  of 1.4, but apparently Russia does have the highest number of abortions per
  woman of child bearing age.
- Density => Green. NYC is the greenest city in the US by many metrics.


## About nuclear power

- Baseload refers to a solid guaranteed source of power that can operate at all
  times and doesn’t require storage. Wind and solar have that down side.
- If all of the energy you were to use in a life time (1 GW year), were stored,
  it would amount to 20 tons if nuclear (stored in dry storage casks), and 8
  million tons (directly into the air) if coal. Nuclear is on par
  (environmentally) with solar and wind.
- Apparently no birth defects are attributed to Chernobyl or to Hiroshima. Also
  Chernobyl death count is much lower than I expected, at 56. Brand glosses over
  any cancer related deaths, which according to wikipedia are ~4,000.
- Main cost of Chernobyl and nuclear in general (except Japan bombs) fear of
  radiation takes a much bigger toll than the radiation itself.
- Even more crazy is this idea of Hormesis which is that low dose radiation is
  good for you. But this sounds like crockery, highly unverified.
- EPA has very severe thresholds for radiation exposure for people, requiring
  nuclear sites lower exposure to under 15 mrem of radiation per year. But
  this is far lower than background radiation in many places. 284 mrem in
  Connecticut or 364 mrem in Colorado or 13k mrem in Ramsar, Iran.
- Most of France’s energy is provided by Nuclear (54 reactors), and they have
  very clean air.
- Lots of new developments in nuclear reactors, lots more uranium in the soil,
  prospects to use thorium (which can’t be used for weapons?). Also,
  smaller scale underground reactors are coming up.
- In Sweden, 1/3 of the population has toured a nuclear plant. This is a good
  way of increasing public acceptance.

## About genetic engineering

- Mendelian selection has been happening for ages. Chemical mutagenesis and then
  nuclear metagenesis, where plants get exposed to large amounts of radiation in
  order to encourage mutation, has also been common. These approaches are
  random, sometimes cause downsides.
- With GE you can do much more tailored, fine-grained tweaks. “Like getting a
  spouse without in-laws, while breeding is like getting a spouse with a whole
  village”.
- Half of corn in US is GE. Half the sugar comes from GE beets. A quarter of new
  drugs are made with GE. 90% of Hawaiian papayas are GE.
- GE crops are engineered for pest and disease resistance, meaning less
  fertilizer is necessary, which is healthier and better for the environment.
- GE foods are exhaustively vetted for safety, making them safer than
  conventional food. Billions have eaten GE food and not gotten sick.
- Rift between Europeans and Americans. EU simply don’t want to eat GE foods. GE
  is beneficial for farmers, but consumers are opposed out of fear? Again Marin
  county leads the way: “Our children should not be used as guinea pigs for
  genetic engineering”.
- How Monsanto works: glyphosate kills all plants but safe for animals. But
  Monsanto’s seeds are engineered by be glyphosate resistant. So spray
  glyphosate on fields and kill all of the weeds quickly.
- Similar technique involves adding Bacillus thuringenesis (Bt) to crops, which
  is poisonous only to larvae. Bt corn and cotton are examples, and need way
  less pesticides.
- Also with GE you can till less, which keeps carbon naturally stored in the
  earth from escaping.
- Bad PR for Monsanto about enslaving farmers comes from the practice of
  engineering sterility into seeds so that farmers are required to go back to
  Monsanto for fresh seeds every year. But apparently farmers generally buy new
  seeds on a yearly basis anyway (but this begs the question of why Monsanto
  would want to engineer sterility in the first place).
- Good to remember that Monsanto has competitors and that if they end up being
  malicious, farmers can easily find alternatives.
- Also possible to use GE to enhance nutrition in otherwise nutritionally empty
  food. Examples: golden rice augmented with beta carotene, same with
  BioCassava which provides vitamin A, E, iron, zinc, free of cyanide and can
  store longer than regular cassava.
- Overly euro-centric NGOs in Africa (little rain, hot) tend to bring crops that
  thrive in Europe (lots of rain, cold). Also Europe is anti-GE which doesn’t
  help Africa.

## How to mitigate global warming

Renewistan is a hypothetical future dystopia that would result from us fully
replacing conventional energy with renewable energy. This is not sufficiently
efficient to be practical.

1. Steven salter autonomous water particle sprayer with flettner sails. Would
   brighten clouds to offset a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.

2. SO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. This happened naturally due to a volcanic
   explosion at Pinotubo in which 20M tons of so2 reduced earths temperature by
   0.5C.

3. Feed iron to carbon fixing algae to make them bloom. Unclear if this will
   work. Good case: algae sinks to bottom acting like carbon sink. Bad case:
   circulates in food webs near surface and returns to atmosphere.

4. Floating vertical pipes to drive cool nutrient rich water from depths upward,
   while pumping CO<sub>2</sub> and dimethyl sulphide (which makes sun reflective clouds)
   down. Using wave energy to do the work.

5. Mixing non biodegradable biochar with soil you can ensure that the CO<sub>2</sub> within
   it doesn't escape. Essentially you're growing plants which takes CO<sub>2</sub> and then
   burning them into biochar, keeping the c sequestered.

6. Artificial trees that capture a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> a day chemically and use it for
   commercial stuff.

7. Large sunglasses at L1 orbit to reduce the amount of heat from the sun
   directly.

8. CROPS: sequester agricultural residues with bales at the bottom of the ocean.
   (Another idea I've heard is doing something similar but sending the waste to
   space using s railgun)

# Cross cutting ideas

1. Critique of precautionary principle, which is a doctrine against meddling
   regardless of risks and rewards. Fable of the steak knives (formulated by
   Jimmy Wales):

> “You want to design a restaurant, and you think to yourself, “Well, in this
> restaurant we’re going to be serving steak. And since we’re going to be
> serving steak, we’re going to have steak knives, and since we’re going to have
> steak knives, people might stab each other. How do we solve this problem?
> We’re going to have to build cages around each table to make sure no one stabs
> each other.“ - Jimmy Wales

> “Expected benefits from any act are finite and known: “Golden rice will
> prevent blindness in children.” Imagined problems are infinite and unknown:
> “Golden rice might cause poor people to stop eating green vegetables; it might
> lead to excess vitamin A consumption; it might be a Trojan horse for corporate
> takeover; it might cause who knows what prob-­ lems!” In this formulation, no
> good surprises are possible, all bad surprises are probable, and intended
> consequences are never what actually happen”

2. Ideologically motivated environmentalists cause a lot of harm. For example
   Greenpeace’s anti GE activity has harmed developing world, leading to large
   scale famines. At the same time "romantics" are given their due for inspiring
   the masses to care about the environment, yet it's clear why they are at odds
   with science and engineering.

> "It's fortunate that there are so many romantics in the movement, because they
> are the ones who inspire the majority in most developed societies to see
> themselves as environmentalists. But that also means that scientists and their
> perceptions are always in the minority; they are easily ignored, suppressed,
> or demonized when their views don't fit the consensus story line."

Environmentalists were against space exploration but it turned out to be a big
deal because satellites were instrumental for ocean monitoring and the photo of
earth from space motivated huge interest in ecology.

3. Concentrate harm geographically. Cities > sprawl, nuclear waste > coal waste,
   high yield > low yield crop. Wall off the artificial from the natural.

- Fascinating angle on European-native American collision: that the indigenous
  population of the continent fell from 50-100M in 1491 to 7M by 1650? "Far
  from destroying pristine wilderness, Europeans bloodily created it".
  Apparently indigenous agriculture was in 2/3 of the US, coastal forests were
  cut down for farms, salmon nets covered most northwest streams, Indian fires
  abounded. TODO: Read [Charles Mann, New Revelations Before

- Biochar sounds interesting but don't fully understand. Idea: mix charcoal

  apparently creating the biochar is good since it can be made from waste

- Brand seems really confident in our ability to predict potentially negative

  many examples of invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem. Do we know
  enough to fully predict the impact of intervention?

- Crazy thing he mentions early on is the amount of biomass that is human vs
  that is bacterial. See human microbiome project. Apparently our bacteria
  outweigh us. Same with parasites, e.g. There's a parrot with 30 species of
  parasites that live on its wings.

- Check out the [big here quiz](http://kk.org/cooltools/the-big-here-qu/). I

Brand dazzles with an array of convincing arguments. I’d like to read a
similarly researched argument from the other side to see where I land.


On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder
===
posted: June 13, 2017
rating: no

More of a pamphlet than a book, both in brevity and in alarmist urgency.

Structured as a strange combination of trends that lead to tyranny and general
life tips. Dangerous trends include the destruction of institutions and
paramilitary rule. As for life tips, the author suggests reading more books and
longer articles, donating to charities, and having more conversations in person,
and remaining calm in the face of terror.

The last point I think is a good one and I agree that there is good reason to be
deeply concerned about the political impact of a major terror attack on US soil.

Overall quite heavy handed. Despite not calling out Trump by name, some passages
like this one are overly didactic:

> What is patriotism? Let us begin with what patriotism is not. It is not
> patriotic to dodge the draft and to mock war heroes and their families. It is
> not patriotic to discriminate against active-duty members of the armed forces
> in one's companies or to campaign to keep disabled veterans away from one's
> property. It is not patriotic to ... (etc)

Each "It is not patriotic" sentence refers to something deplorable Trump did in
the last 6 months. And it continues for a page and a half. A thought flashed
across my mind: how is this better than reading Twitter?

The author draws many false analogies to Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany.
He then normalizes extremist terror as just another thing by claiming that those
resisting fascists and communist regimes were also billed extremists (therefore
what?). He plays with words, uncharitably redefining a "nationalist" in contrast
to "patriot" as one "that encourages us to be the worst and the tells us we are
the best", whereas the two words are often used interchangeably.

The conclusion starts well written, with choice words criticizing "end of
history" narratives that helped get us here. But ends in conspiratorial hand
wringing.

In liberal cities like Seattle, the opposition is the majority and there are no
signs that things will flip any time soon. Most of Trump's policies are
signaling and most of them are counteracted with opposition signaling. He is an
awful leader for this country and I'm ashamed of his words and actions. But as
for actual policy changes or prosecution of specific people, he has (so far)
been stopped at every turn. I agree that these are unusual times, and that extra
vigilance cannot hurt, but hyperbole can be dangerous too. This book feels like
a classic case of crying wolf. I find it hard to believe that it will stand the
test of time.


Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
===
posted: June 10, 2017
rating: yes

Incredibly vividly written. Fascinating to see the self made struggles of people
that are so fantastically well off.  Very unsympathetic characters throughout,
except for the narrator.

Something about Gatsby's lifestyle reminds me of my time in SF. Large house
parties, loose connections, endless networking and small talk.  There is a
certain aimlessness to it that I found very relatable.



Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse
===
posted: May 2017
rating: no

I was intrigued by the premise of the book, which introduces a theory of games
(emphatically not the game theory of economics), in which there are two kinds of
games: short, well defined finite ones where the goal is to win, and infinite,
rule-bendy ones where the goal is to keep playing. Great premise but I couldn't
get into it.  Despite being only ~100 small, sparse pages, I had to cut it off
after about twenty. Here's why:

> "Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role
> of mother."

Is this profound or what? My impression is that the author is a deliberate
obscurantist. The whole book reads like a collection of Zen koans. But unlike
koans, which are simple on the surface but attempt conceal something profound,
the surface level is also very dense. The author casually cites Plato, Freud,
Hegel Marx, Jesus, Sartre, Thoreau, Shaw, Proust, etc. The book is full of
passages like the above that are meaningless without defining terms precisely.

Further, the author babbles a lot about theory, rarely producing actual examples
of infinite games. Presumably life is an infinite game, but are there other
examples? What good is a grand theoretical framework that only has one instance?
Lastly, given the author's definition, infinite games seem hardly game-like at
all.


Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari
===
posted: May 2017
rating: yes

I decided to read Homo Deus because I enjoyed Harari's previous book, Sapiens.
The first 2/3 of Homo Deus is basically a rehash and more succinct version of
his previous book. Despite the repetition, I got a lot out of it, mainly because
I listened to Sapiens, so my retention was pretty bad. The last third of the
book was very speculative.

Interesting things from the recap:

- In 2016, war killed 120k, crime 500k, suicide 800k, diabetes 1500k.
- Well stated paradox of knowledge using Marx as an example. Specifically
  communist revolutions never came to the western world because its leaders had
  read Marx.
- Also this logic conveniently defends Homo Deus existence as a way of avoiding
  the future it describes. But also of obviating the author from any
  responsibilities. Smart :)
- Big claim that in 1016 Europe people knew what 1050 would be like (but not 2016,
  2050). Not sure if this is just hindsight bias.
- Nice crisp description of intersubjectivity, better than in sapiens.
- Claim: religion is for control, science is for power. I agree, except
  s/science/engineering/.
- The Vatican was once an institution for technological progress, a Silicon Valley
  type institution. Monasteries did contribute quite a bit to tech innovation,
  even recently (e.g. Mendel)

Even in the summary, Harari goes on some bizarre but interesting tangents:

- Several pages railing against lawns. They are purely status symbols and have
  no practical value.
- Snakes as ancestors. Dragons as wise creatures. Rainbow Serpents of Australian
  Aborigines. Eve as a snake. Garden of eden as an anti animist fable.
- The Garden of Woolsthorpe (where Newton's apple accident occurred) as a
  founding Myth paralleling the garden of eden. This is where newton had his
  kinematic revelation. Except rather than being punished for his curiosity like
  Adam and Eve were, we have modern science.
- Why do we have consciousness when there are so many automatic processes that are
  handled by the body and the brain without any conscious intervention?
- Weird and tenuous analogy of gods to corporations. Corporations actually
  produce output like a product or service but gods are purely fictional.
- Judge systems from without. For example a corporation thrives if it makes a lot
  of money. But that's not why corporations exist.

To transition from the summary to the meat of the book (speculating about the
future), Harari rehashes his branches of humanism:

- liberal: equality for all, economically artistically etc
- social: socialism and communism. Deference to the group.
- evolutionary: belief in superiority of some over others.

My critique: this is too broad. Humanism seems to include everything that is
non-religious. Because either God is the main thing or humans are the main
thing. Are there other better alternatives? Maybe with Zen Buddhism?

Harari then dives into an overly stark analysis of the weakness of liberalism.
As if the only US allies were dictators during post war period. Not true! Most
of Europe was liberal. And although the Soviet Union was critical in defeating
Nazi Germany, liberal Allies did play a huge role too. Harari then goes into
counterfactuals, suggesting that social humanism (communism) defeated
evolutionary humanism (Nazism) in World War II, and that the Cold War didn't
turn Hot because of mutually assured destruction due to nukes.

## Last third

The book really begins in Chapter 8, where Harari jumps headlong into future
speculation.  It's unclear to me why Harari jumps to some post humanist fantasy.
Currently we are seeing the resurgence of "evolutionary humanism" in the form of
authoritarian regimes.

Harari is clearly not an expert in AI and overly optimistic about it. He claims
that"computers programmed with ethical algorithms could far more easily conform
to the latest rulings of the international criminal court."

On replacing service type jobs, especially in medicine, over optimism. People
like dealing with people. And the supposedly empathetic machine is still a long
ways off. Even in the case of near perfect replication, I think acknowledging
consciousness and experience on the other side goes a long way.

More reductionist thinking: biology is just an algorithm and we can do
algorithms. Yes it is but the devil is in the details.

He cites a Frey and Osborne study which suggests that all sorts of jobs are
going away. A twenty year horizon cannot reasonably have such precise
probabilities. And many problems with specifics. 98% Sports referee jobs to go
obsolete by 2033? Sure we can tell fowls through video. Who will prevent fights?
Who will make difficult calls? Seems like bullshit.

On self knowledge again Harari goes too far by claiming that your self is the
sum of your biometric data. As long as we don't divulge everything to the
machine, aren't we quite far from this vision? I am surprised that a deep
meditator like the author believes this.

Harari lists several threats to liberalism posed by this hypothetical future
thing:

One threat is that we will lose our agency and become agents of some networked
machine. This is terrifying. We may need some anti-tech revolution to prevent
this. Also it's unclear what the scope would be. I'd like to always be able to
disconnect and go into nature.

Another threat is that the rich will become increasingly intelligent, healthy,
successful, further separating the gap between the rich and the poor.  I believe
that if things get bad enough, the population at large will rebel and
redistribute the spoils more evenly.

Here's why. In established first world countries, the rich know how to behave.
They rarely flaunt their money and mostly blend in with the rest of the world.
I think this is largely a self-preserving strategy. Many of those that don't
follow it aren't respected by giant swaths of the population. For example overly
flashy people are generally considered to be douchebags. Trump is an aberration
and widely hated. Now imagine if he was also some superhuman demigod. Would his
supporters be into that? If a tiny clique of people were visibly richer
healthier, people would rebel.

I think Harari a third point is only viable in an dystopian oligarchy. And if
people have become completely useless, why would some small elite group of
humans still hold the reigns? This scenario folds into the superintellihgence
one.

We use machine strength and machine intelligence augmented tools all the time.
Harari seems to be obsessed with the neural augmentation aspect, but is this
such a game changer?

Good points that are hard to argue against: human loss of smell, attention,
ability to dream. I seek to get it all back. But I wonder: were these all things
that came naturally to everybody in some long forgotten utopia, or did rare
individuals have to work on developing these skills for themselves while the
rest of the population plowed the field or caught the deer?

- Dreaming: It's no accident that Joseph's dream interpretation was so rare and
  that there were commonly priest classes for interfacing with dreams
- Smelling: yes seems likely that the masses of the day: hunters and farmers
  needed this more long ago.
- Attention: also an elite skill I think. We are In an age of distraction but
  attention today is more needed than ever before. Attention for a hunter was
  focused with adrenaline. Focusing otherwise is and probably was rare.

The focus on technology changing our minds and wills seems premature. And by the
way this is why I think SSRIs are a slippery slope. Maybe the google normal
health index can serve as some humanistic baseline for human norms?

The last section is entirely focused on "Dataism". It sounds like he's
describing information theory. I suppose any discipline can already be viewed
through that lens. Except is that activity likely going to produce useful
results? Empirical evidence from science points to no.

Harari claims that the phrase "information wants to be free" means that
the information itself is the actor. This is surprising, since the phrase is not
meant to be taken literally, used as a slogan about increasing human access to
information. A cult of information worship for its own sake? I don't think this
makes sense without actual value to an actual human.

Harari has so far failed to explain who believes in dataism. Maybe some people
in SV appear to, but IoT usually has some actual purpose, like for example,
making things easier to use, or increasing productivity of a farm or factory.
If you lose the thread, you end up with tech for tech's sake (an existing
problem).

Also Harari's stance on the instagram sharing thing is really cynical. Yes
sharing with others is part of it. But many people have taken photos in the
past, for themselves and their friends.  It's clear to me that the value of
Human experience is inherent. Some people are overly addicted to external
validation, but this too is an existing problem.

Throughout the book Harari judiciously uses the word "may". This is good because
man the last third especially is just chock full of wild speculation.  It
strikes me that the way to read this book is as a provocation. Overall I'm left
with the feeling that this was a fast follow for Harari. A lot of the solid
stuff in the first 2/3 of the book is a rehash of Sapiens. The last part was
stimulating but mainly to get me thinking about why I disagree.


Understanding Japan: A Cultural History (audio)
===
posted: May 2017
rating: yes

Overall an engaging lecturer and super interesting subject. Would have greatly
informed my trips to Japan. Most of these are quick notes about things that were
new to me:

Lots about Buddhism:

- There's a super interesting argument that the fact that Shinto traditions are
  completely illogical is proof of the divine origin of those teachings.
- There were multiple streams of Buddhism commonly practices in early Japan. Pure
  Land Buddhism is very similar to Christianity's because of the centrality of
  salvation through belief. Also there are multiple streams of Zen Buddhism. One
  focuses on koans and the other focuses on meditation.
- Key idea of zen gardens is that you get a new view from every step in the
  path. This is a metaphor for human nature, which is prone to seeing the world
  very differently depending on emotional state. Constant reminder about the
  limitation of the senses.
- In Pure Land Buddhism, gardens include a bridge to paradise. Dry landscaping.

Politics:

- "Tycoon" comes from tai + kun, a made up title (great lord) for the Japanese
  Emperor as a result of a Japanese-Korean treaty. It was invented to avoid direct
  vassalage to the Ming.
- Interesting oscillation between isolationism and globalism. 1600-1860 was
  complete isolation. Hardly knew about the pre-WW2 Japan with Manchurian
  ambitions.

Arts

- Apparently the tea ceremony inspired the English Arts and Crafts movement.
  Also a part of minimalism. (Check out Okakuro's "The Book of Tea" from 1906).
- (Check out Nou theater but it's unclear if I'll be able to follow it. Not much
  interest in Kabuki.)
- Haiku is young. Started in 1890. Fascinating idea of pivot words: homonyms that
  can be used just once but translated into multiple of its meanings. Also renga
  is an interesting chain of poems each written by another poet.
- Hokusai invented the comic book. What.

Lecturer provides a good summary of why he is interested in Japan: it's
incredibly interesting and exotic, but still has enough western services.


The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant
===
posted: April 2017
rating: yes

This book attempts to distill authors' previously written and incredibly popular
multi-tome historical "The Story of Civilization" into under 100 pages. Full
disclaimer: I haven't read the original. I found this one is a bit of a mixed
bag. Overall, I say read it, since it's so short (~100 short pages).  I found
the flourishing writing style and strong opinions sometimes leads to funny dated
read. Similar in some ways to Jacob Bronowski writing.


Random but interesting ideas:

- Freedom and equality are at odds.
- Authors seem to rely on group selection. Still unclear what I think about the
  idea.
- Interesting coverage of the great man theory of history. A nod to both the
  causes of greatness in the environment and also personal originality that can
  bridge gaps.
- Also insight into the yin yang nature of liberal vs conservative
  thought.
- Interesting that Rome took 500 years to collapse from its nadir in 60 BCE.
- Revolutions rarely succeed in redistributing wealth, mainly in destroying it.
- In Chapter X, authors express concern about a despot ruining America democracy.

A lot of interesting thinking on morality and history:

- In general the idea that morality follows the times.
- Intimate relationship between Bible and agriculture. Biblical morals developed
  to help with agriculture, and have deteriorated as a result of industry.
- Was every vice once a virtue? Pugnacity, brutality, greed, and sexual readiness
  were virtues for the hunter age.
- The idea that most times in history have been full of sin. Examples from the
  Renaissance.

Some things that felt dated and detracted from the experience:

- The chapters are mostly named "History and ___". This obtuse naming gets old
  quickly, and skimming the contents is completely useless.
- The authors make predictions that geography no longer matters because
  airplanes, completely ignoring reality of efficiency. They end pompously on
  "man, not earth, makes civilization"
- At some points the authors express fear that Catholics will take over US
  politics. This is likely top of mind for the authors writing the book the
  Kennedy era. I looked up the authors' religious affiliations and they come from
  a Jewish background (squee!)

The authors allude to some historical patterns:

- History that is written is different from history that is lived.
- The church as an organization that stands above Christian nation states. Kind
  of like a religious version of the UN. Like an alternative to the international
  system. Except while the International System is really vague and doesn't really
  seem to have much power, the Church worked once.
- Prevalence of the cycle between religion and atheism. And I think that Sam
  Harris is wrong about the end of faith.
- Cycles pervade economic inequality. This has a tendency to
  increase until the poor can't take it anymore and revolt. Or until the ruling
  class realizes and course corrects.
- Now irrelevant but quite prescient that they would apply Hegelian thinking to
  industrialization. Meaning that industrialization is thesis, communism is
  antithesis and now we need a synthesis. (Evidence points to Liberal welfare
  states?)
- Again the idea of compensation and balance in a great quote from Plato
  "dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated fork of
  tyranny and slavery out if the most extreme fork of liberty."
- Monarchy - aristocracy - democracy - dictatorship (and so on). Cycle appears
  over and over in history.

Civilizations don't die completely. There are more readers of Homer today than
ever before.


The Wind's Twelve Quarters by Ursula K. Le Guin
===
posted: March 2017
rating: yes


Each short story explores a novel premise that is vaguely science-fictiony. But
Le Guin's writings favor soft over hard sci-fi, rarely delving into Asimovesque
"gadgeting", mostly focusing on the romantic: emotions, relationships, feelings.
Some of my favorites from the book:

April in Paris: interesting fantasy/sci-fi exploration of the same place over
time. It gets a bit silly in the end, but very memorable. Her obsession with
archaeology is very apparent.

The Masters: the intersection between religion and technology is just always
fascinating. Reminded me a bit of one of my favorites: Canticle for Leibowitz

The Rule of Names: riffing on an interesting premise: nobody is allowed to
reveal your name to anyone. Pure fantasy with wizards.

Nine Lives: what happens when you grow up with/as a group of clones? What's it
like? How do you(s) interact with the world and others? What happens if your
group is split? Fascinating premise and great execution.

Some of her other stories are much less focused on a sci-fi premise, and more
focused on a mental trip and human psychology. She calls them psychomyths.

The Good Trip: close to my heart at the moment, as I worry about my life and
wife. I didn't realize Le Guin was from Portland. How cool!

A Trip to the Head: what if you lost your identity completely (terrifying), but
had the ability to pick one arbitrarily? Not particularly good, but reminded me
of some vague but unpleasant thoughts I had about VR.

I wonder if sf writers write with their future audience in mind. Like how would
their books read after we actually have become an interplanetary species?"


Deep Work by Cal Newport
===
posted: March 2017
rating: yes

Several strategies for deeply working:

- Sabbatical for days
- Regular schedule e.g. Just mornings.
- Attempt to squeeze it in blocks of 90 minutes

Unconscious thought theory. Can you really solve hard problems unconsciously?
Does type 1 thinking have non primal uses?

Evenings are sacred. No work or work email.

General distractions like waiting in line and micro checking random stuff. How
to avoid it?

Roosevelt dashes: Deep work sessions: schedule in time blocks that are
completely distraction free: no email, social media etc.

Suggests not using social media at all. I like the idea but want to still read
articles from there. Probably get a twitter to rss thing?


Mindstorms by Seymour Papert
===
posted: February 2017
rating: yes

I enjoyed this short book by the inventor of LOGO, which I fondly remember first
hearing about from Yuri as a kid. It was a challenging read, especially in the
philosophical sections in the end. Also I have this weird thing where Seymour
Papert and Mark Gross somehow blend into one person??

Papert is fascinated by embodied learning, and the LOGO Turtle is one of many
examples of an "object to think with". This has great benefits for children,
since they can imagine becoming a turtle in their mind. For example, drawing a
circle as a Turtle is simple: take a small step forward, turn to the right a
bit, rinse and repeat. This is easily translated into LOGO: `FORWARD 1; RIGHT
1;`.

Papert rails against the way math is presented in school, making compelling
arguments in its direction as well as the direction of "New Math", which I guess
was a big deal in 1980 but has not aged well. He draws a comparison from our
current educational system to QWERTY, which we have kept for a long time despite
its obsolescence. He warns about a dumb use of computers in the classroom, in
which computers program the child (e.g. Mavis beacon teaches typing). In
Papert's world, the child programs the computer and learns in the process.

Conceptually, LOGO represents a third view of geometry. Three views of geometry:
Euclidean is the most abstract, providing conceptual underpinnings. Cartesian,
which allows for algebraic descriptions and practical applications. And Turtle
which allows for an algorithmic approach. Latter is also more intuitively
approachable.

Today Papert's ideas live on in the maker movement, which Papert is generally
considered to have fathered (at least conceptually). I care about this movement
a lot. Also in my work as a software prototyper, I gravitate to "learning
through making", which is the lens through which I view my job.

Throughout the book Papert makes amazing analogies I haven't heard of before:

- Analogy of artificial intelligence to artificial flight. We started by
  imitating birds with flapping machines, but that clearly failed. Instead we
  had to understand the principles (aerodynamics, bernoulli).

- Analogy of samba school to education in general. Samba school is a naturally
  integrated part of life in Brazil. It's informal, highly intense, sought
  after. Great model for modern edu?

- Analogy of teaching someone to juggle to programming computers. I haven't
  really thought about this, but maybe this is why so many CS people juggle?

- Analogy of the skiing revolution of the 70s to what is happening in computers.
  One of many changes in skiing style that came about alongside a revolution in
  ski technology. Did the new skiing technology cause the new style or vice
  versa? Papert suggests a deep entanglement between the two.

"The most powerful idea is that there are powerful ideas."

Don't Think of an Elephant by George Lakoff
===
posted: February 2017
rating: no

He's way too simple in his breakdown. The two family views is ridiculous. It's
not fucking binary. People have much more granular and specific world views.
Cambridge analytics showed that very well with both Brexit and Trump.  Very
dated. Lots of 2000s era references that are no longer relevant, like
Schwarzenegger. Also a very political message, never giving conservatives a
steel man.

I forgot the book on a plane. But I won't be attempting it again despite its
short length.


The Futurological Congress by Stanislav Lem
===
posted: January 2017
rating: yes

I'm a huge fan of Lem's work. I'm especially fond of Cyberiad, Star Diaries and
Solaris, but it has probably been over a decade since I've read one of his
books.

I wanted to get back into Lem, so I asked Marcin for recommendations, and he
suggested this one. My interest was piqued since I'm vaguely into rational
predictions, but as I read through, I was intrigued and surprised.

In the near future, the world has become politically unstable. A group of
futurologists meet at a summit in Costa Rica, and find themselves in the middle
of a military coup. To combat unrest, the government has begun experimenting
with air- and water-borne mind altering chemicals called Love Thy Neighbor
(LTN). As a result, most of the attendees of the congress suffer from
hallucinations and increased lovey-doveyness.  Lem's vivid descriptions of the
insanity inside the congress hotel are very entertaining.

In an attempt to remain rational and escape the vile chemistry, the main hero,
Lem's recurring character Ijon Tichy and a ragtag group of futurologists and
hotel workers end up in the basement below the hotel. For a while, Tichy fends
off the hallucinogens, but ultimately succumbs to them. The remainder of
the book (its majority) takes place in Ijon's disturbed imagination. This is
revealed only in retrospect, as Ijon wakes from each dream, finding himself in
the basement sewer, back in Costa Rica. Each of Tichy's hallucinations is a
different vision of a possible dystopian future, full of hilarity.

In his last and most convincing hallucination, Tichy is cryogenically frozen
only to be reanimated three decades later in a society that has completely
mastered mind-altering chemistry. Lem (and the translator, who did a fine job)
play incessantly with words, inventing at least fourty, all derived from
the idea of psychem, drugs that regulate every moment. The world is utopian,
but something isn't quite right. Tichy meets up with his (also reanimated)
futurologist friend, who gives him a whiff of "up'n'at'm, one of the
vigilanimides that can temporarily cancel out the effects of other psychem.
Tichy finally sees the world for what it is: a disturbing hellscape populated by
cyborg zombies.

Nowhere in the book is it clear whether you are in Tichy's hallucionation or in
actual reality. Clearly the book predates many of the many modern Sci Fi staples
that toy with the notion of reality, like the Matrix. Overall, it reads super
quickly and is incredibly engaging. Despite its humor, this book is quite deep.
It explores a lot of the same issues that concern me with VR. Chemistry is just
another of virtualizing reality.



On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi by William Tenn

posted: January 2017
rating: yes

An entertaining short story in the newly formed genre of Jewish Science Fiction.
Very memorable characters: the conservative father, his liberal son.

The author (previously unknown to me) does a great job of capturing the essence
of Jewishness. The dialog is great, and the content is meaty. The theme of
constant repression regardless of circumstances comes up again and again.

The core issue is whether or not an alien race can be considered Jewish.
Hopefully this is an issue we can grapple with one day.

Loved the punch line:

> I don’t know. Let’s talk about something cheerful. How many people would you
say were killed in that earthquake on Callisto?


Superforecasters by Phil Tetlock

Good vs bad experts is apparently thing. I wondered: was there enough data to
really know? What if everyone is a bad forecaster in aggregate? Luckily Tetlock
addresses it later.

How to superforecast:

- Consider the outside view (eg. base rates)
- Consider many perspectives on the same issue (eg. on one hand, on the other hand, on the third hand, on the nth hand).
- Fermi problem style breakdown
- Might benefit from explicit uncertainty tracking software. It's apparently [a
genre][uncertain-sw].
- I'm most interested in [guesstimate][]
- Include opinions of others. They are valuable data.

Also interesting is the personality trait of being open to new experiences. And
curiosity in general.

Active open mindedness. Seek out dissenting opinions.

Debaters is an instance of active open mindedness too - AOM

"Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded"

Interesting idea: adversarial collaboration. For example, Kahneman & Klein, usually at odds with one another, still managed to publish an influential paper: http://www.fiddlemath.net/stuff/conditions-for-intuitive-expertise.pdf

Kahneman sneaking in: suggesting that supreforecasters are better at "internalizing" system 2 thinking via system 1.

Tetlock closes with a summary of the book in the form of ten commandments:

1. Triage. Focus on questions where extra attention is likely to improve accuracy. Not too hard, not too easy. Weigh the consequences of wasting time on an unpredictable event vs failing to predict a predictable event before deciding whether to invest effort on a problem.
2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems ie use Fermi estimates.
3. Strike the right balance between the inside and outside views.
4. Strike the right balance between under- and over-reacting to new evidence.
5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. Weigh all the perspectives.
6. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits, but no more ie get comfortable using fine-grained estimates for fine-grained problems.
7. Strike the right balance between under- and over-confidence, between prudence and decisiveness.
8. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases. Own your failures!
9. Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you. Team dynamics matter as much as team composition.
10. Master the error-balancing bicycle. These commandments are not enough - you need deep, deliberative practice.
11. Don’t treat commandments as commandments.

Overall a great book, but I'm left feeling a bit unsatisfied. Another random
thought: everything I've read this year is basically like "foxes >> hedgehogs".
But surely there must be some good arguments in defense of hedgehogs.
