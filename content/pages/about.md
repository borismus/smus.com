Hello from the west coast!

My goal is to invent, design, and build delightful human interfaces at the edge
of technological possibility. I prefer working on small, interdisciplinary
teams, iterating quickly, releasing often, and working in the open. I gravitate
to the web platform, but am also well versed in mobile development,
audio-related technology, and lightweight hardware prototyping. My ideal role
involves a mix of software engineering, UX design, and invention.

I have experience building speech interfaces, virtual reality, audio processing,
the web platform, developer tools, rapid prototyping, interactive visualization,
and user interface design. I've written popular technical articles and gave
talks to thousands of developers. I have
[published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bIgFmUwAAAAJ&hl=en) many
patents and a few academic papers. I support and regularly contribute to [open
source projects](https://github.com/borismus/). My [portfolio](/portfolio)
shows off some of my recent work.

I have a Masters in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University,
and a BSc (hon) in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of
British Columbia. I was born in Leningrad, RSFSR, and spent my formative years
in Vancouver, Canada.
