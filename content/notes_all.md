I posted an [Article Highlights of
2019](/notes/2019/article-highlights-of-2019/), and vowed to read fewer articles
this year. I don't think that I've succeeded.

# Medicine
- It was thought to be caused by noxious air — “malaria”, for example, literally means “bad air". [Age of Invention: A Breath of Fresh Air](https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-a-breath-of-fresh)
- The typical development time for a vaccine against a new disease is over five years. We've done really well this time around. [The first modern pandemic](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Pandemic-Innovation)
- We must immediately begin random sampling of the population using both PCR testing that tells up about active infections and antibody tests that informs about who has been infected in the past. [Flying Blind on Coronavirus: Why Random Testing is so Important](https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2020/04/flying-blind-on-coronavirus-why-random.html)
- Rick bought his own qPCR machine and thinks that this is the future of biotech. He may well be right! [The dawn of personal biotech](https://medium.com/@RickByers/the-dawn-of-personal-biotech-cb0af0d52e4c)
- Countries have two options: either they fight it hard now or they will suffer a massive epidemic. (May 28) [Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance](https://tomaspueyo.medium.com/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56)
- Many health experts, including the surgeon general of the United States, told the public simultaneously that masks weren’t necessary for protecting the general public and that health care workers needed the dwindling supply. [Why Telling People They Don’t Need Masks Backfired](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html)
- You can apparently saturate an entire city with Tamiflu if the entire city had the bird flu. [How society can overcome covid-19](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2020/04/04/how-society-can-overcome-covid-19)
- The plague resurfaced roughly every 20 years from 1348 to 1665. 40 outbreaks in 300 years! And many more crazy pandemic stories. [How 5 of History's Worst Pandemics Finally Ended](https://www.history.com/news/pandemics-end-plague-cholera-black-death-smallpox)
- But the warnings of thoughtful shutdown skeptics warrant careful study, not stigma rooted in the false pretense that they don’t have any plausible concerns or value human life. [Take the Shutdown Skeptics Seriously](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/take-shutdown-skeptics-seriously/611419/)
- The obliteration of all microbes as often and aggressively as possible is not always appropriate. As with any medicine, more does not mean better. Not enough time to shower? Washing underarms, groin, and feet may actually be healthier. [You’re Showering Too Much](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/hygiene-is-overrated/612235/)



# Self help

- When a difficulty comes your way, you should feel proud and excited, like “a wrestler whom God, like a trainer, has paired with a tough young buck.” [How to Be a Stoic](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/how-to-be-a-stoic)
- Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it. [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)
- Rationality used to be this capacious concept that included reasonableness, but no longer. [Is rationality overrated?](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/20/21068423/rationality-behavioral-economics-psychology-reasonable-decisions)
- It now feels okay to have an ordinary life, to not make big contributions, to be an ordinary person. I never felt like that before. [Narcissism](https://edelwax.medium.com/narcissism-4c314beb39eb)
- Leonardo da Vinci wrote: …the more minutely you describe, the more you will confuse the mind of the reader and the more you will remove him from knowledge of the thing described.

- They offer conceptual scaffolding for answering what I consider to be the most important question of our time: _How can we be good ancestors?_.

# Education
- An elite private school in Sydney, Australia, the alma mater of three prime ministers, banned laptops in 2016 and required students to handwrite essays through the tenth grade: the headmaster said the school found money spent on interactive white boards, laptops, and the associated software was a total waste. [Rotten STEM: How Technology Corrupts Education](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/)
- [Installing Air Filters in Classrooms Has Surprisingly Large Educational Benefits](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21051869/indoor-air-pollution-student-achievement)
- The best methods are therefore those that supply comprehensible input in low anxiety situations, containing messages that students really want to hear. These methods do not force early production in the second language. [Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html)



# Sustainability
- Fire professionals should be considering ecology and picking their fights: letting fires that pose little risk burn through the stockpiles of fuels. Yet that’s not the mission.

- Tree planting can often worsen outcomes for everything from the number of bird, insect, and plant species to measures of canopy cover, tree density, and forest structure. Still haven't learned from SLAS? Nature knows best.

- For Warren, the problem with modern American capitalism is that it is not nearly capitalist enough. It has been captured by special interests, which are strangling competition.

- Unfortunately, the problem of nuclear arms is still very serious today. [Turning point at Chernobyl by Gorbachev](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2006/04/21/commentary/world-commentary/turning-point-at-chernobyl/)

- Trump improved over his 2016 performance among Black women (+4 percentage points), Black men (+5), Latinas (+3) and Latinos (+4).” A third of Latino men, and a quarter of Latino women, picked Trump.

Books highlights of 2019
===
posted: Dec 31, 2019

I’ve been reading and summarizing for five years now (cue Ratatat). I’m not sure that it’s helped much with retention, but at the very least, having an easily searchable corpus of my book-related notes is worthwhile.

A decent year for fiction, I finally read [Invisible Cities](/books/invisible-cities-by-italo-calvino/), which I enjoyed not viscerally, but more as an art piece. I liked [The Fiddler is a Good Woman](/books/the-fiddler-is-a-good-woman/) for the author’s ability to retell the same sordid tale from multiple perspectives. [Diamond Age](http://localhost:5500/books/diamond-age-by-stephenson-audio/) was a collection of incredible ideas and surprisingly relevant for my job. I also enjoyed [Hyperion](/books/hyperion-by-dan-simmons-audio/), especially Sol Weintraub’s tale, which touched me deeply. [The Fifth Season](/books/the-fifth-season-by-n-k-jemisin/) was interesting, but I have some identitarian reservations. I think my overall fiction highlight was [Homer’s Odyssey translated by Emily Wilson](/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio/).

I read two non-fiction books which were a little too extreme for my tastes: [Deschooling Society](/books/deschooling-society-by-ivan-illich), which just read like an angry and ill considered screed and [Radical Markets](/books/radical-markets-by-posner-and-weyl/), which had some really interesting ideas, but presented as a whole seemed ridiculous. I really enjoyed [Timefulness](/books/timefulness-by-marcia-bjornerud-audio/), a whirlwind overview of geology, and [Range](/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/), an ode to generalists. The standout non-fiction for me was [Seeing Like a State](/books/seeing-like-a-state-by-james-scott/), which will continue to turn over in my mind for years to come. I listened to fewer history lectures than usual, but can wholeheartedly recommend [The Story of Medieval England](/books/the-story-of-medieval-england-audio/). Instead, I focused on parenting books, which are pretty bad as a genre. That said, [The New Father](/books/the-new-father/) served as a worthwhile companion to skim during the first year of Eliana’s life, and [Yes Brain](/books/yes-brain-by-siegel-and-bryson/) had practical suggestions for digesting mindfulness into something that small children might be able to understand.

I also begun a new long-term book summarization project, which is to digest [Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery](), and visualize it as a Civ-style tech tree. Hopefully I’ll have something to report on that front in 2020!
