Invention & Discovery Cards work complete
===
posted: Jan 24, 2025

I'm pleased to have completed transforming [Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery](/books/asimovs-chronology-of-science-and-discovery/) into a deck of Magic Cards. Over five years later, all 1477 entries from
Asimov's encyclopedia are now represented as illustrated cards on <https://invention.cards>. The
website is rendered based on [this master spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hDNXas7DzwglB95HV2_2u1utWAwBZR2hQHlMPz-fj5A/edit?gid=0#gid=0) which I compiled with the help of AI
and manually vetted. Since AI hallucinations can safely be ignored, and I am infallible, I declare victory!

# Just kidding...

A project like this is never over, but I did make some revisions to <https://invention.cards> to celebrate
the data milestone.

- The site now has a title.
- The list of all cards is now fully scrollable.
- Rendering is capped to 100 cards to maintain performance.
- No limit to the depth of the ancestor or successor trees.
- Added random card button.

In 2019, when I [first cracked Asimov's encyclopedia](/books/asimovs-chronology-of-science-and-discovery/), I immediately wanted to turn it into a visual chronology:

> My goal is to ultimately generate a visual, Civilization-style technology tree for this whole book.

Mission accomplished, amirite? Permit me a quick walk down memory lane:

- 2020: My [initial visualization](/visual-chronology-science-discovery) was inspired by the then newly coined [Progress Studies](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/).
- 2021 brought headwinds which stymied my progress studies. We now had two young children to raise and a pandemic to survive.
- 2022 brought tailwinds in the form of hawt new AI models. By early 2024 I posted an [illustrated revision](/visual-chronology-science-discovery-v2/) and extended the chronology to the year 1850. Data-wise, this was just the half-way point.
- 2024: I [used AI to accelerate the process](/invention-cards-ai/) and by the end of the year, I'd advanced up to 1945.
- 2025 brings us to today!

# That's funny...

> The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not "Eureka!" but "That's funny..." - Isaac Asimov

Throughout the process of reading and summarizing, I kept an "Asimov surprise log", capturing the head scratchers that made me pause and say "That's funny...":

1. Specific surprising inventions and discoveries (e.g. Why is it that [Dendrochronology](https://invention.cards/dendrochronology) was only conceived of in 1920?)
2. Multiple inventions and discoveries (e.g. How is it that we made space-related discoveries before inventing [telescopes](https://invention.cards/telescope)?)
3. Groups of cards that tell a compelling story (e.g. Why did it take fifteen centuries to invent the practical steam engine after the [Greeks harnessed steam for motion](https://invention.cards/basic-steam-engine)?)
4. Broad patterns across inventions and discoveries (e.g. Which general purpose inventions unlocked the most compelling discoveries?)
5. Meta-observations about what the source material (e.g. Asimov's background in Chemistry and golden age sci-fi explains disproportional energy spend on biology, chemistry, and astronomy. In 2025, what are our collective blinders?)

Now that this project is in some sense complete, I hope to spend some energy elaborating on these and other
questions in the near future. Stay tuned!


Unintended Consequences of False Equity
===
posted: Oct 28, 2024

What if our pursuit of educational equity is perpetuating inequality? Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, true educational equity must lift all students, regardless of background or ability.

In a school setting, equity refers not to the equality of outcomes, but to the equality of opportunities for all students to succeed. In recent years, Seattle Public Schools (SPS) has prioritized supporting students furthest from educational justice (FFEJ), a laudable goal that aims to address historical inequities. However, this narrow focus has unintended consequences. While healthy adults may not need medicine, children — even the brightest — require external stimulation to reach their full academic potential. Here are three negative secondary effects of an overemphasis on FFEJ students.

<!--more-->

First is **reduced enrollment and funding to the district**. As high-end academics stagnate, displeased parents of capable children pull their children out of public school. This exodus is prominently displayed in Seattle, where a quarter of school-age children have now withdrawn from public school (up from one-sixth in 2022). Since Washington schools are funded per capita, less enrollment means less money funneling into the school district. From this purely self-interested financial perspective, neglecting capable students is like sawing off the branch you are sitting on.
Furthermore, prioritizing FFEJ students also leads to **less equity for highly capable students from poorer families**. Private school is not cheap, and homeschooling is a luxury that only some families can afford, with at least one parent no longer able to work full-time. Thus, many families dissatisfied with public academics will not have the luxury of leaving the system. With the richest opting out of the public system, there are also less donations flowing to the Parent Teacher Student Associations (PTSA). With fewer capable students in the system and fewer exemplars of excellence for other students to follow, we will see a stronger correlation between socioeconomic status and academics. As a result, highly capable students forced to remain in the public system have reduced upward mobility.

A related side effect of this policy is an **academic inversion in affluent neighborhoods**, whose public schools become worse than those in poorer neighborhoods. When an upper-class neighborhood predominantly enrolls its children in private schools, the public school in the area will stagnate and cater to a smaller audience on the outer rim of the catchment area. In Seattle, this effect is on display in Laurelhurst.

Quoting [Charlotte Howard](https://mediadirectory.economist.com/people/charlotte-howard/), The Economist’s executive editor:

> There’s a real opportunity for leaders to talk not about coddling specific subgroups, but passing broad policies to help Americans writ large, regardless of their particular group to advance.

What needs to happen is pretty simple: give each student what they need to thrive; actual equity. In SPS, this would mean bringing back programs for highly capable students. This does not need to be done in a separate school as in the recently terminated Highly Capable Cohort (HCC) program. But it should probably not be done in the same classrooms as the other students, with no additional resources for already overloaded teachers. Enriched and remedial classes within neighborhood schools are a tested and true solution to this problem. These new programs need measurable goals so that the district can begin [to be accountable](/notes/2024/seattle-public-schools-accountability-problem/) in their pursuits of high-end excellence.

In conclusion, our current educational system's emphasis on minimal standards directly impacts highly capable students and ultimately has an indirect negative impact on all students. It's time for Seattle and other progressive school districts to reclaim "equity", unlock the full potential of our children, and empower them to shape a brighter future for humanity.


Seattle Public Schools accountability problem
===
posted: Oct 12, 2024

Imagine if Microsoft's company guidance was that it would make $100 billion this quarter. The end of the quarter rolls along and as it turns out, they only made $10 billion. This surprising result would lead to a market selloff frenzy. Microsoft's stock would take such a beating that surely their board would demand their CEO's resignation for gross mismanagement.

In contrast, Seattle Public Schools (SPS) has missed their targets comparably. The school district has not been held accountable by the school board. In 2019, SPS declared their first [top-line goal](https://www.seattleschools.org/about/school-board/student-outcomes-focused-governance/) was as follows:

> The percentage of Black boys who achieve English Language Arts proficiency or higher on the 3rd grade Smarter Balanced Assessment will increase from 28% in June 2019, to 70% in June 2024.

June 2024 has come and gone, and this metric has moved from 28% to 32%. This is a mere 4% difference; a far cry from the 40% required to meet their self-determined goal. For this objectively terrible performance, the school board gave Mr. Jones a raise and lauded him for being “a strong leader for racial equity and educational justice.”

The situation is even worse than this comparison to big tech reveals. When Microsoft misses its goals, the victims are also the most capable of having righted the ship. Also, the damage is limited: the CEO and former employees will find new jobs, and shareholders will make better investments next time. In the case of a school district, the victims are innocent children who had no hand in the matter, and the impact on their life is profound. In short, our children's education is being undermined by shortsighted, unaccountable adults.

It's time for the school board to do their job and hold school district executives accountable for failing to meet expectations. It's time to set better, more realistic goals, and it's time to achieve them.

Nine Links for Fall 2023

posted: Jan 8, 2024

Here is a small selection of intriguing articles I read online over the last three months.

- [Political Analysis Needs More Witchcraft](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/10/magic-sorcery-politics/675836/) (*The Atlantic*) — Beliefs, true or false, rational or irrational, shape politics, and many people self-report a belief in witchcraft (1/6 in US, 2/3 of Latvia), and 85% globally believe in God. Academics and pundits tend to dismiss these views for being outlandish and this is a major blind spot.
- [Metrics, Cowardice, and Mistrust](https://nothinghuman.substack.com/p/metrics-cowardice-and-mistrust) (*Ivan Vendrov*) — Vendrov describes a feedback loop in which making the wrong call based on intuition, or delegating to someone who does the same can be a firing offense at a corporate job. The result of this cover-your-ass mentality is an over-reliance on metrics at the expense of velocity and good outcomes.
- [A Whole New Cope](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/a-whole-new-cope) (*Venkatesh Rao*) — Most of us have negligible power to do anything about concerning events half way across the world, yet are deeply affected by them. Rao suggests this is because we interpret these events not in isolation but as signs and portents of our entire world beginning to come apart.
- [‘Ketman’ and Doublethink: What It Costs to Comply With Tyranny](https://aeon.co/ideas/ketman-and-doublethink-what-it-costs-to-comply-with-tyranny) (*Jacob Mikanowski*) — Contra Arendt, who believed that the subjects produced by totalitarianism no longer distinguish between fact and fiction, Miłosz argued that they practiced what he called Ketman, first mastering deception, then practicing it competitively, valuing cunning over all else, and finally losing the ability to "differentiate his true self from the self he simulates".
- [Employees Risk More](https://medium.com/@ben_mathes/employees-risk-more-8b757f6bbf0a) (*Ben Mathes*) — VCs invest money into a portfolio of bets, while the startup employee invests all of their time into one risky bet. Investors can raise more money, but employees can't raise more time, so if you're looking to join a startup, do your homework!
- [The Wolf](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-wolf/) (*Rands*) — Describes an engineer archetype who works outside well-defined processes and is unburdened by the "encumbering necessities of a group of people building at scale". As a result, he is incredibly effective and appears to suffer no consequences for not following the rules.
- [Old Wards and New Against Fake Humans](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/09/22/wards) (*Interconnected*) — Practical advice for detecting a fake human on the internet: challenge him to say something obscene. On a video call? Have your interlocutor turn sideways and show you her ears, and watch for visual glitches. It's "like shaking hands from the old days, demonstrating that I’m not about to draw my sword."
- [Becoming a magician](https://autotranslucence.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/) (*Autotranslucence*) — Have you reached a plateau? Is your well-worn strategy bringing you diminishing returns? Pause and consider who you want to be next. What are the fears that hold you back? Who are you really impressed by? Surround yourself with those people that look like magicians to you, learn from them, articulate your new goal and find a new strategy to get there.
- [A Tool to Supercharge Your Imagination](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/10/ai-image-generation-human-creativity-imagination/675840/) (*Ian Bogost*) — In an uncharacteristically optimistic article, Bogost lauds modern image generation models for their ability to quickly "shape unfiltered thoughts" and give them "shape outside your mind", but ignores the downsides. It's a bit like reading a book and then watching the movie: all of the fuzzy but vivid mental imagery in your mind's eye collapses into the images on the screen. Gandalf will never again be an abstract wizard, only the one depicted by Ian McKellen.

Happy New Year to you all!
