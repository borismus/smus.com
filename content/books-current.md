cover: /assets/book-covers/valis.jpg

VALIS stands for _Vast Active Living Intelligence System_, a critical piece in Horselover Fat's vision of God. This revelation comes at a turbulent time in Fat's life, shortly after his wife's suicide and the subsequent suicide of multiple girlfriends in the Bay Area of the 1960s.

> No one could discern how much was due to drugs. This time in America—1960 to 1970—and this place, the Bay Area of Northern California, was totally fucked.

This is not a plot driven book, but just as a reminder to myself, here it is.

Fat, completely obsessed with his religious experience, sets out to document it in his Exegesis and shares it with a small group of friends, including Philip K. Dick, who turns out to be Fat himself — in a schizophrenic way. Another of Fat's friends Kevin introduces Fat to a film called Valis which contains obvious references to events and prophecies identical to those that in Horselover Fat's revelations. This is intriguing to Fat/Phil, Kevin and their other friend David, and they all seek out the films makers. One of them turns out to be Eric Lampton, who appears to be some superposition of David Bowie and Eric Clapton. Through Eric and his wife, the friends, now calling themselves the Rhipidon Society ("fish cannot carry guns"), meet their daughter. She is a two-year-old girl named Sophia who is the incarnation of the Messiah, as prophesized. She cures Phil's schizophrenic personality split, confirms VALIS' existence and preaches that we should worship humanity, not gods. She dies days later in an unfortunate accident, which Phil forsees in a dream. This shock which eventually brings Fat back into existence and sends him on a global quest to find the next Messiah.

This was not an easy book to get through but I found it theologically intriguing.

# Deep references everywhere
VALIS features a wild mishmash of cultural references, from highbrow to lowbrow and back. I was familiar with most, but post-VALIS they will be tinged with a psychotic valence when I revisit them. Time to listen.

- "Tis this that racks my brain, And pours into my breast a thousand pangs, That lash me into madness..." from an aria in **Handel's Messiah**. "Fat and I used to listen to my Seraphim LP of Richard Lewis singing it"
- **“Total Eclipse” from Handel’s “Samson”**
- “My favorite Dead album is **Workingman’s Dead**,” Gloria said at one point.
- "Remind him of the night he and Bob had seen **the movie Patton** before attending Gloria’s graveside service"
- Fat could not write poetry worth shit, despite his best efforts. He loved **Wordsworth’s “Ode,”** and wished he could come up with its equal. He never did
- “You see, son, here time becomes space.” **Wagner, Parsifal**, Act 1 (1882).  (Surprisingly, Parsifal seems to have been [banned in Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal#Racism_debate))
- (VALIS was also turned into an Opera by MIT Media Lab's Tod Machover, [re-produced in 2023](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/valis-an-opera-by-tod-machover/))

I loved PKD's linguistic play, for example:

- Take this English instance: GOD IS NO WHERE / GOD IS NOW HERE, which is pretty relevant because of the all-caps, no-spaces style of [[Carolingian minuscule]] in the [[High Middle Ages]].
- The main protagonist is Horselover Fat, a schizophrenic persona of PKD. Philip in Greek means "fond of horses"; dick is German for "fat".


# On Parsifal and confusion
Dick writes:

> Parsifal is one of those corkscrew artifacts of culture in which you get the subjective sense that you’ve learned something from it, something valuable or even priceless; but on closer inspection you suddenly begin to scratch your head and say, “Wait a minute. This makes no sense.” I can see Richard Wagner standing at the gates of heaven. “You have to let me in,” he says. “I wrote Parsifal. It has to do with the Grail, Christ, suffering, pity and healing. Right?” And they answer, “Well, we read it and it makes no sense.” SLAM. Wagner is right and so are they.

VALIS belongs in the same bucket of "corkscrew artifacts of culture". I can see Philip K. Dick standing at the same gates.

# Maurice and Fat's parallel versions of religion
Fat's therapist is Maurice, a former IDF paratrooper with bulging muscles. He is hilariously depicted in a series of theological dialogs exhibiting their two very different takes on God. Maurice's straightforward and pragmatic, PKD's esoteric and hand-ringingly intellectual:

> Staring at him, Maurice said, “Who made up this stuff? You?”
>
> “Basically,” Fat said, “my doctrine is Valentinian, second century C.E.”
>
> “What’s ‘C.E.’?” “Common Era. The designation replaces A.D. Valentinus’s Gnosticism is the more subtle branch as opposed to the Iranian, which of course was strongly influenced by Zoroastrianism dualism. Valentinus perceived the ontological salvific value of the gnosis, since it reversed the original, primal condition of ignorance, which represents the state of the fall, the impairment of the Godhead which resulted in the botched creation of the phenomenal or material world.

Maurice reminds Fat of the scriptures, but Fat brings in his own Gnostic takes. It's pretty funny.

> Let me tell you what it says in _Genesis_, in case you've forgotten. Then God said, Let us make man in our image and likeness to rule the fish in the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all--”
>
> “Okay,” Fat breaks in, “but that's the creator deity, not the true God.”
>
>“What?” Maurice says.
>
> Fat says, “That's Yaldaboath. Sometimes called Samael, the blind God. He's deranged.”
>
> “What the hell are you talking about?” Maurice said.
>
> “Yaldaboath is a monster spawned by Sophia who fell from the Pleroma...”

And my favorite exchange:

> “Let me just say one thing,” Fat said.
>
> Irritably, Maurice nodded.
>
> “The creator deity,” Fat said, “may be insane and therefore the universe is insane. What we experience as chaos is actually irrationality. There is a difference.”
>
> He was silent, then. “The universe is what you make of it,” Maurice said. “It’s what you do with it that counts. It’s your responsibility to do something life-promoting with it, not life-destructive.”
>
> “That’s the existential position,” Fat said. “Based on the concept that We are what we do, rather than, We are what we think. It finds its first expression in Goethe’s Faust, Part One, where Faust says, ‘Im Anfang war das Wort.’ He’s quoting the opening of the Fourth Gospel; ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ Faust says, ‘Nein, Im Anfang war die Tat.’ ‘In the beginning was the deed.’ From this, all existentialism comes.” Maurice stared at him as if he were a bug.

# The Exegesis
PKD began a journal capturing his visionary experiences in 1974, which I would guess served as the basis for many of his works, certainly including VALIS. Interestingly, twenty years after publishing VALIS, fragments of this journal were compiled into [his Exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exegesis_of_Philip_K._Dick). This book may have helped PKD get some of these ideas into the world in a less serious way.

Horselover Fat (aka PKD) experienced divine revelation. Sites of his brain were being selectively stimulated by tight energy beams emanating from far off, perhaps millions of miles away. He was in fact seeing and hearing words, pictures, figures of people, printed pages, in short God and God’s Message, or, as Fat liked to call it, the Logos.

Much of the references found in the Exegesis is well beyond my ken, referencing Gnostic ideas and works such as [On the Origin of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_the_World), featuring obscure personae like the fallen archangel Samael, and Pistis Sophia, a figure representing "Wisdom in Faith":

> He said, ‘I am god and no other one exists except me.’ But when he said these things, he sinned against all of the immortal (imperishable) ones, and they protected him. Moreover, when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler, she was angry. Without being seen, she said, ‘You err, Samael,’ i.e., ‘the blind god.’ ‘An enlightened, immortal man exists before you. This will appear within your molded bodies. He will trample upon you like potter’s clay, (which) is trampled. And you will go with those who are yours down to your mother, the abyss.’

Horselover Fat's Gnostic speculations remind me of [John Dee and the Empire of Angels](/books/john-dee-and-the-empire-of-angels-by-jason-louv/), and his exegesis closely mirrors Dee's and Kelly's scrying sessions.

# An Irrational God?
Since the universe appears to be irrational, and created in God's image, it must be the case that God is irrational:

> Fat believed that a streak of the irrational permeated the entire universe, all the way up to God or the Ultimate Mind, which lay behind it. [...] In other words, the universe itself—and the Mind behind it—is insane. Therefore, someone in touch with reality is, by definition, in touch with the insane: infused by the irrational.

When Fat is admitted into a mental asylum, Dr. Stone sees him and understands him and appears versed in the same Gnostic tradition. He guides Fat to seek a higher god, above the veneer of irrationality:

> The answer to Fat’s question, “Is the universe irrational, and is it irrational because an irrational mind governs it?” receives this answer, via Dr. Stone: “Yes it is, the universe is irrational; the mind governing it is irrational; but above them lies another God, the true God, and he is not irrational; in addition that true God has outwitted the powers of this world, ventured here to help us, and we know him as the Logos,”

> "The mentally disturbed do not employ the Principle of Scientific Parsimony: the most simple theory to explain a given set of facts. They shoot for the baroque." — PKD, VALIS

# Time and remembering the past and future
PKD continuously explores the subject of the fungibility of time, and whether you can "remember future lives":

> Siddhartha, the Buddha, remembered all his past lives; this is why he was given the title of buddha which means “the Enlightened One.” [...] Empedocles, too, like the Buddha and Pythagoras, could remember his past lives. What they did not talk about was their ability to “remember” future lives.

Can you have a collective memory?

> Phylogenic memory, memory of the species. Not my own memory, ontogenic memory. “Phylogeny is recapitulated in ontogeny,” as it is put. The individual contains the history of his entire race, back to its origins. Back to ancient Rome, to Minos at Crete, back to the stars.

PKD elaborates on the concept of the abolition of time, described as a "loss of amnesia" with ample references and impressive erudition:

> The great mystery of Eleusis, of the Orphies, of the early Christians, of Sarapis, of the Greco-Roman mystery religions, of Hermes Trismegistos, of the Renaissance Hermetic alchemists, of the Rose Cross Brotherhood, of Apollonius of Tyana, of Simon Magus, of Asklepios, of Paracelsus, of Bruno, consists of the abolition of time. The techniques are there. Dante discusses them in the Comedy. It has to do with the loss of amnesia; when forgetfulness is lost, true memory spreads out backward and forward, into the past and into the future, and also, oddly, into alternate universes; it is orthogonal as well as linear.

All of this time business reminds me of the idea of a sacred time in [[The Sabbath by Heschel]].

# Multiple entities fill the same niche over time

[Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth](/books/mystery-teachings-by-j-m-greer/) introduced me to this idea of filling a placeholder, where the organism may die, but another will take its place:

> **Placeholders in ecosystems**: I found powerful the idea that individuals in an ecosystem can be seen as fitting into a placeholder. The organism may die, but its immediate life wasn't that important for the whole system. The individual was playing a role that many had played in the past, and many will play in the future.

Greer provides examples of this niche that is filled by a sequence of organisms. This is echoed by PKD in a little vignette of a playing cat:

> Somewhere, Schopenhauer says that the cat which you see playing in the yard is the cat which played three hundred years ago.

PKD speculates wildly that the same soul is transferring through multiple bodies.

> We are talking about Christ. He is an extra-terrestrial life form which came to this planet thousands of years ago, and, as living information, passed into the brains of human beings already living here, the native population. We are talking about interspecies symbiosis. Before being Christ he was Elijah. The Jews know all about Elijah and his immortality—and his ability to extend immortality to others by “dividing up his spirit.” The Qumran people knew this. They sought to receive part of Elijah’s spirit. “You see, my son, here time changes into space.”

This can also apply to empires. Dick's refrain "the empire never ended" is a core part of PKD's gnostic worldview and points to the notion that the oppressive power structures of ancient Rome—or “the Empire”—persist throughout time, concealed behind ever-shifting forms of government, technology, and society:

> ...During the interval in which he had experienced the two-world superimposition, he had seen not only California, USA, of the year 1974 but also ancient Rome, he had discerned within the superimposition a Gestalt shared by both space-time continua, their common element: a Black Iron Prison. This is what the dream referred to as “the Empire.” He knew it because, upon seeing the Black Iron Prison, he had recognized it. Everyone dwelt in it without realizing it. The Black Iron Prison was their world.


The Maniac by Benjamín Labatut
===
rating: yes

I recently watched a movie called "The Bit Player" bankrolled by IEEE, about Claude Shannon and his contributions. The film was informative something was a bit off. In what could be described as a fauxcumentary or docudrama, Shannon was portrayed relatively convincingly by an actor, but rather than creating a narrative arc of his life and work, this fake Shannon was portrayed in a sequence of reenacted interviews. Some of them were informative and entertaining, others cringeworthy and irrelevant, almost bordering on mockumentary.

Upon reflection, I found "The Maniac" a little bit like "The Bit Player", which surprised me since like its [[When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut|predecessor]] it straddles this same fact-and-fiction line. Either under the influence of the Shannon documentary or because it is simply worse I enjoyed this book far less. Another contributing factor was perhaps that I listened to it as an audiobook and the narration, especially the female narrator who played Von Neumann's wife and daughter had a distracting accent, serving only to fortify the idea I just couldn't shake that these historical figures were just pantomiming actors.

---

**Parallels to the 1920s**: The anxious, tumultuous interwar vibe of the 1920s (“we knew that the wonderful world that was built for us was coming to an end”) reminded me of present-day feelings of precariousness. Both eras are shaped by major innovations (whether quantum theory or AI) combined with rapid political shifts to produce a collective sense of uneasy acceleration.

**Von Neumann’s Intellectual Legacy** touched many pivotal 20th-century developments: designing the first fully programmable computer (the “MANIAC”), formulating the principle of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), and conceiving of self-replicating machines well before the structure of DNA was even understood, as well as “von Neumann probes”, self-replicating spacecraft that could travel to the far reaches of the galaxy. This was simply interesting.

**His frenetic personal life** is a stark contrast with his boundless intellectual curiosity and comedic playfulness. The most disturbing were his late-in-life dabbling with religion: frenetic forays into his native Judaism, and a last-ditch conversion to Catholicism.

**Computing and the Hydrogen Bomb** the development of the hydrogen bomb required massive computational power. Human “calculators” could no longer handle the complexity; thus, machines like the MANIAC were indispensable. This foreshadows how computing became the central engine driving modern science and technology. [[Getting to many destinations requires tacking (zig-zagging)]]

**Creativity, Play, and AI** John von Neumann and Richard Feynman valued playfulness and curiosity in serious scientific inquiry. That said Labatut also did a good job of showing the perils of excessive playfulness: a certain nihilism and psychopathology. AI has taken a narrow path to mastery (AlphaZero’s pure self-play in Go), but still lacks the open-ended, playful immersion children show when learning. Can advanced AI develop a truly exploratory, flexible sense of “play” in the real world, rather than in highly constrained settings like Chess, Go? LLM advances for "play" in LLMs is very impressive, but the real world is more complex still. See [[Physical and embodied intelligence]].

**AI’s Impact on “Art”** is so far quite destructive. Lee Sedol lamented that Go used to be an art form but has changed now that AI dominates the game. A similar thing is happening with "Ghiblification", in which a beloved aesthetic that once took years of human effort can be conjured in seconds. This touches on a broader debate: Does AI’s involvement in creative or aesthetic fields reduce them to mechanical processes, or does it expand the boundaries of creativity?

**Extended Phenotype and Technology**: A spider’s web or a beaver’s dam are examples of the extended phenotype of their respective creators. Can we view technology as extended phenotype of the human? See [[Extended phenotype — technology as human secretion]].

**The Legends of Go** are really awesome. This was probably my favorite part of the book. Labatut evocatively describes the legendary Emperor Yao who invented the game of Go to challenge his wayward, evil son Danzhu. The victor would rule the universe. It seems like Labatut greatly embellishes the traditional tale, but it's worth it. Another memorable Go story retold in the second part of the book was that of the blood-vomiting game of 1835 which lasted four consecutive days after which the loser Akaboshi coughed or vomited blood all over the board, dying within a few months.


A Peace to End All Peace by David Fromkin
===
rating: yes
posted: Feb 24, 2025

Worth it for the name alone, this is a comprehensive presentation of what happened when the sick man of Europe finally died. It gives excellent background on the complexity of the Ottoman Empire's demographics, enmities between Turk and Arab, Sunni and Sunni-Wahhabi. It paints a vivid picture of the Three Pasha triumvirate, their unforgivable warcrimes, blunders and colorful deaths. It documents the victorious Allies scramble to divide up the spoils of war through shifting alliances, how they backstabbed each other, misunderstood the people they sought to govern, and mismanaged their own bureaucracies.

Great context for trying to understand what the fuck is happening in the Middle East today.

### The Ottoman Empire was heterogeneous and diverse, with few unifying aspects other than a shared faith in Islam

- **One-quarter of the Empire’s population was not Muslim**, meaning Christians (various sects) and Jews were common in many parts of the Empire.
- Only about **5% of subjects paid direct taxes to the central administration**, reflecting how real power resided in local strongmen, religious authorities, or tribal chieftains.
- The old Ottoman Empire contained Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and many others but the Empire was formally governed according to **Sharia (Islamic law)**
- There is **no separation between Church and State**. The Caliph is both the Pope and the President.
- Known as the "sick man of Europe", the **Ottoman Empire was slowly disintegrating**. Officially, it still held on to the notion that Egypt was part of it despite British having unofficial control since 1882. Similarly, Bulgaria was officially an Ottoman province but became functionally independent in 1885 after the Russo-Turkish War ended in Russian victory.

### The Muslim middle east was complex in ways the colonizing British and French misunderstood

- Many branches of Islam haven’t recognized a central Caliph for a millennium.
- **Turks against Arabs**: Ottoman leadership was Turkish, especially after the rise of the Young Turks / CUP, and Arabs in the Levant, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian Peninsula felt discriminated against.
- The **Arabs were not internally unified**. It was often observed that many Arab chieftains together would soon develop internal disagreements.
- The Ottoman state was **officially Sunni; however, large Shia** populations existed in places like Iraq and parts of eastern Anatolia.
- **Hashemites against Saudis** conflict pitted Hussein bin Ali (Hashemites) against Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud (Saudis). The Saudis were **Wahhabis**, practicing a more puritanical version of the **same Sunni faith**. Additionally they fought over control of the oasis cities of Kurma and Turaba.

### Russia played a major role in the Middle East during WW1

- For the British, the Ottoman empire was a convenient buffer zone that protected its interests from Russia.
- **As the Ottoman Empire weakened, Russia eyed Constantinople**, trying to push southward to gain direct access to warm-water ports and potentially secure a route to the Mediterranean. Largely in response to this threat, the British and French felt like they had to enter the fray and get a slice of the pie.
- Conversely, The Young Turks (particularly leaders in the Committee of Union and Progress, or **CUP) nursed a pan-Turkic dream that extended into Russian Central Asia**, including the territory of today’s Turkmenistan.
- Around the time of the Sykes-Picot agreement during WW1, the British and French promised Russia a share of Constantinople once the Ottomans were defeated.
- **Germany helped smuggle Lenin back to Russia (the “sealed train”),** hoping a Bolshevik takeover would knock Russia out of the war (see [[Defeatist vs Defensivist camps in early 20th century]]).
- This maneuver drastically affected the Middle East because the Bolsheviks, once in power, abandoned many Tsarist territorial ambitions, though they still harbored ideological goals.
- The new Soviet regime sought to reconquer or reassert influence over territories the Tsarist Empire had formerly taken, including parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Soviets took Anzali and the created a short-lived “**Persian Socialist Republic**” demonstrated Russia’s direct meddling south of the Caucasus.

### Greek and Turkish war was vicious and led to massive population shifts

- Fascinating histories of **Salonica** (historically very Jewish) which ended up the Greek Thessaloniki and **Smyrna** (historically Greek) which ended up the Turkish Izmir.
- After World War I, Greece, supported by Britain, occupied parts of western Anatolia (including Smyrna) with hopes of reclaiming historic Greek lands.
- Under Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, Greek forces advanced deep into Anatolia, but Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), employed a strategic retreat.
- Once reorganized, Kemal’s forces counterattacked and pushed the Greeks back west. **Smyrna was deliberately set on fire**, resulting in large-scale destruction and death in the tens to hundreds of thousands. By the end of 1922, **over a million Greek refugees** had been driven out of what is now Turkey.

### The British perspective on Jews was prejudiced and consequential to the shape of the modern Middle East

- Antisemitic:
	- **Ottoman CUP Conspiracies:** Some British diplomats believed the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) was secretly under Jewish or “crypto-Jewish” control, seeing Freemasonry as a Jewish front to subvert the Ottoman Empire.
	- **Bolshevik Connection:** Similarly, after the Russian Revolution, British officials promoted the idea that the Bolsheviks were dominated by Jews—tying together Germany’s wartime maneuvers (Lenin’s “sealed train” operation was masterminded by Alexander Lvovich Parvus, born Israel Lazarevich Gelfand) with a broader fear of a “Jewish Peril”, the English translation of the Russian authored "Protocols of the Elders of Zion".
	- **Colonial Administrators’ Biases:** In Palestine, British officials on the ground sometimes held antisemitic or “Arabist” leanings, believing that Zionism complicated local governance and risking friction with Muslim communities.
- Pro-Jewish:
	- **Christian Zionism:** Some British leaders—e.g., David Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour—were deeply influenced by Christian religious convictions. They felt sympathy for the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine.
	- **Strategic Interests:** Others saw Zionism as a way to secure a loyal population in a key location near the Suez Canal route and to prevent other European powers (notably France) from dominating the Holy Land.
- Divisions among Britain's Jews:
	- **Edwin Samuel Montagu:** The first British cabinet minister who was Jewish, Montagu strongly opposed Zionism. He argued that equating “Jewishness” with a separate national identity undermined the status of British Jews who considered Britain their homeland.
	- **Herbert Samuel:** Another prominent Jewish politician who did favor some form of British-backed Jewish settlement in Palestine; he saw it partly in spiritual/religious terms and partly in strategic terms for the British Empire.
- In his 1920 article **Zionism Versus Bolshevism**, Churchill created a taxonomy of politically active Jews, noting that it was a critical time for Jews to decide between good (Zionism or Nationalism) and evil (Bolshevism).

### The Enver, Djemal and Talaat Pasha triumvirate of the dying days of the Ottoman empire was both colorful and extremely terrible

- **CUP Dominance:** The Committee of Union and Progress effectively took over the Ottoman government after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution and a subsequent coup. By 1913, these "Three Pashas" held near-dictatorial power in the Ottoman empire.
- They were **Turkish supremacists**, sidelining non-Turkish Muslim groups (e.g., Arabs, Kurds) and clamped down on Christian minorities (e.g., Armenians, Greeks), and **allied with Germany** to modernize Ottoman military power and reassert control by partnering with the Central Powers.
- **Armenian Genocide:** Talaat, Enver, and Djemal bear central responsibility for orchestrating the mass deportations and killings of Armenians in 1915–1916. Djemal’s brutality in particular extended to Armenian populations in Syria. **Djemal threatened the Jewish population in similar terms**, and was only [stopped by Erich von Falkenhayn](https://jcpa.org/the-german-officers-who-prevented-the-massacre-of-the-jews-of-palestine-in-world-war-i/), a German General.
- Enver Pasha initiated disastrous military campaigns, such as the **Sarikamish** operation against Russia, in which around 70,000 of his 100,000 Ottoman troops died—mostly due to freezing conditions and logistic failures.
- **Colorful exits:** Enver’s quixotic journey to Central Asia—trying to spark an anti-Bolshevik, pan-Turkic revolt—ended with his defeat and death. Djemal and Talaat also met violent ends, assassinated by Armenians avenging the genocide.

### The British empire was internally divided, with regional offices in direct conflict with the central government

- **Too much bureaucracy:** a hodgepodge of agencies—India Office, Foreign Office, War Office, Colonial Office—each with overlapping authority over Middle Eastern affairs
- **Regional HQ rivalries:** Britain had a critical base in **Cairo (Egypt)**, another in **Delhi (for Indian affairs)**, and separate outposts in the Gulf, Iraq, and Palestine. Administrators on the ground often pursued their own agendas, contradicting broader British policy.
- **Sir Mark Sykes’s Attempt:** In 1916, Sykes envisioned a central “Middle Eastern Department” to coordinate policy. However, **Lord Kitchener** folded it back under the Egyptian administration, effectively **keeping power with Cairo** rather than with a single London-based entity.
- **Case of Palestine:** On the ground, many British administrators (the “Arabists”) sympathized with local Arab leaders and resisted London’s pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration. This tension caused repeated clashes between **local governance** and **official policy** set by the Foreign Office in London.

### The Allied alliance was very fragile and ever-shifting. This was the "Great Game"

- **Britain vs. France in the Middle East:** Despite being wartime allies, they had conflicting goals. Britain often sought to dominate strategic zones (e.g., Palestine, Mesopotamia) while France insisted on securing Syria and Lebanon, leading to ongoing tension over carving up Ottoman lands.
- **Italy’s Unfulfilled Claims:** Italy entered the war expecting significant territorial gains (including parts of the Ottoman Empire), but was ultimately shortchanged at the peace negotiations. This fueled resentment within the alliance.
- **Greek vs. Italian Friction:** While Italy vied for areas of southwestern Anatolia, Britain and France supported Greek claims to Smyrna (Izmir). This stoked immediate discord between Allies who were ostensibly on the same side
- **Collapse of Tsarist Russia:** Initially integral to Allied strategy, Russia abruptly exited WWI after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which was facilitated by the Germans. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk upended Allied plans in the Middle East.
- **Betrayed Secret Deals:** Russia had been promised a share of Constantinople, but its new Bolshevik government published and then repudiated many of the Allies’ secret wartime agreements including the Sykes-Picot agreement, exposing fault lines between Britain, France, and others.
- **Separate Deals and Double-Crosses**: exhausted by war and its own internal turmoil, **France made an independent deal with the Turkish nationalists**, irritating Britain, which still backed Greek military ventures in Anatolia. **Britain cut side deals** with local Arab leaders, Zionists, and others, sometimes neglecting to inform its French or Italian allies, further undermining Allied coherence.
- **Paris Peace Conference (1919):** Britain, France, and the U.S. focused on European settlements, but each had a different vision for the postwar Middle East. Britain sought strategic control from Egypt to India; France clung to colonial ambitions in the Levant; the U.S. under Wilson was wary of old-style imperialism.
- The great powers involved in World War I, even while the war was raging, anticipated a continuation of the Great Game past the end of the war. This created fertile ground for the great game to continue into the 1920s and 1930s and from there to World War II. **It wasn't until the players were completely destroyed that the Great Game ended**. But now that the hegemony is over, they are beginning again.

### Churchill had an outsized influence in WW1 too

- **Pre-WWI Government Roles:** Churchill was elected to Parliament as early as 1900. By the 1910s, he rose to First Lord of the Admiralty (in charge of the Royal Navy).
- **Dreadnought Race:** Churchill focused on **modernizing Britain’s navy** and preserving its lead over Germany’s growing fleet. He felt compelled, for instance, to **seize two Ottoman battleships** under construction in British shipyards to bolster the Royal Navy.
- **Gallipoli Campaign:** Churchill vigorously supported an attack on the Dardanelles, aiming to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war by capturing Constantinople. This **naval assault followed by a land invasion** at Gallipoli proved a massive Allied failure, costing hundreds of thousands of casualties.
- **Reappearance in Government:** Despite the Gallipoli debacle, Churchill soon returned to high office. By 1921–1922, he served as **Colonial Secretary**, overseeing Britain’s new Middle Eastern mandates (Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine) that emerged from the Ottoman collapse.

### Random bits

- Uncle Sam Wants You is in fact a rip-off of [[Lord Kitchener Wants You]].
- Pan-Arabism is largely a British invention imposed on the Arab world. This includes the Pan-Arabic flag, an initially British designed and British produced item.


John Dee and the Empire of Angels by Jason Louv

I liked this book, although it could use a bit of additional structure. It came across my radar from a [podcast conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6P5LUsfRxE) between Rick Rubin and Jason Louv about the book. Although it exaggerates and studies Dee in arguably too much depth, it paints a fascinating picture of the Elizabethan age.

Dee's life began at the start of the Lutheran Reformation. In 1543 when Dee was sixteen, two monumental works were published: On the Structure of the Human Body, by Andreas Vesalius, and On the Revolutions of Celestial Bodies, by Copernicus, but the Royal Society was still a century away. In 1608, a year before Dee's death, Hans Lippershey invented the first telescope. Dee's was a liminal life in a transitional age. Quoth the book:

> Dee is an inexhaustible subject. In life, he stood at the crossroads between magic and science, between the medieval and the modern, between Protestantism and Catholicism, and between the terrestrial and celestial worlds themselves.

Dee himself had some scientific contributions, and wrote extensively on optics, astronomy, mechanics, inventing a pulley system for moving heavy weights that would gain popular use later in the century. Dee's interest in optics led him to a reputation for sorcery after he "conjured" an illusion of a flying scarab with a man on its back, terrifying his audience.

In Dee's work Propaedeumata, he proposes that the universe is a vast machine, foreshadowing works to come like Newton's Principia. Dee suggested that God created the universe using mathematics, and that by understanding mathematics (God’s ways in the world), one could work with or even guide the forces of creation. Since man stands between God and the Creation, and is made in God’s image, he is suited to work with God as an intermediary, and mathematics is the ideal science for doing so.

Dee used Copernicus' calculations to determine that eleven days and fifty three minutes should be removed from the new Gregorian calendar, but wisely left out Copernicus' heliocentric model from his report. This was his last major scientific contribution.

Eventually Dee moved on from science and cast himself as an adept rather than just a math professor, in hopes of finding a monarch that would shelter him. However the thing Monarchs actually wanted was the same thing as usual... money and power. And so Elizabeth was busy with her own alchemical experiments, and Dee repackaged his book Monas to portray himself as an alchemist, including critiques of sham alchemists of the day, with intimations that Dee might know how to produce the philosopher's stone. Simultaneously he was writing the the “Mathematicall Praeface” to Henry Billingsley’s massively successful and influential first English translation of Euclid’s Elements of Geometry.

## Critique: overly bombastic

Following Dame Francis Yates' "The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age", Louv makes bombastic claims that Dee and Kelly's influence on the western world was central to European, English, and American spirituality, geopolitics, and empire.

> The influence of Dee and the angelic system he and Kelly delivered to the world can be found in an astonishing number of the major turning points of Western history since Dee’s death—in the birth of modern science, in the creation of the secret societies that liberalized Europe and gave America its spiritual calling, in the creation of the state of Israel and its subsequent centrality to American foreign policy, and even in the genesis of the United States space program.

These statements are highly specious and reductive. Louv writes:

> Indeed, just as the work of St. Paul is responsible for turning the ideas of a Jewish messianic sect into a Holy Roman Empire, so is the work of Dr. Dee responsible for turning those of the Protestant dissenters into a global Empire of Angels.

St. Paul was one of very many contingent links for Jesus Christ to reach the prominence required to have Constantine convert the Holy Roman Empire. I don't think Louv's simplistic causal characterization is at all fair.

## The Great Chain of Being

Louv does a good job of providing context for the pre-enlightenment world Dee was born into. The canonical classification of divine and profane beings comes to us from the sixth century Christian Pseudo-Dionysius. He scaffolded the order of the world as follows:

Angels of presence, praising God:

- Seraphim speculate on the order and providence of God.
- Cherubim speculate on the essence and form of God.
- Thrones also speculate, though some descend to works.

Angels of government, spreading light:

- Dominions, like architects, design what the rest execute.
- Virtues execute, and move the heavens, and concur for the working of miracles as God’s instruments.
- Powers watch that the order of divine governance is not interrupted and some of them descend to human things.

Angels of revelation, able to communicate with humans:

- Principalities care for public affairs, nations, princes, magistrates.
- Archangels direct the divine cult and look after sacred things.
- Angels look after smaller affairs, and take charge of individuals as their guardian angels.

The Profane:

- Humans are in the unfortunate position of being able to commit both spiritual and physical sins—unlike angels and animals, who are either fully spiritual or fully physical.
- Animals, ranked within various orders—mammals, avians, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects.
- Plants, ranked in order from trees to fungus.
- Minerals, ranked by gems, metals, stones, and so on.

## Scientists on the woo spectrum

Many great scientists work on the frontier of the known. Thus they encounter plenty of ideas which are not tested and confirmed by the scientific community. As a forward thinking explorer of the unknown, some of your swings may end up as mega-hits, while others might be complete misses. As you do the work, they all look promising. It is only in retrospect that you can separate the scientific contributions from the occult tendencies:

| Person                           | Scientific contribution                | Occult tendency            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Isaac Newton (b. 1643)           | Calculus, light waves, laws of motion. | Alchemy and Rosicrucianism |
| Srinivasa Ramanujan (b. 1887)    | Number Theory contributions            | The goddess Mahalakshmi    |
| John Whiteside Parsons (b. 1914) | Solid-fuel rockets                     | Thelemite occultism        |
| John Nash (b. 1928)              | Game Theory contributions              | Aliens                     |

Louv writes eloquently about the occult's relation to science and religion:

> The occult occupies a treacherous liminal zone between the competing discourses of science and religion, both of which reject it. It is tiny, decentralized, largely overlooked by modern culture, unpoliced by the processes of licensing or peer review, and concerned with entirely subjective aspects of the human experience, making it a no-man’s land where scientists, if not angels, fear to tread.

Related to [[Science and religion are deeply compatible]].

## Dee's Mortlake library was extensive and frequented by Queen Elizabeth

Dee pitched the concept for a national library to Queen Mary but it was rejected. Instead he expanded his personal library at Mortlake, which grew to be the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.

During Dee’s life, Cambridge possessed only 451 books and manuscripts; Oxford, 379. Dee probably had about 2,000 books and 198 manuscripts at Mortlake.

> Elizabeth would regularly ride to Mortlake to visit Dee and his stacks. Dee’s network of contacts continued to encompass scientists, intellectuals, and foreign courtiers from across the British Isles and Europe. He kept company with many of the era’s leading lights, including the explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake, Abraham Ortelius (creator of the atlas), Elizabeth’s spymaster Francis Walsingham, and the astronomer and alchemist Tycho Brahe.

Upon his return from Eastern Europe, Dee found his collection ransacked and destroyed.

## Catholics vs protestants

Queen Mary (ruled 1553 - 1558), a devout catholic was named Bloody Mary by her protestant opponents. She attempted to reverse the English reformation and was not an intellectual.

Mary's successor Elizabeth I (ruled 1558 — 1603), nominally a Protestant, had a "coldly realpolitik view of faith". She was a child prodigy who grew up to be one of the greatest monarchs in English history. Dee became her astrological and scientific advisor, advocating for England's voyages of discovery and colonization, and coining the term "British Empire". Dee signed his letters to Elizabeth "007". The two circles symbolized the eyes of Queen Elizabeth (for your eyes only) and seven was the alchemist’s lucky number.

Dee himself vacillated between Protestantism and Catholicism depending on the political headwinds. Seeking to stay on Mary's good side, he became an ordained priest in one day. Louv observes the fierce battle between Catholicism and Protestantism, noting the relative tameness of Dee's more deeply held Hermeticist leanings.

> Alchemy and sorcery permeated society, but reality itself was also a battle ground between two metamagical systems—Catholicism and Protestantism. Beyond shared religious mythology, Catholicism had its saints, fetishes, sacraments, rituals, inter-cessionary prayer, and other magical technologies; while Protestantism had its evangelical fury and emphasis on individual relationship with Christ. Next to such intense systems of belief, whose wars extended to torture and mass murder, Dee’s Hermeticism looks positively sober—the forerunner of the science that would begin to emancipate humanity.

Dee often found himself in trouble over his religious beliefs, found by the French inquisition to be "not evil, but mad" and imprisoned briefly in 1564.

## What is Hermeticism

I once attempted a lecture about Gnosticism. I quickly abandoned it. Yet here I managed to glean some details about what Hermeticism was all about:

> Protestantism was only one of the belief structures challenging or running parallel to Catholicism. The others were Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and operative magic—three distinct yet intertwining schools of thought that informed the literate elite’s direct quest for divine knowledge, beyond the rote teachings of the Church.

> Hermeticism itself was a long-standing school of philosophy drawn from the study of the Corpus hermeticum, the magical texts attributed to the Egyptian priest, king, and philosopher Hermes Trismegistus, believed to be a contemporary and spiritual equal of Moses, which thus formed a source of wisdom on par with the Old Testament itself.

> Primary among these texts is the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, a book first appearing in Arabic sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries, and translated into Latin in the twelfth, which contains the root precepts of the entire genre.

> By the sixteenth century, interest in Hermeticism and Neoplatonism was growing among the European intellectual elite. And while Hermetic texts had long been jealously guarded and carefully written in code, the printing press was undoing much of that secrecy, bringing alarming new ideas to receptive minds.

> To use a modern metaphor, if the universe is a computer with its own finely ordered operating system, file structure, and languages, Hermeticism and Neoplatonism sought to understand the workings of the computer, while operative magic sought to program it.

## Christian Zionism and specious claims

Louv draws a direct causal link from modern American Christian Zionism to Dee's occult beliefs and practices. It feels to me like Dee's role here is exaggerated, but I think the ideological causality is right.

According to [a Pew poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2007/01/11/the-promised-land-and-the-second-coming/), one in three Americans believes that the state of Israel is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy of Christ's return.

Louv claims that Christian Zionists believe:

> that Britain’s failure to work toward a full Jewish state, and America’s urgent insistence on doing so, is responsible for the collapse of the British Empire and the transfer of global imperial primacy to America.

During Dee's time, Protestant groups practiced “Judaizing” by leaning into the Old Testament. The Puritans in particular rejected the residual Catholicism of the Church of England and wanted to live like God's original chosen people. When they left for American shores, they became American evangelicals.

Louv writes that during World War II,

> many Christian Zionists saw Hitler’s persecution of the Jews as a part of the divine plan to push Jews toward returning to Palestine and converting to Christianity. They therefore saw little need for America to intervene to prevent the Holocaust from occurring.

Louv includes a telling quote from Ronald Reagan:

> “For the first time ever, everything is in place for the battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Christ."

I'm intrigued by the ideology of Christian Zionism. Although they are some of the strongest defenders of Jews in the US, there is also a dark anti-semitic undercurrent, in that their concern is less about the well-being of the Jewish people as much as their use in bringing forth the apocalypse to ultimately "de-Judaize" them.

I found nothing to confirm Louv's claim that:

> Remarkably, John Dee’s fellow magus Isaac Newton predicted 1948 as the year of the Jews’ return to Palestine.

Having said that, Newton did predict the end of the world in 2060. Hopefully I'll live to see it. Wait I mean...

### The "British" Empire

At the time, Spain was the dominant Empire, extracting massive amounts of silver from its New World colonies. This in part led to the obsession about alchemy: to tip the balance of economic power.

The only credible challenger to Spain at the moment was Portugal, who had split the New World along the line determined by the Treaty of Tordesillas (see [Late Middle Ages](/books/late-middle-ages/)). Dee suggested the Queen make some changes:

> Dee, with his back pocket full of superior knowledge of geography, navigation, and optics, would soon suggest Elizabeth contest this, and expand into the New World not just to rival Catholic domination, but for economic growth.

Dee masterminded Drake's mission which resulted in a landing at Drake's Beach north of San Francisco. Further expeditions included one by Frobisher, where two ships, the Gabriel and Michael, named after two prominent archangels, were sent and discovered a sample of black ore which was believed to contain gold. This spurred an additional voyage which returned with 200 tons of it, but the ore turned out to be pyrite, a worthless fool's gold.

In November 1577, Dee presented a new imperial plan to Elizabeth, suggesting that England wrest control of the New World from Spain. Dee argued that Britain needed a continually operational navy, and that it also had natural advantages for the maritime trades.

> Establishing such a navy would make Britain nigh-on invincible (it did), and expansion of the British Navy and colonization of the New World not only had historical precedent but would surely raise vast riches for the Crown (it did).

Dee wrote explicitly that the Petty Navy Royal should have sixty 120-200 ton "tall ships", and twenty small warships staffed by thousands of men funded by taxation. Dee argued that this would pay for itself, as the wealth gained by taxation would trickle down to the English people.

## Arthurian New World?

Dee held the bizarre belief that America had been colonized by King Arthur and that his still-existing Arthurian colonies might be found in the Northwest Passage. Dee drew up maps on the foundation of the Arthurian claim to the New World sprawled from Florida to Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean.

> Mercator himself had written to Dee that King Arthur had sent an expedition of four thousand men into the seas near the North Pole, and that some of the members of the team had survived, with their descendants appearing at court in Norway in 1364. Also of interest was the Welsh legend of Madoc, a prince who supposedly explored the New World in 1170;

Dee’s use of the term "British" Empire long predated the use of the word British to mean the British Isles; it referred instead to Arthur’s legendary Britain.

Of course, voyages to the New World would fail to turn up any evidence of Arthurian settlements, undermining Dee’s claims.

## Hebrew and Enochian

Like Postel and Bacon, Dee thought the forces of creation were encoded into Hebrew, although even Hebrew would be an echo of the hypothesized primal language.

> The angelic language, Sledge argues, “begins to exist somewhere between being created and being discovered by Kelly under a state of increasingly pronounced epistemological inclusivity between the angelic revelation, his own thoughts, and the dizzying array of alterations in his consciousness brought on by the effects of the sessions themselves and/or mental illness.”

> As part of the process of transmitting the forty-nine calls, and elsewhere in the diaries, the angels delivered fragments of the angelic language itself—often referred to as Enochian (this is a later conceit, not contained in the original spirit diaries). This was the language spoken in the Garden of Eden; when Adam was corrupted by the demon Coronzom in the form of the serpent and exiled east of Eden, he had to invent the Hebrew language instead, which contained an echo of the angelic language—though without the true forms or pronunciation.

[Dee's Enochian alphabet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian#/media/File:Enochian_letters_(1583_manuscript).png>)

## Dee and Kelly's scrying sessions

Dee and Kelly's scrying sessions were bizarre. They often featured angels and archangels appearing in their midst and providing divine prophecy. The archangel Gabriel spoke to them on June 2, 1584. The archangel Uriel manifested a crystal out of thin air, to be used by Kelly as his scrying device. Through this medium, Dee and Kelly were given complex instructions for building temple furniture and other very detailed rituals:

> A gold ring upon which is written the name “PELE” that is to be worn by the working magician and corresponds to the Seal of Solomon, the ring said to be worn by King Solomon, who appears in 1 Kings, and used to command the demons with which he built his temple.

The sessions ranged from comical:

> However, Michael was still unimpressed. On April 28—five weeks since the previous action—he chided Dee and Kelly for their slackness in carrying out his instructions. Dee pleaded that he hadn’t had money to buy materials to make the lamen, ring, or Sigillum.

To completely psychedelic:

> Two birds reappeared, as big as mountains now, flying toward space. The first bird took stars into his bill, while the second took the stars from the first and put them back into the sky; they quickly repeated this process throughout the heavens. These birds now flew over cities and towns, breaking up the clouds and causing dust to fall from the walls and towers, thereby cleaning them. In the streets were “diverse brave fellows”—bishops, princes, and kings—that the wings of the birds struck down, while beggars, the infirm, children, women, and the elderly were left untouched.

> Now the birds lifted the corpses of four men from the ground, each of them wearing crowns, one of which was a child. Upon being raised into the air they parted into the four cardinal directions. Coming now to a great hill, the birds squeezed metals from the ground and threw them out; next tossing the withered head of an old man between their feet until it cracked open, revealing a stone the size of a tennis ball colored white, black, red, and green—the colors of the Watchtowers that would be later transmitted, and of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. Upon eating the stone, the birds became two men with bright white paper crowns, with gold teeth, hands, feet, tongues, eyes, and ears. On each were twenty-six gold crowns, and they carried bags of gold that they sowed upon the earth like seeds.

The scrying sessions continued in exile in Poland and the Czech Republic with more intense visions:

> Uriel transformed into a great spinning wheel of fire; after thrusting out his hands, the wheel appeared full of men’s eyes, with flames shooting out of it in four places. A great white eagle with monstrous red eyes, one the color of fire and one of crystal, now came and perched upon the wheel, carrying a scroll of parchment in its beak. Beneath this eagle appeared a great valley, within which was a great city six times the size of Krakow, full of ruined houses, with a river running by it.

(I want to feed this into a gen AI video maker...)

## Wife swapping

At some point in the scrying sessions Kelly was implored to marry. He indeed soon married, though he came to greatly resent his wife.

Later, while in Třeboň, Dee and Kelly were told by Madimi, an angel from their vision, that they must share everything they had, including their wives, in order to complete the first phase of the Apocapylse.

Understandably, their wives were appalled. Dee told Jane Dee that "the wife sharing had to occur; there was no other way". Kelly went through and consummated, but Dee did not. Unsurprisingly, this was the end of the line for Dee and Kelly's friendly collaboration:

> Dee, who had already given everything for his cause, and sacrificed all that he had gained for the promise of angelic insight, had now been taken by his partner—for his contacts, his status, his knowledge, his alchemical equipment, and even his wife’s favors, leaving Dee destitute and possibly with a son not of his own parentage.

## Dee in literature and legacy

Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus is an example of anti-occult sentiment of the late 16th century. Its titular character is likely based in part on Dee himself. Ben Jonson’s The Alchemist (1610) was also inspired by Dee’s legend, with both plays casting their respective sorcerers as tragic victims of their own ambitions. Prospero of Shakespeare's The Tempest is also likely to be inspired by John Dee.

> Instead of facing a martyr’s death, Dee had been pushed out of polite society and forced to bear the constant humiliation of dashed hopes. Even his neighbors soon refused to offer him loans.

Louv also argues that Dee deeply inspired Francis Bacon, although Dee became untouchable because of his association with sorcery, and was not explicitly mentioned in Bacon's writing.

> Bacon nowhere mentions Dee in his two works, though he surely stood on the great educator’s shoulders. He also makes no mention of mathematics, still inseparably connected to Dee in the English mind. These omissions, Yates argues, were not from oversight or lack of debt, but because Bacon feared repeating Dee’s treatment by James I.

And Francis Bacon is the guiding spirit of the Royal Society. Again I find this to be a pretty tenuous link, but as I read this book, I mentally replaced Dee with the _je ne sais quoi_ spirit of the Elizabethan age Dee represented.

## Dee's occult descendents

Edward Alexander Crowley founded a modern Magick order called Thelema. His books like "The vision and the Voice" reveals a complex cosmology that sounds intriguing, at least in Louv's retelling, especially as it relates to [[Negative theology and via negativa]].

However the historical details are grim. Crowley appears to be a terrible person individually, while also promulgating a variety of questionable practices: perverse sex, hard drugs, mind control. He is also a self-declared antichrist. In summary, a rather unattractive package, for example:

> Crowley’s rather cowardly refusal to help several men trapped by an avalanche during his Kanchenjunga expedition; his decades of cocaine, ether, and heroin addiction and the resultant ugly interpersonal behaviors these drugs engender; his often sociopathic treatment of women, students, and hired help; his extreme racism and anti-Semitism (including a line in his Magical and Philosophical Commentaries, III:11, in which he calls Jews “the parasites of man,” which has been deleted from later editions), and so on . . . and so on . . . and so on

Louv's account of the various offshots of Dee's esoterics is long and esoteric, covering weird persons associated with Crowley's A∴A∴, such as Charles Stansfeld Jones who in Vancouver founded the first Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) lodge in North America.

But then he switches gears a bit and catches my attention again with the figure of John Whiteside Parsons, a sci-fi fan, Enochian magician, JPL founder, and inventor of solid rocket propellant.

> Parsons straddled the worlds of science and the occult. Like Dee, he saw centuries ahead of his time. Like Dee, his personality was too complex and interests too far-reaching to easily compartmentalize—picture Faust, Elon Musk, Hugh Hefner, and Abbie Hoffman in one man. Like Dee, he would be instrumental in expanding humanity’s horizons, in this case not just to a new continent but to new worlds, for which he would be uncredited, unthanked, and forgotten. Like Dee, he would immerse himself in Enochian magic, working the system with a charlatan associate who would betray and defraud him just as Kelly had Dee. Like Dee, he would lose everything.

Apparently inspired by Greek Fire, Parsons developed GALCIT-53, solid-state rocket fuel, solving problems with previously too-volatile formulations.

In 1939, along with the rest of the Thelema crew, Parsons rented a mansion called Agape Lodge, an experiment in communal living inspired by Parsons' Marxism and Crowley's Abbey of Thelema:

> This was a forerunner of the similar experiments of the Beat and hippie generations to come. Parsons was soon reveling in orgies, ritual magic, drug use and abuse, polyamorous hysterics.

He began composing Vogon poetry:

> I height Don Quixote,
> I live on Peyote, marihuana, morphine, and cocaine.
> I never knew sadness but only a madness that burns at the heart and the brain.

Parsons short life took a turn for the worse after he met L. Ron Hubbard. Together they begin their own sessions, Parsons acting as evoker and Hubbard acting as the scryer, mirroring the Dee-Kelly partnership. I had previously known of L. Ron Hubbard only for his involvement in Scientology and for his famous bet with Frank Herbert. This adds additional color to the demented man.

Like Dee and Kelly, they ventured deeply into the occult and sexual, with Parsons meeting Marjorie Cameron, a new tenant at the Lodge, who he decided was the Scarlet Woman, also known as Babalon. Meanwhile Hubbard's scrying began to increasingly resemble science fiction writing.

Parsons was like Dee:

- Both responded to the pain of rejection and the collapse of their scientific careers by retreating into the world of the occult.
- Both would be cuckolded, with Dee giving his wife over to Kelly, and Parsons being taken by Hubbard for his young girlfriend Betty.
- Both would be taken advantage of financially. Hubbard convinced Parsons to buy three yachts in Miami, which they would sail through the Panama Canal to the West Coast and then sell at a profit. As soon as Parsons agreed, Hubbard absconded to Miami with his money and Betty, leaving Parsons broke.

L. Ron Hubbard sounds like a total piece of shit. Parson's short life ended in tragedy, at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion in 1952.

Louv has a very specific interpretation of Super Bowl XLIX:

> As the personification of female sexual liberation, anti-Christianity, open sexuality, witchcraft, and the occult, Babalon is much more popular in our current world than Christ—so much so that in 2015, Katy Perry appeared as Babalon herself at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, the largest and most central spectacle of mainstream American life. Bedecked in scarlet red flames, Perry emerged onto the field riding a towering portrayal of the solar, golden Beast, afterward dancing on a Masonic checkerboard while asking her viewers if they wanted to “play with magic” and telling them, as Babalon does in “Liber Cheth” and “The Book of Babalon,” that “once you’re mine, there’s no going back". This monumental and compelling spectacle, which greatly upset conservative Christians, nonetheless drew over 118.5 million viewers—the largest audience in Super Bowl history, and most certainly for a Thelemic ritual. It is hard to imagine a more definitive symbol of Crowley’s Thelemic worldview, and Babalon herself, winning the culture war. It’s a long journey from the visions of two English alchemists in 1587 to the Super Bowl halftime 428 years later, but then, goddesses presumably think on a long timeline.

I can't tell if Louv is joking. Did the producers of Katy Perry's act think about the Whore of Babalon when the produced it? Did conservative Christians truly react negatively to it?

Anyway, a provocative and intriguing but very esoteric read.
