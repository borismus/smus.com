Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman
===

cover: /assets/book-covers/good-omens.jpg

I picked this one up on Sr. B's recommendation and enjoyed it in multi-voice audiobook form. Overall, a fun listen. Very (in-)effable(?). Lots of jokes and satirical observations reminiscent of Doug Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and I think way more Pratchett than Gaiman.

I couldn't help but wonder which of the two authors identified and wrote more of the demon Crowley and the angel Aziraphale. Their hilarious and love-hate dynamic reminded me of the starkly different and far more self-serious duo depicted in [[This is How You Lose the Time War]].

On that more serious note, Good Omens explores the possibility of Angels, Demons, and God having a free will. As the end of the world nears it becomes clear that the great conflict of this book is not between good and evil. Both sides act wrongly, and dream only of a war of total annihilation in which one of them wins and the other loses. A zero-sum game. In a real sense, the Biblical "good" is also evil.

Instead, the real struggle is between forces that want the world to end, and those that, despite all imperfections, would prefer it to continue. Framed this way, I am reminded a lot of Carse (see [[Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse]]). And when the world of course doesn't end, my stance against millenarianism is only strengthened (see [[Millenarianism is always wrong]]).

Little notes:

- Adam Young is well named
- "Piss artist" is a great expression
- I knew all the "ineffable" jokes seemed familiar, and I must have recalled Dirk Gently, to whom I leave the last word:

> Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable, let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.


Mystery Teachings by J. M. Greer

cover: /assets/book-covers/mystery-teachings.jpg

Ecology, complexity, and other interdisciplinary fields can easily slip into woo. Initially I expected this book to suffer from this problem, but luckily there were no dizzying invocations of Deepak Chiopra™ style quantum physics. Instead, Greer presents a grounded worldview, rejecting spiritual stereotypes and "half truths that you create your own reality".

The bulk of Greer's book features seven laws, which may be better described as perspectives or lenses. The first three are foundational, the fourth is a bridge, and the last three are somewhat derived from the first. Many of these so-called laws overlap with one another. Law of Planes and Law of Evolution are highly interrelated. Why are there seven laws? For relatively unconvincing reasons resembling gematria. I found these "laws" unevenly resonant, with the Law of Cause and Effect quite uninspiring, but others much more evocative.

(The [[Seven Fundamental Laws of Spiritual Ecology]] are well documented, so rather than enumerating them I'll just focus on the ideas across the laws that I found compelling.)

**An alternative entry point to complex systems** Greer's first three laws can be cleanly mapped to the canon of complexity science. Wholeness is all about the world consisting of complex adaptive systems. Flow is about stocks and flows. Finally, balance is about balancing feedback loops.

**Everything flows at different rates**. Flow rates vary, often moving at a pace far slower or faster than humans are capable of perceiving:

> the boulder left by a glacier on one corner of the meadow during the last ice age fifteen thousand years ago is slowly being weathered away by rain, wind, and the slow action of lichens, and fifteen thousand years from now, it will be a fraction of its present size. Solid as it seems, the stone is also flowing.

Perhaps there is a general scaling law that the smaller, the faster, and the higher the frequency? (Also see [[Small animals perceive time more quickly]] and [[Smaller objects move faster]])

**Accumulation is poison** because it effectively stops the natural flow of things. My initial reaction to this was one of skepticism: some accumulations seem alright. Organisms need a store of energy to survive. Accumulation also afford freedom. Freedom to consider something other than just constant toil for the purpose of survival.

Greer seems less judgmental about accumulation in the human realm, especially when this is for the future of one’s own life. He explicitly rejects that material wealth is an evil thing and the only right path is one of abject poverty. Instead, in the spirit of seeking a middle way (see [[Middle way in Buddhism]]), Greer suggests something that resonates with me:

> If material wealth is flowing into your life, material wealth in some form should be flowing out of it at an equal rate.

**Goldilocks zones and balance**: The opposite of thirst is not too much water, it’s just enough water. By default, people seek extremes and this intuition is often wrong. This section evoked a lot of related ideas for me:

- [[Balancing loops are goal seeking]]
- [[Active stability is related to non-equilibrium systems]]
- [[Goldilocks principle]]
- [[Too much of a virtue becomes a vice]]
- [[Scale causes ossification]]
- [[Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization]]
- [[People favor addition over subtraction]]

**Principle of rebound**: Intriguingly, Greer writes about a practical application of his Law of Balance. Deliberately push a balanced system one way, and you will make it swing back the other way with redoubled force. Fast so that you enjoy food more during the next days. This is a sort of synthesized delayed gratification. Related to [[Manufactured suffering for resilience, antifragility and happiness]].

**Constraints are a source of power and elegance**: Like the flow of water through a thinning tube, as the tube thins, the flow will become more and more powerful.

> Power is born when a flow of energy encounters firm limits, and the more narrow the outlet left open by those limits, the greater the power will be.

This resonated with me, and reminded me of the benefit of constraints:

- [[Constraints can be good for innovation]]
- [[Judaism encourages robust debate within constraints]]
- [[Benefits of manufactured childhood rebellion]]

I found that reframing beauty as "elegance" is generative, and fits well with Greer's example of bird flight, in which nature "engineered" or "designed" an elegant system:

> To achieve the power of flight, sparrows and most other birds accept strict and inflexible limits that prevent them from engaging in many activities that other living things can do. These limits are anything but arbitrary; rather, they are the other side of the power of flight itself.

Every manifestation in the real world is limited. If you break through these limits, you don't thrive, you die.

> When a cell ignores the limits placed on it by the body as a whole system and instead grows in an unlimited way, doctors call that condition "cancer." Freed from all limits, the human body would not become something superhuman; it would simply turn into a puddle of red slush, powerless, ugly, and dead.

**Overlapping planes of mind and body**: Greer's notion of planes is very abstract: "Everything exists and functions on one of several planes of being." The most concrete and interesting planes are the mind and the body plane. These planes interact, but only in very specific ways.

**Ecosystem lifecycles**: One intriguing idea in this chapter and the next was about the lifecycle of ecosystems:

> Just as every creature begins with a single cell and passes through its life cycle, every ecosystem begins with bare, nonliving elements and passes through stages, called "sers." Those stages reach from the first or pioneer sere that forms on bare ground right up to the final relatively stable sere, which ecologists call "the climax community."

(Also see the excellent Wikipedia article on this topic. [Climax community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_community) and [Seral community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seral_community)).

> A seral community is an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community

**Placeholders in ecosystems**: I found powerful the idea that individuals in an ecosystem can be seen as placeholders. The organism may die, but its immediate life wasn't that important for the whole system. The individual was playing a role that many had played in the past, and many will play in the future.

> The meadow in which the mouse and the grass thrive, in other words, is simply one phase of a greater process of change that began long before either one was born, and that meadow will continue long after both have died.

Furthermore, this role can be played by a variety of creatures that evolve, but are still fundamentally of the same lineage.

> Ten million years ago, some other species of small rodent filled the same role in meadow ecologies in the same region that the field house fills today, and ten million years from now, todays field mouse will likely be replaced by another species of rodent or some other creature not too different.

**Magic is about the mind**: Greer has a very hard boiled, realist take on magic. It mainly operates on the “plane of the mind”, and affects other planes only insofar as they overlap to the mind one. He talks lucidly of real limits when it comes to what you can expect magic to be able to achieve.

**Societal lifecycles**: Greer compares societies to ecosystems and suggests that they too have lifecycle. But what are the seres, and what is the climax community for societies? Perhaps the notion of progress is less clear.

> Each human society arises out of the chaos left behind by some previous society and it takes shape in response to whatever challenge the old society couldn’t meet.

This reminds me of Turchin ([[Fathers-and-sons cycles]]) as well as Tainter ([[Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter]]). But there is less of a clear sense of progress from one society to the next. This rhymes with the nonlinearity of moral progress (see [[Moral progress is a cycle, technological progress is an arrow]]).

> It is unfortunately common for the people of one society to ignore the hard won wisdom of older societies and suffer as a result.

**Technological lifecycles?** Greer goes further. He wouldn’t be surprised if at the end of our industrial society in several decades, many of today’s tech will become the stuff of legend. Atlantis, an advanced but lost civilization is a common trope in mystery schools. All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.

> The people of Atlantis ignored the laws of spiritual ecology and by the time those laws finished with them, nothing remained of Atlantis but gray waves rolling across empty ocean.

**Dealing with higher ideals vs. disappointing realities**: paraphrasing Greer, there are a few options:

1. Settle for the world as it is, optimizing for pleasure and profit.
2. Turn to ordinary religion with the hope of a better world after death.
3. Join social movements or political activism to make the world a better place.
4. Convince yourselves that changing your own thinking will scale up.
5. Sit and wait for some apocalyptic event to make the world live up to our expectations.

> Yet there is also another way: the way of the mysteries. This way starts by realizing that our everyday life in the world of manifestation, here and now, exactly as it is, is a lesson to be studied and understood, rather than a trap to be escaped or an illusion to be ignored. It goes on to recognize that the same laws that shape our ecological relationships with the world around us also define our existence in the subtler realms of mind and spirit and that learning to live and act in harmony.

I like Greer's call to curiosity, but it seems to me that the mystery schools are just one of many different ways to study and understand the lessons from daily life. Still, I'm pleasantly surprised how neatly Greer's ideas map onto my existing canon of Complexity-related notes. Also, it's useful to find giant gaps in my understanding of ecology (e.g. sers, climax communities, etc) will surely make for an illuminating follow-up.


Technofeudalism by Yanis Varoufakis
===
posted: Mar 1, 2024
rating: no
cover: /assets/book-covers/technofeudalism.jpg

Varoufakis' book is written as a missive to his late socialist father, as an attempt to answer his question “Now that computers speak to each other, will capitalism self-destruct or become unassailable?”. His answer is confidently that capitalism has already metastasized into something much worse, characterized by a highly centralized Big Tech sector which engages in rent seeking behavior. He sensationally calls this diagnosis Technofeudalism, and his remedies are unconvincing.

**Manufacturing demand post-WW2**: Going beyond Zeihan (see [[The End of the World Is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan]]), Varoufakis elaborates on how the WW2-era war machine was turned into a consumer-facing economy. He describes the period between WW2 and now as one in which the US established global hegemony. This soviet-esque centrally planned war economy was a great success. During the war, America's manufacturing machine grew so large that once the war was over and it switched to consumer goods, it would overflow the US market. As a result, there was a need to manufacture more demand domestically, and to create international demand for American goods. Thus in addition to robust advertisement at home, we needed America's exported global culture. (Lots of overlap with Adam Curtis' Century of the Self, and a reference to [Mad Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-HR88uPBU))

**Sacking the commons**: Varoufakis claims that large paradigm shifts aren’t just technological but first social. For the internet age, he describes a politically sanctioned plunder of the internet commons. This was followed by the invention of page rank and other tech.

Provocative analogy of common protocols of internet 1.0 (IMAP, SMTP, HTTP) to the British forests. Both used to be public, but became increasingly privatized and exploited for its resources for personal and corporate gain.

**Incentivizing over-complication**: Bankers are incentivized to make complex instruments that are not well understood by the public. Big tech employees are similarly incentivized to do the same, creating complex systems to dazzle promotion committees with their sheer ambition and scalability and level of abstraction. [[Simplicity is underrated at Big Tech]]

**Rents vs. profits**: Varoufakis rails against rent seeking as something that is actively destructive in the tradition of Adam Smith. His argument is that when rental income dominates corporate profits, you end up with a sort of degenerative capitalism that he calls feudalism. But how is rent different than profit fundamentally?

- Profits is reduced by competition while rent is not. If my neighbor landlords raise rents, my rent also goes up.
- Branding extracts not just profits but “brand rents”, which let them accrue value for “nothing”
- (He doesn't mention this, but presumably we want to avoid monopolies too. In a monopoly you end up with only one winner taking the whole pie.)

**Capitalism ➡ Technofeudalism**: Varoufakis' main argument is that modern capitalism has changed over the last decades, and no longer resembles the capitalism of the early 20th century. In particular, he blames big tech's cloud computing sector for rent seeking behavior. He calls this shift "technofeudalism" but acknowledges that this is spin — a marketing term designed to evoke the gravity of the situation. He lists many examples of cloud rent:

- Apple and Play Store are lords, charging app developer as vassals a 30% tax.
- Major cloud providers (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) charging for cloud APIs that enable all applications.
- Amazon taking a fee for selling goods in their online marketplace.

Related: [[Building on a platform is providing free R&D]]

**The remedy**: Varoufakis notes that historically, the economic left struggles with offering a socialist vision for what the future ought to be, and attempts to remedy it by providing one. His vision is extremely multifaceted and includes many huge ideas, many of which he devotes fewer than a paragraph to. They include:

- Democratic corporations: divide post tax profits into tranches: fixed costs, salaries, bonuses.
- Mostly egalitarian: each employee owns exactly one share of their company.
- Bonuses: determined by Eurovision style tokens, similar to peer bonuses at Google.
- Everything will be run by the committees, at various levels. Very anarchist.
- Sortition: random delegates are chosen to represent some committees (see [[Sortition prevents power hungry people from exerting too much control]]).
- Land reform: land is constantly on auction. Varoufakis doesn't bother citing Henry George, but he is clearly taking a page from his book (see [[Georgism is a constantly running auction on all land]]).
- Workers of the world unite: a global alliance of consumers, unionized workers, etc should decide to strike against all Amazon warehouses at the same time.

Like many radicals, Varoufakis suffers from the pathology of being unable to even propose a coherent desired state, let alone a path to getting there (see [[Strategy != Goals != Ambitions]]). He describes a very elaborate, broad ranging vision, and then posits that the many modifications he proposes will get us there. I'm highly skeptical that this would work, since each one of the bullet points above are big ideas on their own and would introduce dozens of second order effects. In tandem, these second order effects would only multiply, leading to some unfathomable future even a very small number of time-steps away.

Perhaps Varoufakis is well grounded on many of these interventions. He worked at Valve previously, which I think is the source of some of the ideas behind "democratic corporations", but the book ends abruptly without much detail into these actual policies. But it feels to me that going into actual policy was never his goal. "Technofeudalism" is a manifesto that describes meaty problems without seriously proposing adequate solutions.

Random:

- Bessemer process first enable large scale steel production. This enabled a lot more things to be built out of steel, such as ship hulls, which up to the 1850s were necessarily built out of wood. More in [[Diffusion of steel technology]].
- Contra the author, Thomas Edison did not actually electrocute an elephant to spread it alternating current. That’s a common misconception and draft the narrative. [[List of my own misconceptions]]
- A compelling point that crypto is just another vehicle for Wall Street now. It’ll especially clear now that BTC is part of the various retirement funds. Just another vehicle for readying existing power structures.
- Two antagonistic "super cloud fiefs". Chinese and American. But I don’t think that the Chinese superfiefdom is open for business.
- After US froze Russia central bank out of the global financial system, Varoufakis claims that it’s the first time this happened. Even during the Russia-Britain war in 1850 (Crimean war?) British and Russian bankers continued to collaborate. True?


David: The Divided Heart by David Wolpe
===
posted: Feb 23, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/david-divided-heart.jpg

I read this book as respite from Samuel I and before tackling Samuel II. Wolpe's retelling of David's stories is lively, easy to read, and insightful. Most of this book summarizes David's story from various perspectives: as a young man, on the run from Saul, as a king, as a father, at the end of his journey, and as the progenitor of the Messiah. I found Wolpe's negative insights to be the most incisive.

Wolpe observes that

> Conventional religion has a regrettable tendency to do surgery on the human soul, leaving only the exalted parts.

Not so with David. In the words of Baruch Halpern, "David is the first human being in world literature". Wolpe's overall portrait of David is not super sympathetic. David's flaws, sins, and moral failings are so great that this sentiment from former Israeli president Shimon Peres seems like an understatement:

> Not everything David did on land, or on roofs, appears to me to be Judaism.

The author of this book is my radar from a number of different directions, most surprisingly via his [interview with Sadhguru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQzPhEbyZ5g).

**The supernatural and the feminine**: With the exception of Saul raising Samuel from the dead, there is not a single supernatural miracle in the entire story of David. Wolpe observes that when David needs a miracle, God finds a woman to enact it in an earthly manner. Is this like [real life](https://youtu.be/txqiwrbYGrs?si=9PPAGRrQ5006kbis&t=15)?

**Family strife**: Wolpe writes resonantly that “for king or commoner, the pain in families dwarfs even the final, eschatological battle”. David's family is rather extreme, a wild caricature of the sorts of pedestrian problems most people experience in their life. In a modern reading, does one soften and interpret them as allegory?

- David commits both adultery and murder in one sordid chapter, sleeping with Bathsheva ("I saw her bathing on the roof") and sending her husband Uriah to die at the hands of the Ammonites.
- Nathan's prophecy that David and Bathsheba's first child would die then comes true.
- David's children reenact David's own rape-and-murder when Amnon rapes his half-sister Tamar. Tamar's brother Absalom then avenges this act by murdering Amnon. All three are David's children.
- Absalom attempts to usurp the throne from David in his moment of weakness. David flees like he fled from his stepfather Saul. Eventually David tries to spare Absalom, but his general kills his son against his will.
- David's parting words to his son and heir Solomon are ruthless: kill Joab (David's general), kill Shimei (a man from Saul's lineage), and dispatch of Adonijah (David's son). Solomon systematically executes his father's wishes and secures his succession.

I must say, recalling David's story in detail really enhances my appreciation the much loved "Hallelujah":

> But all I ever learned from love,
> Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.

Wolpe argues that David is the cho­sen of God exact­ly because of his com­plex­i­ty, which strikes me as a very modern take. Would the authors of the Bible considered complexity a desirable quality? I suspect they would laud David for being a great warrior king. A gentler modern reading is far more damning. David was "a man after God’s own heart", at the cost of sordid and tragic personal and family affairs. A broken hallelujah.


Every Life is on Fire by Jeremy England
===
posted: Feb 9, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/every-life-is-on-fire.jpg

I came across this peculiar book in a circuitous way. I listened to part of an interview in which a certain Beff Jesos spent an inordinate amount of time speculating about non-equilibrium systems and how they might relate to the genesis of life. He also casually name-dropped Jeremy England. On his lead, I read an article about some of recent research on life-like simulations that seem to spontaneously reach orderly states, and came across this book. Turns out England is not just a statistical physicist, but also an ordained rabbi, and that "Every Life is On Fire" is a strange amalgam of condensed matter theory and The Torah, which sounded right up my alley.

Overall, I found the book thought-provoking and worthwhile despite its unevenness, abrupt end, and overreliance on scripture. One obscure episode from Exodus in which God teaches Moses to turn his hand sickly white and revert it back to normal was given far too much weight, resulting in a contorted and unconvincing analogy. On the other hand, some Torah references illuminated the author's thought process, and at a meta-level, reminded me about the flexibility of human minds to synthesize across such seemingly disparate fields. Anyway here are some ideas that stood out to me:

**Escape velocity and state changes**: An intuitive and new-to-me way of looking at changes in state. Consider a particle in its transition from liquid to gas (e.g. boiling water), we can apply the concept of escape velocity. This particle is like a rocket trying to escape the gravitational field of earth. In this analogy, the earth is made out of these rocket-particles, so as more of them leave, the earth's mass decreases, effectively reducing escape velocity. This bandwagon effect applies generally to state changes, explaining why we observe quick transitions rather than gradual ones.

**Limitations of "first principles thinking"**: Reductionism holds that you can understand system by just understanding its constituent parts. But a complex system is often greater than the sum of its parts, exhibiting emergent behavior, so reductive thinking is inherently limited. Emergence is the opposite of reductionism. Multiple different fields have evolved to study phenomena from different perspectives. Each field has their scope and level of abstraction, suited to best study the phenomenons in their scope.

**Life and life-likeness**: Physics doesn't concern itself with defining life, but some life-like properties can be described in physical terms. For example, life tends to replicate itself, tends to require external energy and use it to repair itself. Considering some edge cases reveals how complex the barrier between life and not-life is:

 - Fire can self-replicate by spreading through a dry forest
 - Ice can repair itself if you make a hole in it and wait for the water to freeze

**Active and passive stability**: Consider the self repair of an ice sheet crushed by a stick and the self repair that happens when skin repairs a cut. These are very different processes; skin is capable of dynamic self-repair, but ice is passively self-repaired.

Life has a tendency to exist in states that require constant energy input just to remain alive; repair happens continuously in response to ongoing wear and tear. In the event of a cut, the same regular maintenance occurs but perhaps at an accelerated rate.

A frozen pond, in contrast, requires no continuous energy to remain frozen. The crystal structure of the ice is sufficiently stable that it can just continue to exist as long as the temperature doesn't increase. If the structure is disrupted, water under the ice will naturally return to the surface and spontaneously freeze because of the temperature of the surroundings, self-repairing spontaneously.

The downside of the frozen pond strategy is that ice's crystal structure is highly vulnerable to changes in the environment. When it gets warm, the crystal will reliably melt and turn into water. This is static stability.

A biological system, in contrast, typically has a broader operating range, and is more resilient to environmental variation. Life is complex and constantly requires external energy to survive, but it is far more resilient.

**Everything interesting flows**: is it true that all interesting systems require a constant flow of inbound energy? Equilibrium is death. There is a cascade of systems in which energy flows from one system to the next, with each of the energy flows cyclical in nature. These sub-systems are not in equilibrium, but they are still in predictable flow states. (There's an amazing visualization to be made on this theme, along the lines of [Powers of Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0))

**Resonance and adaptation**: Energy does not just come into a system in some random way. Instead, its flow and properties have a certain structure. For example, a singer can break a glass with her voice if her pitch matches the resonance frequency of the glass. The singer's voice can be represented as a spectrum of frequencies and powers. In this case, the singer modulates the frequency of the sound wave she emits until it matches that of the glass, and then cranks up the amplitude.

The singer's pitch is the source of energy for the singer-glass system. Unlike the singer-glass, most systems have a fixed source of energy, and entities in the system can adapt to it. In the singer-glass system, imagine an imaginary glass that changes size to match the resonance frequency of the singer's voice. Like the singer's voice, the sun's rays transmit electromagnetic energy in a particular spectrum of frequencies and powers. And like the glass, every living creature adapts to this structured energy to survive.

**Energy in the Goldilocks zone**: If energy is not structured correctly or is overpowering, it can be destructive to a system. England makes an interesting Goldilocks zone argument (see [[Goldilocks principle]]) inspired by the paradoxical story of Moses and the burning bush.

- A bush subject to no external driving force will die of neglect.
- A bush subject to too chaotic an external driving force will die of immolation.
- A bush needs to have structured external driving forces to thrive.

This is what inspired the name of the book. Every life is a bit on fire.


End of the World by Peter Zeihan
===
posted: Jan 18, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/end-of-the-world.jpg

Zeihan's book is an interesting exercise in scenario planning: what if America decides to step back from its role as policeman of the world? But this is not the framing that the author uses. Instead, the book is a high-confidence prediction about the future based on geopolitical and demographic trends. In short, America will step down as global hegemon, global trade will end, supply chains will be irreparably damaged, the world will turn multipolar, and everyone will starve to death, except the Americans who will be a-OK!

Zeihan is a consultant to large companies making important strategic decisions, so I guess high confidence comes with the territory. I would be surprised if Zeihan's world transpires fully, but he makes good "big history" points and the book was worthwhile if you can get past the bombastic vibes.

In general, Zeihan does a good job of going pretty deep into how the world works, and explaining things like I'm five. This is inevitably simplifying, as in his explanation of mediums of exchange, which ignore ledgers as an important part of the history (see [Debt by David Graeber](books/debt-the-first-5000-years/)). Nits aside, I really liked his concise chronicle of global mediums of exchange, all historically gold-backed currencies, all the way to the end of Bretton Woods, where the USD now floats freely, untethered to gold. There is a certain unevenness in the presentation however, for example I really disliked his convoluted explanation of inflation, disinflation, and deflation.

The book delves surprisingly deeply into many nitty-gritty side-spurs most of which I think serve to explain the complexity of the modern manufacturing.

**Geographies of Success**. At different stages of human civilization, different geographic features were desirable. For example:

- Hunter-gatherers geography of success: access to a variety of climactic zones, often best situated at the bases of mountains.
- Farmer geography of success: access to water, but also insulated from other people by large deserts.

Selon Zeihan, during the globalized American Order, these geographies ceased to matter, since you could get anything shipped to you. But once The Order collapses, they will begin to matter again.

**The Order and globalization**: After World War II, America was in a position to try to establish a Rome-like global empire. America weighed her options and decided that direct rule would be unsustainable. Instead, America wisely bought a period of peace by offering a militarily brokered economic order with prosperity for all. This meant an essentially global free trade network without any of the historical challenges and high costs. Previous trade networks had way more middle-men charging exuberant prices at every step of the way and way smaller shipping volumes. This ushered in an unprecedented peace dividend (see [[The peace dividend is over]]).

**Collapse of The Order**: When the Soviets emerged as a countervailing pole shortly after WW2, America's need to create a strong western alliance became even stronger. When the Soviet empire collapsed, and America "won" the Cold War, it lost its sense of urgency and direction. Zeihan claims that the order is over without much justification. It seems to be more of a mood affiliation (see [[The fallacy of mood affiliation]])

**The uneven spread of tech revolutions**: the industrial revolution began in Britain, where it took decades to refine the key inventions: steam engines, looms, factories. Subsequent adoption in other countries like Germany proceeded much faster. Later entrants like China industrialized even faster.

**Demographic determinism**: It's hard to refute demographics, which are definitely an underrated (by me) source of long-term future projection. Given a demographic pyramid of the current world, it's relatively easy to predict a future pyramid because of population dynamics. In general, the more affluent a country, the lower the birth rate. If you have few children today, you will likely have few children in twenty years, because fewer children today means fewer child-bearing adults.

One major flaw with demographic determinism is that there is more to the story than just age. For example, a large young population may be skilled or unskilled, and these scenarios will play out very differently.

Straightforward projection of demographics does not account for immigration. Countries like the US and Canada are based on an influx of people from the outside, and this remains a major advantage compared to many other countries, which have similarly low birth rates but no immigration.

**De-sourcing trend**: Multinational companies set up factories in other countries, hiring the local population and selling them the goods. Japan does this globally with Toyota and other car companies. China does this with their auto industry in Russia, especially after the pandemic (see [[Russian car industry after War on Ukraine]]). The US does this all over the world.

**The Order is fragile**. Zeihan points to a historical episode in the 1980s, where the Iraq-Iran war disrupted global trade because the insurance industry collapsed. This rhymes a lot with what's happening in the Red Sea and Yemen's Houthi trade route disruptions. Large container ships enable essentially free global shipping and a very complex supply chain for all things. Unfortunately they cannot be easily defended, and having military escorts for all of them would be very expensive. Zeihan calls them "floating buffets" for other countries to raid.

**Without The Order**: Zeihan's predictions without American-backed global free trade are dire.

- Unlike the Eurozone, Southeast Asia does not have an independently curated peace treaty, and many countries still harbor great hatreds towards one another from past aggression and atrocities (eg. most hate Japan, many fear China).
- Purely oil exporting countries which dominate the Middle East rely on everyone else for everything else.
- These Persian Gulf countries also rely on external experts for building and maintaining their own oil infrastructure, including both extraction and transportation.
- (Israel is half a world away, so if the American brokered global peace ends, it will be Israel against its genocidal Arab neighbors which outnumber it by orders of magnitude.)

**Split by hemisphere?** Zeihan predicts a multipolar world that is for some reason split by hemispheres. The American hemisphere will do super well for many reasons. First, there is so much untapped resource potential in America. Mexico has the right demographics and US has the right expertise to replace a lot of global supply chains. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will suffer because of longstanding hatreds, relative lack of resources.
