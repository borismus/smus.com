Secret of our Success by Joseph Henrich

cover: /assets/book-covers/soos.jpg

Humans are remarkably successful as a species. Why? Many would say it's because we're just so darn smart compared to other animals, but Henrich suggests that individual intelligence plays a small role. Our collective culture is what gives our species superpowers. Henrich's thesis is that human success is due to our adaptability, which we owe not to individual intelligence but due to collective culture built over generations. Culture is so central to our species that over a long enough time horizon, cultural evolution even feeds back into our genetic evolution.

I found this thesis appealing because it speaks to my inner communitarian and makes me feel better about not always being the sharpest tool in the shed. I also found a lot of great insights throughout the book, from new takes on ancient technology, to implications about artificial superintelligence. One recurring theme that fascinated me was ways in which "first principles thinking" can lead to pitfalls.

### European explorers don't often survive in foreign conditions without indigenous help
A great example where human culture trumps traditional intelligence for survival in the story of Franklin's disastrous 105-person expedition to King William island. The entire crew died in the freezing ice. Other explorer crews survived there before but only through their collaboration with indigenous locals. It was only through them, and not through first principles thinking that they could learn how to survive in such a challenging and unfamiliar environment. 

### Cultural and technological progress can be lost
Some civilizations have lost their ability to make fire. And in these cases what they do is they try to preserve a fire that's already burning for as long as possible. If it goes out because of a storm, they have to go to their neighbors in order to light it again. 

This seems like a cautionary tale that progress is far from guaranteed, and requires constant effort to maintain. Even technological progress is not necessarily an arrow (see [[Moral progress is a cycle, technological progress is an arrow]]).

### Human digestion coevolved with cooking
There is a feedback loop between human digestion and cooking. People evolved to rely on cooking to unlock more energy from the same sources of food. As a result, most of the human digestion organs have atrophied compared to other animals, except the small intestine which remains essential for extracting nutrients from the digested extracts, whether or not they have been processed by internal organs or the process of cooking.

As a result of this degenerative feedback loop, humans have smaller, weaker teeth and jaws and just generally require far less digestive instrumentation than their animal siblings. Gut tissue is really expensive to maintain compared to most other kinds of tissues in the human body. All of these savings could then be channeled into really big brains. 

### Brains require continuous energy → humans are fat
Unlike muscles or digestive tissue, the brain works full-time. There’s no resting at all, even at night. So it requires a source of base load energy, similar to the renewable energy challenge of producing electrical energy at night (see [[Whole Earth Discipline by Stewart Brand]]).

This explains why humans are so fat relative to other mammals: this fat can be metabolized as needed, to keep the brain going when there is not enough food around.

### We culturally evolved to run, efficiently cool, and carry water
(Maybe this is covered in Murakami's "Born To Run", but I never took detailed notes when I read it long ago.)

Henrich enumerates tons of adaptations for making humans superb long distance runners:

- Big gluteus maximus
- Springy arch in the foot
- Longer legs
- Tendency to slow twitch muscles
- Relative lack of hair
- Sweat glands
- Veins that cool the head

Shockingly, the main bottleneck for other mammals long distance running ability is thermal regulation. All mammals have a very narrow operating range 36-40C. Without human-grade cooling systems, other animals just can’t sustain long term exertion. They overheat. ^facc19

(Fascinating: I'm used to thermals being a limiting factor in electronics, and have never thought about it in a biological context. Also see [[Thermal limits are a fundamental constraint to biology and electronics]]) 

Humans are the sweatiest animal. A big part of the human cooling system relies on sweat. We can sweat 1-2 liters per hour while running. This is way more than most other animals. This is what enables humans to be such effective endurance hunters.

This is a great adaptation, but one problem with it is that we have very small amount of water storage. Donkeys can drink twenty liters of water in three minutes. Camels can drink a hundred liters of water at a time! Humans can drink at most two liters over ten minutes. This itself is not a pleasant experience, nor is the subsequent belly lurching run.

We might not be able to store much water internally, but we learned to carry water externally. Hands that initially evolved to climb trees became exapted for holding, crafting, and manipulating (see [[Examples of exaptation]]). We have hands that can carry, and brains that invented water containers and ways of finding water. Gourds, ostrich eggs, gazelle stomachs are all ancient non-obvious ways of carrying water. These all had to be discovered by a rare stroke of genius and culturally transfered from generation to generation. ("L'Dor V'Dor")

Other cultural techniques related to persistence hunting included:
 
- Knowledge of animal tracking to be able to determine where the animal went.
- Knowledge of animal gaits, which tend to be discrete (e.g. horses walk, trot, canter, and gallop) and map to natural paces. Equipped with this knowledge, human endurance hunters could force their prey into unnatural speeds to tire them out faster.
- Learning to find underground water via surface clues.

### Lactose persistence and co-evolution
Lactose persistence is another example of culture-gene coevolution. After domesticating livestock, humans began to rely on milk for sustenance, and many humans adopted tolerance to lactose. This has evolved very quickly for a biological scale, since we only domesticated animals about 12,000 years ago. 

### Ritualized cooking and the perils of first principles
Cassava is a key source of nutrition in the tropics, and the fourth staple crop globally (after corn, rice, wheat), but there's one problem: it's poisonous. Henrich dives deeply into the cultural evolution around the process of cassava preparation, making it safe to eat. The indigenous method for doing this is very elaborate; far more elaborate than just boiling.

Someone with a "first principles" mindset might just decide to make the process more efficient and forego the seemingly excessive parts of the complex indigenous ritual. Indeed, boiling improves the taste significantly. But it does not eliminate the cyanide that will damage the human nervous system. Perniciously, symptoms take years to develop, making for a highly unintuitive feedback loop. Relying on custom (read cultural evolution) in this case is the right move.

A corn-only diet is lacking in vitamin B3 and will cause pellagra over time. This explains some seemingly irrational traditions seen in Latin America, like adding ash to corn, or mixing it with seashell crunch. These interventions react and release the B3 from the corn.

[[First principles thinking sometimes fails]]

### Divination as a path to true randomness
Henrich offers a fascinating interpretation of divination as a way to enforce true randomness in a situation where human biases tend to certain fallacies. 

For example if a river just flooded people tend to think it won’t flood again for a while. This intuition is dead wrong. In fact the opposite. A river that recently flooded is likely to flood again — get out of the flood plane!

### High status can be achieved through dominance or prestige
Ever since reading [[Impro by Keith Johnstone]], I've been "status-pilled". "Impro" dives deeply into status in the context of improvisational theater.

Here Henrich describes two kinds of status: dominance and prestige. High status people come in at least two flavors: dominant and prestigious. Sometimes they overlap, often not.

Animals have a notion of status via the dominance hierarchy. Wolves, dogs, and other pack animals know this intuitively.

But humans culturally evolved a powerful new idea called prestige. This helps accelerate cultural learning because you identify people that are prestigious and focus attention on them. How do you know who is prestigious? 

1. Intrinsically: you find them effective, smart, etc. 
2. By social cues: other people find them worthy of emulation.

We tend to gravitate towards prestigious people. We curry favor with them. We emulate them.

| Dominance               | Prestige                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Act in overbearing ways | Self-deprecating             |
| Credit themselves       | Attributes success to others |
| Tease others            | Tell jokes                   |
| Manipulate              |                              |

Humans are adaptive cultural learners who adapt from others in their community. Use cues of prestige to pick who to learn from. Attend to particular domains in food sex danger and norm violations. 

But prestige is very malleable and culturally specific. In some context, great warriors are prestigious. In others, gentle nuns. In the late Roman Empire, St. Ambrose convinced rich Roman to give a lot of money to the poor as a sign of prestige. The saint gave away his wealth own wealth as a CRED.


### Prestige psychology can be weilded to change preferences: James Cook's scurvy story
People's preferences are not fixed. A well-designed program can move them in desirable ways.

Henrich retells a wild little story about captain James Cook and his solution to scurvy. By the time he was undertaking his voyage, Cook knew that to prevent curvy people needed vitamin C. Lemons would go bad at sea, but sauerkraut was preserved and so could last far longer, and had enough vitamin C. The problem was that sauerkraut was not very well-liked food. Cook knew that forcing his crew to eat it would cause resistance. Instead, he served it in the officers quarters. Then, when word came around to the rank-and-file that the officers were having sauerkraut, the men started to ask for it. This gave the meal prestige, everybody ate sauerkraut, got their daily dose of vitamin C, and nobody died of scurvy.

A similar thing happens at a smaller and less high-stakes scale. This is what acquired taste is all about: you imitate the tastes of those you perceive to be prestigious. 

(A modern and specific example of this is gamification. It is prestigious to be on top in a legible way, so scoreboards are a way to encourage people to participate in things they might normally not want to do. I've seen this in engineering teams, where people are awarded for fixing bugs in fixathons, or for dogfooding products.)

### Why animals and short-sighted modern humans don't care about their elders
Cultural learning involves learning from prestigious people. In a world that doesn't change very quickly, one life resembles the other from generation to generation. Thus there is massive value in learning from your elders, since they have experienced much of what you eventually will.

This is why age is often a good proxy for prestige. And also why wisdom is correlated to both. The reason people live long after reproductive age is to help spread cultural evolution to their children. This gives an evolutionary explanation for why humans live far beyond their reproductive age. And it seems to generalize across species: killer whales seem to have culture and menopause.

Animals that are biologically evolved to a particular niche do not need culture since they are pre-programmed by genetics to thrive in their niche. Thus animals mostly don't have cultural learning and so have no need to respect their elders. Few individuals survive into their post-reproductive years.

In a quickly changing world, it may be tempting to think that your life will be drastically different from the life of your parents. Thus the experience of our ancestors is no longer applicable. Is this why today it feels that fewer people tend to focus on respecting their elders?

My take is that although it appears on its face that our world is moving quickly, much of this change is happening at the highest pace layers. There are many ways in which life is not fundamentally different today compared to previous generations. Respect your elders! (See [[Moral progress is a cycle, technological progress is an arrow]])

### Asking the most junior opinion first improves our collective brain
Cultures invent epistemic hacks that tame status bias and let the group’s collective brain work. The Japanese tradition of letting the most junior speak gives them a voice and encourages independent thought. (see [[Japanese meetings ask junior people for input first]])

The same idea of letting the most junior speak first was also codified in capital cases in the Jewish Sanhedrin. To be extra sure every possible leniency is considered before executing someone, all voices of the court had to be heard, starting "from the side, where the least significant judges sit" (see [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.4.2?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en)).

The rule about most junior person speaking at first is apparently also held by the Canadian Supreme Court. But this rule does not hold up in the US Supreme Court. It certainly does not hold at Meta, nor did it really hold at Google.

### Marriage formalizes the pair bonding instinct
Most powerful social norms are aligned with innate psychology. For example, tolerance of foreigners is much harder to spread than maternal care. Other instincts include aversion to sibling incest and desire for pair bonding.

Most societies have reified the natural pair bonding instinct, but some societies did not. On one extreme, some societies have no notion of fatherhood, and children are conceived in secret visits by a man to a woman. Then the men of that society will contribute to the raising of their sister's children.

On the other shocking extreme, some societies believe that inseminating a woman only once is insufficient for a successful pregnancy, and that in fact you need multiple inseminations, ideally from multiple males. This leads to multiple men claiming fatherhood status over the progeny. This sounds insane but appears to work for societies where such norms have proven to be internally consistent. In such cases, studies show the best number of fathers to have is two.

In societies that allow polygyny (multiple wives for one husband) most prominent men tend to have more wives. Thus a large percentage of less successful men remain unmarried which increases conflict and has other negative effects. This is a sort of inequality that is resolved pretty easily by enforcing pair bonding norms. If you enforce monogamy, you also encourage more fathers, more men that are "domesticated", and a more harmonious civilization.

### How pair bonding evolved
Henrich describes how pair bonding may have evolved from the primate default: mothers alone are responsible for raising the next generation. Great apes never know who their father is, thus the adolescent males have no male model to emulate. Unless he had siblings from the same brood, the mother would be the only kin that he would know. Without pair bonding, male generation-to-generation cultural learning is stymied.

Concealed ovulation is another trick to encourage more pair bonding. If you don’t know when your partner is ovulating, the male is incentivized to be with her all the time, both to ensure that he is the rightful sire to any progeny, and to prevent any unwelcome approaches of other males. (See [[Menstrual vs estrous cycles]]).

### Meat taboos encouraged collective meal sharing
Many tribes have very specific meat taboos. Sometimes young men have to eat specifically the stomach lining and genitals of the game, while the hunter may only be given the ribs and the left shoulder, for example.

The meat taboos were enforced by people being told that disobeying them would lead to a bad hunt in the future. This was very effective in behavior change. Confirmation bias helped: if violation of the taboo did lead to a bad hunt the story would be remembered and retold. But otherwise the data point would be soon forgotten since nobody kept detailed records. 

### North America shows transitions from one dominant group to another
Henrich recounts the typical situation of one dominant group displacing and ultimately replacing another. The same thing happened even pre-European conquest in America. 

The Numic peoples, including Shoshone, Paiute, and Utes spread into the Great Basin (most of Nevada but also some Utah and California) around the 12th century, displacing [Fremont-style farmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_culture). Their edge came from hunting small game and foraging seeds, storing caches of nuts, knitting water-tight baskets, and being nomadic, and thus able to regroup fast when resources thinned.

After around 1700, European horses diffused into the Shoshone culture. A small breakaway group called the Comanche adopted horses fully and expanded dramatically. They pushed back the Spanish and the other Numic groups. The comanche dominated the continent until the United States came together and conquered the Comanche.

### In-lab behavior shows that people's pro-social preferences are biased by cultural norms
**The ultimatum game**: two participants. One is given the task of proposing how to split $100 between self and other. 

The other has the choice whether to reject or accept. If reject nobody gets anything. Otherwise people get paid the proposed amount. 

Rationally you should always accept for a nonzero amount. But the western adult norm is 50-50.

Another lab game is **the free rider game**. A group of people has to decide how much to give to a pot which is divided evenly. The pot initially has 4 per person and people can give up to 4 dollars. 

The “rational” solution is to give nothing and be a free rider.

Internalized social norms help people easily navigate social environments. Helps them comply with local normals without much thinking. 

**Public goods game**: group does best if everyone cooperates but individual does best if everyone ELSE cooperates.

Group of 4 in a single interaction. Each person is given 4 dollars. Whatever enters the project is doubled and equally distributed.

If all contribute, 16 in the pot is doubled to 32, then split four ways. They all come back with $8.

Otherwise, if one person doesn’t contribute while the rest do, the pot of \$12 doubles to \$24, split four ways. This gives the defector 6$ plus his original 4$, $2 more than his conformist outcome. Thus there is an incentive to defect. 

And yet, people do tend to add something into the pot.

### Simple agent-based simulations suggest being dumb but social is far better than being a smart loner
Very clear example of **genius vs butterfly**: two groups are very different. Describes an agent based simulation. 

Geniuses are 100x more likely to invent something. Butterfly are 10x more interconnected.  By being connected to someone that invents something you have some chance of learning it. 

Imagine this for one invention. Over time the invention will either be invented by the individual or passed on to them. 

But the butterfly group is far faster at this diffusion process. So it pays to be social rather than smart

Also having a **large group is better than a small one** because it increases the size of the collective brain. This is why cities are so powerful: many people, densely interconnected.

Also see this [Genius-butterfly simulation](https://claude.ai/chat/1684f614-de53-4d39-84a3-a6f81de9b7a8?artifactId=genius-butterfly-simulation) (thx claude).

### Sign language and whistle languages as cultural adaptation
I had no idea that there were sign languages in indigenous North American culture. Apparently, Plains Indian Sign Language ([PISL]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indian_Sign_Language)) was a sort of lingua franca for many tribes that did not share a spoken tongue. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1-StAlw3aE)

Whistle languages are expressive and used by mountainous tribes, where multiple adjacent villages are close in distance as the crow flies but good but take a long time to get from one to the other because of the challenging terrain. Especially in [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_bird_language), confusingly called "Turkish bird languages". [Written in the Wind](https://www.francescaphillips.com/written-in-the-wind/) is a film about the whistle languages spoken (whistled?) on the Canary Islands.

### Sonority and color in language-culture
Fascinatingly, language sonority (depth and fullness) basically varies with the temperature of the areas in which the language is spoken. The warmer the climate, the more sonorous the tone of the language. Henrich explains that this is because in warmer climates, more of the conversations happen outdoors, so acoustics are worse, and higher sonority means that others can hear you better. In cold countries where people spend more time indoors, it's easier to hear people are more prone to mumbling. This eventually gets culturally encoded in the way the language is spoken.

In some primitive languages, there are only words for light and dark. If you have three color words, you typically have white, black, and red. At the next level of complexity is white, black, red, blue, green, and yellow. Henrich claims that black, white and red are the only colors mentioned in a bunch of Greek literature. That seems specious to me — doesn't Homer famously describe the sunrise as a "rosy-fingered Dawn" and "Dawn on her golden throne"? (see [The Odyssey transated by Emily Wilson](/books/the-odyssey-translated-by-emily-wilson-audio/))

### Fine motor skills are required for both speech and complex tool use, and may be linked in an amplifying feedback loop
Henrich opened my mind to the connection between spoken language and dexterity: fine motor skills. Whether it is fine motor control of your digits or your tongue, the same part of the brain is responsible for the human level of control required. Language and tool use seems to be common across the cerebellum and the motor cortex brain regions. **FOXP2** on Chromosome 7 might be the genetic ticket to making this happen.

It's unclear how the arrow of causality flies. Did humans first learn to speak, enhancing their motor control abilities which led them to increased dexterity, or was it the other way around? Language was probably not the main cause of cultural evolution, but probably accelerated it. Whatever the origins, there is a clear feedback loop between dexterity, speech, and the fine motor control centers of the brain.

You can see it is interrelated anecdotally. When performing fine finger motions  or learning a dance move people often stick out their tongue.

(Aside: totally surprising that the same area of one's brain that is responsible for a face recognition is also used in helping to read. The brain does letter boxing where uppercase 'R' and lowercase 'r', trigger the same area of the brain despite being completely different symbols.)

### Culture affects biology in the short term and genetics in the long term
SooS reified an important distinction between biology and genetics. Culture can certainly affect your biology IN THE SAME GENERATION. Different cultures are truly different, and emphasize different things. This results in significant biological differences. Some are more fit, others are more intelligent, others are more musical.

Fascinating and starkly put: you cannot infer a species' level of intellect based on its tools. This is all downstream of their social complexity. One of the main pieces of this book is that **cultural evolution can do what genetic evolution can do, except faster, and without speciation**.

### Example of culture → biology: traditional beliefs affecting lifespan
Heinrich offers a fascinating study about Chinese Americans and their horoscope induced beliefs. In traditional Chinese culture you can be born in one of five elements: metal, water, wood, fire, and earth. Each of these is associated with a particular part of the body (from [[Chinese horoscope and calendar is actually a sixty year system]]):

| Element | Birth year ending in | Body part |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Metal   | 0 or 1               | Lung      |
| Water   | 2 or 3               | Kidney    |
| Wood    | 4 or 5               | Liver     |
| Fire    | 6 or 7               | Heart     |
| Earth   | 8 or 9               | Pancreas  |

The study looked at the correlation of diseases that cause symptoms to these parts of the body for people that were born under the corresponding element. The control group were non-traditional Chinese Americans that didn't even knew about this system. The study showed that believing in the system took five years off of their life on average.

### Two big feedback loops: generational and genetic
One powerful idea from SooS is that there are two cultural feedback loops operating at vastly different timescales:

1. **Culture → biology**: Culture which is passed from generation to generation and from one individual to the next. This is a relatively fast loop and is not especially durable. Successful transfer is not guaranteed, and knowhow can easily be lost.
	- For example, your father may teach you how to create a bow and arrow, and you can pass that knowledge onto your children and others of the same tribe.
2. **Culture → genetics**: And then there is a much much longer loop where culture affects the DNA. This happens over many many generations, in which a natural selection process occurs across populations where all groups are selected for being good at certain cultural practices.
	- For example, your ancestral line got really good at bow making, which turned out to be a significant advantage. People that had more dexterous hands were better bowyers. Better bows meant people could more effectively hunt prey, provide for their families, and ensure their offspring survival. Bow making depends on having extremely dexterous fingers, which also required the evolution of finegrained neural control (e.g. FOXP2?)


### Hominids took a while to start the cultural learning flywheel because of the cold start problem
Why is it the case that only humans (and very few other animals) have adopted cultural learning? Henrich describes this as "Crossing the Rubicon", and it sounds like it was a pretty rough crossing.

Firstly, it probably took a while. And gains can easily be offset by losses. Many civilizations lost the ability to create fire (see [[Cultural and technological progress can be lost]]).

Henrich suggests that there's a cold start problem here. For cultural learning to happen, there needs to be culture that is worth adopting. If there is nothing to learn, why bother? You can rely on yourself and just start from first principles instead. And so it took a while to build up this initial corpus of useful culture to kick off the virtuous feedback loops.

### Human cultures are diverse and hard to design; let a thousand flowers bloom
Different societies vary in their social norms, institutions, languages and technologies. They have different heuristics, way of thinking, and emotional reactions to the same events. Imposition of imported institutions is often unsuccessful.

Henrich takes a libertarian approach to this. Humans suck at designing effective institutions so let a thousand institutions bloom. At a meta-level, we should design a variation-and-selection system that allow alternative institutions to be tried. 

(Although he never calls it out, I was reminded of the promise of charter schools and more speculatively, charter cities.)

### Understanding that traditions are a result of cultural evolution is an infohazard
Most individuals are deeply ingrained into a culture. We do not understand how much of us is a product of their environment. Reminds me of [[I am I in my circumstances (Ortega)]] and the famous DFW essay "This is Water".

Most members of traditional societies, when asked for the reason they respect a taboo or practice a ritual, answer "because this is how it is done". At scale, ignorance of the deeper reason for their practice may be a self-preserving feature.

Modernity makes people see their traditional background from the outside. They begin think from first principles whether they want it in their life. Many balk at the primitive and superstitious ways of their ancestors and abandon their ancestral traditions. But doing this wholesale they may be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. By discarding tradition, we drop constraints but also lose the benefits associated with them. (See [[Infohazards - some true information can harm]]).


Math from Three to Seven by A. K. Zvonkin
===
rating: yes
posted: Jun 8, 2025
cover: /assets/book-covers/math-three-to-seven.jpg

More a journal than an educational treatise, Math from Three to Seven chronicles the uniquely soviet phenomenon known as Математические Кружки (Math Circles), applied specifically to young kids. I personally experienced a version of this growing up in Vancouver courtesy of my parent's Компания (a tight-knit friend-group) where various uncles and aunts DP, AL, GJ, YX, MS, and others took to supplementing the education of the next generation. DP led the math circle, and I, having had the least soviet schooling, really struggled compared to my peers. It was revealing and humbling and formative. DP's circle was more formal and rigorous since we were older, but Zvonkin's circles remind me a lot of that experience.

Reflecting on the concept of Subject Circles, it strikes me as a rare and great example of civic society in Russian culture. In fact, these band-scale groups of ~10 families are very strong in Russian culture. Could it be that civic society there is set up for much smaller groups than in the west?

Ok philosophical musings aside, this book is quite tactical and stays close to the straight and narrow. Most of his energies are spent on chronicling his successes and failures teaching mathematics to groups of young children, with an emphasis not on getting to the answer, but on asking interesting questions:

> It is not the puzzles, nor their solutions, that are interesting, but the process, the path that connects them. [...] What is the point of my lessons? It’s fun to ask questions and look for answers. It’s a way of life.

Rarely does Zvonkin digress into philosophy or development psychology, and when he does he cites awesome stuff, some of which is heartwarmingly familiar, such as [Mindstorms by Seymour Papert](/books/mindstorms-by-seymour-papert/). Like language, mathematics is acquired naturally, not through rigorous and systematic approaches.

> The best way to learn french is to grow up in France. The best way to learn math is to grow up in Mathland. - Seymour Papert

My main takeaway from the book is a list of inspiring “problems” to show my own kids aged four and seven, to cultivate their mathematical curiosity.
### Problems to cultivate curiosity

Explore a **Möbius strip**. Make one regular ring, and one as a Möbius strip. See how drawing a line down the middle works in both cases. See what cutting down that line does in both cases.

Draw and define **quadrilaterals** and sneak in some basic set ideas. Maybe a Venn diagram too. Explain squares, rectangles, trapezoids, parallelograms. How many of which are there? What can we say about rules here?

Talk about fantastical situations and discuss **transitivity**. For example imagine an ant is bigger than a dog and a dog is bigger than an elephant. Then what do we know about ants and elephants? This relies on Smedslund's work on idea conflict: when individuals encounter contradictory ideas, particularly in social contexts, they are more likely to engage in reflection and actively seek to resolve the conflict, leading to cognitive growth.

**Partial ordering** of clothes. In what order do you put on clothes? What order do you take them off? Note you can put on your hat first, or your socks first, but there are dependencies when it comes to shoes.

In the same vein as clothes, a structure made out of blocks also has a partial ordering. Can kids create a dependency graph for constructing the structure? I found this PERT graph idea really neat:

![PERT Graph from toy towers](/assets/book-reviews/pert.jpg)

**Five choose two**: Zvonkin spent quite a bit of time with his circles trying to approach the same combinatoric problem from many different perspectives, all isomorphic to one another. But let the kids figure out that all of these problems are the same organically.
1. Color in chains of length five made out of red and blue links. How many chains are there?
2. Get five bins and two balls. How many ways are there to place the balls in these bins?
3. How many paths are there from one corner of a 5x2 rectangle to the other? Do this on graph paper. Encode each path as a sequence of Right (R) and Up (U) steps.

**Rectangle counting**: how many rectangles are there in a rectangle with a split in the middle? In a grid of 2x2 squares.

**Frequency analysis** for which sum of two dice rolls is the most common?  Try it out. Make a table ourselves, then count how frequent each roll is. See if we can make bets!

**Prime numbers** through geometry. Try to make a rectangle out of N cubes. Can you do it with 9? Can you do it with 12? In how many ways? Try with 19. Do it systematically for all numbers up to say 28, making a table of primes and composites.

**Patronymics** is a fun puzzle. But less relevant in an Anglo setting. Still a cool formula: write out an empty family tree and then provide a set of names and patronyms. Arrange the people into the family tree.

**Graph paper** games for nerds. I draw something on a graph paper, and then get the kids copy it. Then have them rotate it by 90 degrees. Flip it. Scale it up. In another variant, I draw a pattern on a graph paper and get the kids to continue the pattern.

[Three utilities problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_utilities_problem): A little bit of graph theory with 3 houses and 3 wells. Can you make a path from each house to each well without having any paths cross?

**Homeomorphic letters**: imagine letters made out of bendable wire which can be compressed squished etc. Classify them into categories of homeomorphisms. Here's [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3364) with more detail.

**Gauss Summation**: see if I can tease the idea for getting a closed form solution for adding the first N numbers! This is a problem that Gauss solved as a child with the doubling backwards trick. What a great clean proof, still can't get over it decades later.

**Draw water levels**: Try the water level game with Eliana and Zyam. See if they can draw the water line on a drawing of a tilted water bottle.

A while ago I began wondering where all the optimistic leftwing voices went. The rest of the camps, I thought, were well represented:

|             | Left                            | Right                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Optimistic  | ***??***                        | "To the moon!!!"                |
| Pessimistic | Climate doomers<br>de-growthers | Automation and fear of job loss |


Ezra Klein & Derek Thompson attempt to define the left-optimistic camp. Abundance is a rallying cry which provides a positive vision of what the world should be like. This is rare and difficult to pull off. It's much easier to diagnose problems than provide solutions.

Abundance is a good summary of reform minded, technocratic liberal policies from folks like Matt Yglesias and Saul Griffith. I especially liked the section on state capacity and why it has been hampered in the US. The environmental movement enabled modern lawfare, and the judicial system governs everything around me.

Most importantly, this book is important because it is popular. Its prominent display on airport bookshelves is an early symptom of a much-needed democratic reckoning. It is a tacit acceptance of the excesses of progressivism and Democratic policy failures.

I already knew that [solar got cheap faster than even solar advocates thought](https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/). I knew that US zoning laws were problematic and [Japan had way better ones](http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html)), and about the [power of cities](https://smus.com/books/scale-by-geoffrey-west/). Likewise, I'd heard about the possible deceleration of scientific discovery, and the pain and expense of academic grant writing. This book synthesizes these things and far more. My notes on the most interesting and new-to-me bits:

## State capacity over size
Ultimately, the government should neither be big nor small. Instead, it should strive to increase its state capacity. It should be in the business of being a bottleneck remover. An effective example is one that compares two contrasting visions: one a conservative utopia in which oil and gas pipelines crisscross the country and highways are wide and well maintained. The other in which solar panels cover everything and combined with nuclear plants and wind turbines provide all of our abundant energy. Both of these visions require the government to have an ability to build. For more on state capacity I really enjoyed a paper called [States and Economic Growth by Johnson and Koyama](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014498316301966).

## US zoning laws proliferated very quickly
In 1900 no US cities had zoning laws. By 1930 70% of them did. Zoning laws began as a pragmatic split between residential and industrial zones but soon became specific and prescriptive, imposing rules about what sorts of residential housing was appropriate for different parts of the residential zone. Another example of one of my favorite lenses [[Two Watersheds — excess institutionalization is bad]].

## Lawfare was amplified by the Environmental movement
Lawfare, "democracy by lawsuit", was begun by the environmentalist movement arguably from the roots of Carson's Silent Spring and weaponized by associations with high Asabiyyah such as the environmental organizations. Organizations like the Sierra Club learned to lobby the government on behalf of the environment, and if needed, pursued sued the government. Ralph Nader and his raiders viewed government as a force to be stopped rather than helped and opened more holes through which they could legally attack the government and win. This in turn led to a government on its back foot, defensively introducing more and more regulation.

## The legal system in central to the US bureaucracy
In many countries policy is decided by bureaucrats (think EU), in America it is effectively decided by the judicial system, since all law will quickly go through the legal gauntlet.

> No individual law will address this many individual blockages at so many individual points in the system. What is needed here is a change in political culture, not just a change in legislation. **Liberalism acted, across many levels and branches of government in the 1970s, to slow the system down so that the instances of abuse could be seen and could be stopped. Now, we need to act across many levels and branches of government to speed the system up.

Adversarial legalism in the US is not new. Tocqueville write about it. And America has 4x as many lawyers as in Germany and 2x as France (per capita). This is in part because of the American distrust of government, which leads to more lawsuits of the government for various reasons. [[Subsystems that integrate conflict can lead to more resilience]].

## Trade-off denial vs climate denial
A good lens new to me: the capitalist right suffers from "climate denial", questioning whether human caused change is real. But the environmental left suffers from "trade off denial", where they don't see that their environmental regulation have tradeoffs.

## Favor pull over push policies

- Pull policies encourage behavior in the market. For example, you can setup bounties for corporations to reach certain outcomes. The government can create subsidies for companies exhibiting certain desirable behaviors, or working in some industries.
- Push policies involve a bidding process in which multiple companies compete for a government contract. This is often a protracted up-front process with strong whiffs of nepotism, which leads to situations where you have a small select of gigantic favored contractors, like Primes in the military contracting world.
- Operation Warp Speed (OWS) was successful because it reduced barriers and created subsidies for COVID vaccines, but didn’t have a bidding process or exclusive deals with a specific company. This increased the competitiveness of the process and reduced slowdowns.

One evening I was listening to Abundance in San Francisco, walking towards a bar to meet up with some FLUX'ers. I passed Chinatown's iconic lanterns and crossed Grant street just as  I heard a page out of a vignette about Katalin Karikó: "Every night it would be grant grant grant. The answer would be no no no.". This coincidence made me so happy, as if a divine being was beside me, manufacturing serendipity.

Abundance does a great job of synthesizing myriads of observations and policies in a neat little package. Most importantly, it makes these wonky ideas accessible and addressable under one memorable word: Abundance. In these times of pith, "a liberalism that builds" feels sufficiently meme-like to change the discourse. One can hope?


VALIS by Phillip K. Dick
===
rating: yes
posted: April 9, 2025
cover: /assets/book-covers/valis.jpg

VALIS stands for _Vast Active Living Intelligence System_, a critical piece in Horselover Fat's vision of God. This revelation comes at a turbulent time in Fat's life, shortly after his wife's suicide and the subsequent suicide of multiple girlfriends in the Bay Area of the 1960s.

> No one could discern how much was due to drugs. This time in America—1960 to 1970—and this place, the Bay Area of Northern California, was totally fucked.

This is not a plot driven book, but just as a reminder to myself, here it is.

Fat, completely obsessed with his religious experience, sets out to document it in his Exegesis and shares it with a small group of friends, including Philip K. Dick, who turns out to be Fat himself — in a schizophrenic way. Another of Fat's friends Kevin introduces Fat to a film called Valis which contains obvious references to events and prophecies identical to those that in Horselover Fat's revelations. This is intriguing to Fat/Phil, Kevin and their other friend David, and they all seek out the films makers. One of them turns out to be Eric Lampton, who appears to be some superposition of David Bowie and Eric Clapton. Through Eric and his wife, the friends, now calling themselves the Rhipidon Society ("fish cannot carry guns"), meet their daughter. She is a two-year-old girl named Sophia who is the incarnation of the Messiah, as prophesized. She cures Phil's schizophrenic personality split, confirms VALIS' existence and preaches that we should worship humanity, not gods. She dies days later in an unfortunate accident, which Phil forsees in a dream. This shock which eventually brings Fat back into existence and sends him on a global quest to find the next Messiah.

This was not an easy book to get through but I found it theologically intriguing.

# Deep references everywhere
VALIS features a wild mishmash of cultural references, from highbrow to lowbrow and back. I was familiar with most, but post-VALIS they will be tinged with a psychotic valence when I revisit them. Time to listen.

- "Tis this that racks my brain, And pours into my breast a thousand pangs, That lash me into madness..." from an aria in **Handel's Messiah**. "Fat and I used to listen to my Seraphim LP of Richard Lewis singing it"
- **“Total Eclipse” from Handel’s “Samson”**
- “My favorite Dead album is **Workingman’s Dead**,” Gloria said at one point.
- "Remind him of the night he and Bob had seen **the movie Patton** before attending Gloria’s graveside service"
- Fat could not write poetry worth shit, despite his best efforts. He loved **Wordsworth’s “Ode,”** and wished he could come up with its equal. He never did
- “You see, son, here time becomes space.” **Wagner, Parsifal**, Act 1 (1882).  (Surprisingly, Parsifal seems to have been [banned in Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal#Racism_debate))
- (VALIS was also turned into an Opera by MIT Media Lab's Tod Machover, [re-produced in 2023](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/valis-an-opera-by-tod-machover/))

I loved PKD's linguistic play, for example:

- Take this English instance: GOD IS NO WHERE / GOD IS NOW HERE, which is pretty relevant because of the all-caps, no-spaces style of [[Carolingian minuscule]] in the [[High Middle Ages]].
- The main protagonist is Horselover Fat, a schizophrenic persona of PKD. Philip in Greek means "fond of horses"; dick is German for "fat".


# On Parsifal and confusion
Dick writes:

> Parsifal is one of those corkscrew artifacts of culture in which you get the subjective sense that you’ve learned something from it, something valuable or even priceless; but on closer inspection you suddenly begin to scratch your head and say, “Wait a minute. This makes no sense.” I can see Richard Wagner standing at the gates of heaven. “You have to let me in,” he says. “I wrote Parsifal. It has to do with the Grail, Christ, suffering, pity and healing. Right?” And they answer, “Well, we read it and it makes no sense.” SLAM. Wagner is right and so are they.

VALIS belongs in the same bucket of "corkscrew artifacts of culture". I can see Philip K. Dick standing at the same gates.

# Maurice and Fat's parallel versions of religion
Fat's therapist is Maurice, a former IDF paratrooper with bulging muscles. He is hilariously depicted in a series of theological dialogs exhibiting their two very different takes on God. Maurice's straightforward and pragmatic, PKD's esoteric and hand-ringingly intellectual:

> Staring at him, Maurice said, “Who made up this stuff? You?”
>
> “Basically,” Fat said, “my doctrine is Valentinian, second century C.E.”
>
> “What’s ‘C.E.’?” “Common Era. The designation replaces A.D. Valentinus’s Gnosticism is the more subtle branch as opposed to the Iranian, which of course was strongly influenced by Zoroastrianism dualism. Valentinus perceived the ontological salvific value of the gnosis, since it reversed the original, primal condition of ignorance, which represents the state of the fall, the impairment of the Godhead which resulted in the botched creation of the phenomenal or material world.

Maurice reminds Fat of the scriptures, but Fat brings in his own Gnostic takes. It's pretty funny.

> Let me tell you what it says in _Genesis_, in case you've forgotten. Then God said, Let us make man in our image and likeness to rule the fish in the sea, the birds of heaven, the cattle, all--”
>
> “Okay,” Fat breaks in, “but that's the creator deity, not the true God.”
>
>“What?” Maurice says.
>
> Fat says, “That's Yaldaboath. Sometimes called Samael, the blind God. He's deranged.”
>
> “What the hell are you talking about?” Maurice said.
>
> “Yaldaboath is a monster spawned by Sophia who fell from the Pleroma...”

And my favorite exchange:

> “Let me just say one thing,” Fat said.
>
> Irritably, Maurice nodded.
>
> “The creator deity,” Fat said, “may be insane and therefore the universe is insane. What we experience as chaos is actually irrationality. There is a difference.”
>
> He was silent, then. “The universe is what you make of it,” Maurice said. “It’s what you do with it that counts. It’s your responsibility to do something life-promoting with it, not life-destructive.”
>
> “That’s the existential position,” Fat said. “Based on the concept that We are what we do, rather than, We are what we think. It finds its first expression in Goethe’s Faust, Part One, where Faust says, ‘Im Anfang war das Wort.’ He’s quoting the opening of the Fourth Gospel; ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ Faust says, ‘Nein, Im Anfang war die Tat.’ ‘In the beginning was the deed.’ From this, all existentialism comes.” Maurice stared at him as if he were a bug.

# The Exegesis
PKD began a journal capturing his visionary experiences in 1974, which I would guess served as the basis for many of his works, certainly including VALIS. Interestingly, twenty years after publishing VALIS, fragments of this journal were compiled into [his Exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exegesis_of_Philip_K._Dick). This book may have helped PKD get some of these ideas into the world in a less serious way.

Horselover Fat (aka PKD) experienced divine revelation. Sites of his brain were being selectively stimulated by tight energy beams emanating from far off, perhaps millions of miles away. He was in fact seeing and hearing words, pictures, figures of people, printed pages, in short God and God’s Message, or, as Fat liked to call it, the Logos.

Much of the references found in the Exegesis is well beyond my ken, referencing Gnostic ideas and works such as [On the Origin of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_the_World), featuring obscure personae like the fallen archangel Samael, and Pistis Sophia, a figure representing "Wisdom in Faith":

> He said, ‘I am god and no other one exists except me.’ But when he said these things, he sinned against all of the immortal (imperishable) ones, and they protected him. Moreover, when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler, she was angry. Without being seen, she said, ‘You err, Samael,’ i.e., ‘the blind god.’ ‘An enlightened, immortal man exists before you. This will appear within your molded bodies. He will trample upon you like potter’s clay, (which) is trampled. And you will go with those who are yours down to your mother, the abyss.’

Horselover Fat's Gnostic speculations remind me of [John Dee and the Empire of Angels](/books/john-dee-and-the-empire-of-angels-by-jason-louv/), and his exegesis closely mirrors Dee's and Kelly's scrying sessions.

# An Irrational God?
Since the universe appears to be irrational, and created in God's image, it must be the case that God is irrational:

> Fat believed that a streak of the irrational permeated the entire universe, all the way up to God or the Ultimate Mind, which lay behind it. [...] In other words, the universe itself—and the Mind behind it—is insane. Therefore, someone in touch with reality is, by definition, in touch with the insane: infused by the irrational.

When Fat is admitted into a mental asylum, Dr. Stone sees him and understands him and appears versed in the same Gnostic tradition. He guides Fat to seek a higher god, above the veneer of irrationality:

> The answer to Fat’s question, “Is the universe irrational, and is it irrational because an irrational mind governs it?” receives this answer, via Dr. Stone: “Yes it is, the universe is irrational; the mind governing it is irrational; but above them lies another God, the true God, and he is not irrational; in addition that true God has outwitted the powers of this world, ventured here to help us, and we know him as the Logos,”

> "The mentally disturbed do not employ the Principle of Scientific Parsimony: the most simple theory to explain a given set of facts. They shoot for the baroque." — PKD, VALIS

# Time and remembering the past and future
PKD continuously explores the subject of the fungibility of time, and whether you can "remember future lives":

> Siddhartha, the Buddha, remembered all his past lives; this is why he was given the title of buddha which means “the Enlightened One.” [...] Empedocles, too, like the Buddha and Pythagoras, could remember his past lives. What they did not talk about was their ability to “remember” future lives.

Can you have a collective memory?

> Phylogenic memory, memory of the species. Not my own memory, ontogenic memory. “Phylogeny is recapitulated in ontogeny,” as it is put. The individual contains the history of his entire race, back to its origins. Back to ancient Rome, to Minos at Crete, back to the stars.

PKD elaborates on the concept of the abolition of time, described as a "loss of amnesia" with ample references and impressive erudition:

> The great mystery of Eleusis, of the Orphies, of the early Christians, of Sarapis, of the Greco-Roman mystery religions, of Hermes Trismegistos, of the Renaissance Hermetic alchemists, of the Rose Cross Brotherhood, of Apollonius of Tyana, of Simon Magus, of Asklepios, of Paracelsus, of Bruno, consists of the abolition of time. The techniques are there. Dante discusses them in the Comedy. It has to do with the loss of amnesia; when forgetfulness is lost, true memory spreads out backward and forward, into the past and into the future, and also, oddly, into alternate universes; it is orthogonal as well as linear.

All of this time business reminds me of the idea of a sacred time in [[The Sabbath by Heschel]].

# Multiple entities fill the same niche over time

[Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth](/books/mystery-teachings-by-j-m-greer/) introduced me to this idea of filling a placeholder, where the organism may die, but another will take its place:

> **Placeholders in ecosystems**: I found powerful the idea that individuals in an ecosystem can be seen as fitting into a placeholder. The organism may die, but its immediate life wasn't that important for the whole system. The individual was playing a role that many had played in the past, and many will play in the future.

Greer provides examples of this niche that is filled by a sequence of organisms. This is echoed by PKD in a little vignette of a playing cat:

> Somewhere, Schopenhauer says that the cat which you see playing in the yard is the cat which played three hundred years ago.

PKD speculates wildly that the same soul is transferring through multiple bodies.

> We are talking about Christ. He is an extra-terrestrial life form which came to this planet thousands of years ago, and, as living information, passed into the brains of human beings already living here, the native population. We are talking about interspecies symbiosis. Before being Christ he was Elijah. The Jews know all about Elijah and his immortality—and his ability to extend immortality to others by “dividing up his spirit.” The Qumran people knew this. They sought to receive part of Elijah’s spirit. “You see, my son, here time changes into space.”

This can also apply to empires. Dick's refrain "the empire never ended" is a core part of PKD's gnostic worldview and points to the notion that the oppressive power structures of ancient Rome—or “the Empire”—persist throughout time, concealed behind ever-shifting forms of government, technology, and society:

> ...During the interval in which he had experienced the two-world superimposition, he had seen not only California, USA, of the year 1974 but also ancient Rome, he had discerned within the superimposition a Gestalt shared by both space-time continua, their common element: a Black Iron Prison. This is what the dream referred to as “the Empire.” He knew it because, upon seeing the Black Iron Prison, he had recognized it. Everyone dwelt in it without realizing it. The Black Iron Prison was their world.


The Maniac by Benjamín Labatut

I recently watched a movie called "The Bit Player" bankrolled by IEEE, about Claude Shannon and his contributions. The film was informative something was a bit off. In what could be described as a fauxcumentary or docudrama, Shannon was portrayed relatively convincingly by an actor, but rather than creating a narrative arc of his life and work, this fake Shannon was portrayed in a sequence of reenacted interviews. Some of them were informative and entertaining, others cringeworthy and irrelevant, almost bordering on mockumentary.

Upon reflection, I found "The Maniac" a little bit like "The Bit Player", which surprised me since like its [[When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut|predecessor]] it straddles this same fact-and-fiction line. Either under the influence of the Shannon documentary or because it is simply worse I enjoyed this book far less. Another contributing factor was perhaps that I listened to it as an audiobook and the narration, especially the female narrator who played Von Neumann's wife and daughter had a distracting accent, serving only to fortify the idea I just couldn't shake that these historical figures were just pantomiming actors.

---

**Parallels to the 1920s**: The anxious, tumultuous interwar vibe of the 1920s (“we knew that the wonderful world that was built for us was coming to an end”) reminded me of present-day feelings of precariousness. Both eras are shaped by major innovations (whether quantum theory or AI) combined with rapid political shifts to produce a collective sense of uneasy acceleration.

**Von Neumann’s Intellectual Legacy** touched many pivotal 20th-century developments: designing the first fully programmable computer (the “MANIAC”), formulating the principle of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), and conceiving of self-replicating machines well before the structure of DNA was even understood, as well as “von Neumann probes”, self-replicating spacecraft that could travel to the far reaches of the galaxy. This was simply interesting.

**His frenetic personal life** is a stark contrast with his boundless intellectual curiosity and comedic playfulness. The most disturbing were his late-in-life dabbling with religion: frenetic forays into his native Judaism, and a last-ditch conversion to Catholicism.

**Computing and the Hydrogen Bomb** the development of the hydrogen bomb required massive computational power. Human “calculators” could no longer handle the complexity; thus, machines like the MANIAC were indispensable. This foreshadows how computing became the central engine driving modern science and technology. [[Getting to many destinations requires tacking (zig-zagging)]]

**Creativity, Play, and AI** John von Neumann and Richard Feynman valued playfulness and curiosity in serious scientific inquiry. That said Labatut also did a good job of showing the perils of excessive playfulness: a certain nihilism and psychopathology. AI has taken a narrow path to mastery (AlphaZero’s pure self-play in Go), but still lacks the open-ended, playful immersion children show when learning. Can advanced AI develop a truly exploratory, flexible sense of “play” in the real world, rather than in highly constrained settings like Chess, Go? LLM advances for "play" in LLMs is very impressive, but the real world is more complex still. See [[Physical and embodied intelligence]].

**AI’s Impact on “Art”** is so far quite destructive. Lee Sedol lamented that Go used to be an art form but has changed now that AI dominates the game. A similar thing is happening with "Ghiblification", in which a beloved aesthetic that once took years of human effort can be conjured in seconds. This touches on a broader debate: Does AI’s involvement in creative or aesthetic fields reduce them to mechanical processes, or does it expand the boundaries of creativity?

**Extended Phenotype and Technology**: A spider’s web or a beaver’s dam are examples of the extended phenotype of their respective creators. Can we view technology as extended phenotype of the human? See [[Extended phenotype — technology as human secretion]].

**The Legends of Go** are really awesome. This was probably my favorite part of the book. Labatut evocatively describes the legendary Emperor Yao who invented the game of Go to challenge his wayward, evil son Danzhu. The victor would rule the universe. It seems like Labatut greatly embellishes the traditional tale, but it's worth it. Another memorable Go story retold in the second part of the book was that of the blood-vomiting game of 1835 which lasted four consecutive days after which the loser Akaboshi coughed or vomited blood all over the board, dying within a few months.


A Peace to End All Peace by David Fromkin
===
rating: yes
posted: Feb 24, 2025
cover: /assets/book-covers/peace-to-end-all-peace.jpg

Worth it for the name alone, this is a comprehensive presentation of what happened when the sick man of Europe finally died. It gives excellent background on the complexity of the Ottoman Empire's demographics, enmities between Turk and Arab, Sunni and Sunni-Wahhabi. It paints a vivid picture of the Three Pasha triumvirate, their unforgivable warcrimes, blunders and colorful deaths. It documents the victorious Allies scramble to divide up the spoils of war through shifting alliances, how they backstabbed each other, misunderstood the people they sought to govern, and mismanaged their own bureaucracies.

Great context for trying to understand what the fuck is happening in the Middle East today.

### The Ottoman Empire was heterogeneous and diverse, with few unifying aspects other than a shared faith in Islam

- **One-quarter of the Empire’s population was not Muslim**, meaning Christians (various sects) and Jews were common in many parts of the Empire.
- Only about **5% of subjects paid direct taxes to the central administration**, reflecting how real power resided in local strongmen, religious authorities, or tribal chieftains.
- The old Ottoman Empire contained Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and many others but the Empire was formally governed according to **Sharia (Islamic law)**
- There is **no separation between Church and State**. The Caliph is both the Pope and the President.
- Known as the "sick man of Europe", the **Ottoman Empire was slowly disintegrating**. Officially, it still held on to the notion that Egypt was part of it despite British having unofficial control since 1882. Similarly, Bulgaria was officially an Ottoman province but became functionally independent in 1885 after the Russo-Turkish War ended in Russian victory.

### The Muslim middle east was complex in ways the colonizing British and French misunderstood

- Many branches of Islam haven’t recognized a central Caliph for a millennium.
- **Turks against Arabs**: Ottoman leadership was Turkish, especially after the rise of the Young Turks / CUP, and Arabs in the Levant, Mesopotamia, and the Arabian Peninsula felt discriminated against.
- The **Arabs were not internally unified**. It was often observed that many Arab chieftains together would soon develop internal disagreements.
- The Ottoman state was **officially Sunni; however, large Shia** populations existed in places like Iraq and parts of eastern Anatolia.
- **Hashemites against Saudis** conflict pitted Hussein bin Ali (Hashemites) against Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud (Saudis). The Saudis were **Wahhabis**, practicing a more puritanical version of the **same Sunni faith**. Additionally they fought over control of the oasis cities of Kurma and Turaba.

### Russia played a major role in the Middle East during WW1

- For the British, the Ottoman empire was a convenient buffer zone that protected its interests from Russia.
- **As the Ottoman Empire weakened, Russia eyed Constantinople**, trying to push southward to gain direct access to warm-water ports and potentially secure a route to the Mediterranean. Largely in response to this threat, the British and French felt like they had to enter the fray and get a slice of the pie.
- Conversely, The Young Turks (particularly leaders in the Committee of Union and Progress, or **CUP) nursed a pan-Turkic dream that extended into Russian Central Asia**, including the territory of today’s Turkmenistan.
- Around the time of the Sykes-Picot agreement during WW1, the British and French promised Russia a share of Constantinople once the Ottomans were defeated.
- **Germany helped smuggle Lenin back to Russia (the “sealed train”),** hoping a Bolshevik takeover would knock Russia out of the war (see [[Defeatist vs Defensivist camps in early 20th century]]).
- This maneuver drastically affected the Middle East because the Bolsheviks, once in power, abandoned many Tsarist territorial ambitions, though they still harbored ideological goals.
- The new Soviet regime sought to reconquer or reassert influence over territories the Tsarist Empire had formerly taken, including parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Soviets took Anzali and the created a short-lived “**Persian Socialist Republic**” demonstrated Russia’s direct meddling south of the Caucasus.

### Greek and Turkish war was vicious and led to massive population shifts

- Fascinating histories of **Salonica** (historically very Jewish) which ended up the Greek Thessaloniki and **Smyrna** (historically Greek) which ended up the Turkish Izmir.
- After World War I, Greece, supported by Britain, occupied parts of western Anatolia (including Smyrna) with hopes of reclaiming historic Greek lands.
- Under Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, Greek forces advanced deep into Anatolia, but Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), employed a strategic retreat.
- Once reorganized, Kemal’s forces counterattacked and pushed the Greeks back west. **Smyrna was deliberately set on fire**, resulting in large-scale destruction and death in the tens to hundreds of thousands. By the end of 1922, **over a million Greek refugees** had been driven out of what is now Turkey.

### The British perspective on Jews was prejudiced and consequential to the shape of the modern Middle East

- Antisemitic:
	- **Ottoman CUP Conspiracies:** Some British diplomats believed the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) was secretly under Jewish or “crypto-Jewish” control, seeing Freemasonry as a Jewish front to subvert the Ottoman Empire.
	- **Bolshevik Connection:** Similarly, after the Russian Revolution, British officials promoted the idea that the Bolsheviks were dominated by Jews—tying together Germany’s wartime maneuvers (Lenin’s “sealed train” operation was masterminded by Alexander Lvovich Parvus, born Israel Lazarevich Gelfand) with a broader fear of a “Jewish Peril”, the English translation of the Russian authored "Protocols of the Elders of Zion".
	- **Colonial Administrators’ Biases:** In Palestine, British officials on the ground sometimes held antisemitic or “Arabist” leanings, believing that Zionism complicated local governance and risking friction with Muslim communities.
- Pro-Jewish:
	- **Christian Zionism:** Some British leaders—e.g., David Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour—were deeply influenced by Christian religious convictions. They felt sympathy for the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine.
	- **Strategic Interests:** Others saw Zionism as a way to secure a loyal population in a key location near the Suez Canal route and to prevent other European powers (notably France) from dominating the Holy Land.
- Divisions among Britain's Jews:
	- **Edwin Samuel Montagu:** The first British cabinet minister who was Jewish, Montagu strongly opposed Zionism. He argued that equating “Jewishness” with a separate national identity undermined the status of British Jews who considered Britain their homeland.
	- **Herbert Samuel:** Another prominent Jewish politician who did favor some form of British-backed Jewish settlement in Palestine; he saw it partly in spiritual/religious terms and partly in strategic terms for the British Empire.
- In his 1920 article **Zionism Versus Bolshevism**, Churchill created a taxonomy of politically active Jews, noting that it was a critical time for Jews to decide between good (Zionism or Nationalism) and evil (Bolshevism).

### The Enver, Djemal and Talaat Pasha triumvirate of the dying days of the Ottoman empire was both colorful and extremely terrible

- **CUP Dominance:** The Committee of Union and Progress effectively took over the Ottoman government after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution and a subsequent coup. By 1913, these "Three Pashas" held near-dictatorial power in the Ottoman empire.
- They were **Turkish supremacists**, sidelining non-Turkish Muslim groups (e.g., Arabs, Kurds) and clamped down on Christian minorities (e.g., Armenians, Greeks), and **allied with Germany** to modernize Ottoman military power and reassert control by partnering with the Central Powers.
- **Armenian Genocide:** Talaat, Enver, and Djemal bear central responsibility for orchestrating the mass deportations and killings of Armenians in 1915–1916. Djemal’s brutality in particular extended to Armenian populations in Syria. **Djemal threatened the Jewish population in similar terms**, and was only [stopped by Erich von Falkenhayn](https://jcpa.org/the-german-officers-who-prevented-the-massacre-of-the-jews-of-palestine-in-world-war-i/), a German General.
- Enver Pasha initiated disastrous military campaigns, such as the **Sarikamish** operation against Russia, in which around 70,000 of his 100,000 Ottoman troops died—mostly due to freezing conditions and logistic failures.
- **Colorful exits:** Enver’s quixotic journey to Central Asia—trying to spark an anti-Bolshevik, pan-Turkic revolt—ended with his defeat and death. Djemal and Talaat also met violent ends, assassinated by Armenians avenging the genocide.

### The British empire was internally divided, with regional offices in direct conflict with the central government

- **Too much bureaucracy:** a hodgepodge of agencies—India Office, Foreign Office, War Office, Colonial Office—each with overlapping authority over Middle Eastern affairs
- **Regional HQ rivalries:** Britain had a critical base in **Cairo (Egypt)**, another in **Delhi (for Indian affairs)**, and separate outposts in the Gulf, Iraq, and Palestine. Administrators on the ground often pursued their own agendas, contradicting broader British policy.
- **Sir Mark Sykes’s Attempt:** In 1916, Sykes envisioned a central “Middle Eastern Department” to coordinate policy. However, **Lord Kitchener** folded it back under the Egyptian administration, effectively **keeping power with Cairo** rather than with a single London-based entity.
- **Case of Palestine:** On the ground, many British administrators (the “Arabists”) sympathized with local Arab leaders and resisted London’s pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration. This tension caused repeated clashes between **local governance** and **official policy** set by the Foreign Office in London.

### The Allied alliance was very fragile and ever-shifting. This was the "Great Game"

- **Britain vs. France in the Middle East:** Despite being wartime allies, they had conflicting goals. Britain often sought to dominate strategic zones (e.g., Palestine, Mesopotamia) while France insisted on securing Syria and Lebanon, leading to ongoing tension over carving up Ottoman lands.
- **Italy’s Unfulfilled Claims:** Italy entered the war expecting significant territorial gains (including parts of the Ottoman Empire), but was ultimately shortchanged at the peace negotiations. This fueled resentment within the alliance.
- **Greek vs. Italian Friction:** While Italy vied for areas of southwestern Anatolia, Britain and France supported Greek claims to Smyrna (Izmir). This stoked immediate discord between Allies who were ostensibly on the same side
- **Collapse of Tsarist Russia:** Initially integral to Allied strategy, Russia abruptly exited WWI after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which was facilitated by the Germans. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk upended Allied plans in the Middle East.
- **Betrayed Secret Deals:** Russia had been promised a share of Constantinople, but its new Bolshevik government published and then repudiated many of the Allies’ secret wartime agreements including the Sykes-Picot agreement, exposing fault lines between Britain, France, and others.
- **Separate Deals and Double-Crosses**: exhausted by war and its own internal turmoil, **France made an independent deal with the Turkish nationalists**, irritating Britain, which still backed Greek military ventures in Anatolia. **Britain cut side deals** with local Arab leaders, Zionists, and others, sometimes neglecting to inform its French or Italian allies, further undermining Allied coherence.
- **Paris Peace Conference (1919):** Britain, France, and the U.S. focused on European settlements, but each had a different vision for the postwar Middle East. Britain sought strategic control from Egypt to India; France clung to colonial ambitions in the Levant; the U.S. under Wilson was wary of old-style imperialism.
- The great powers involved in World War I, even while the war was raging, anticipated a continuation of the Great Game past the end of the war. This created fertile ground for the great game to continue into the 1920s and 1930s and from there to World War II. **It wasn't until the players were completely destroyed that the Great Game ended**. But now that the hegemony is over, they are beginning again.

### Churchill had an outsized influence in WW1 too

- **Pre-WWI Government Roles:** Churchill was elected to Parliament as early as 1900. By the 1910s, he rose to First Lord of the Admiralty (in charge of the Royal Navy).
- **Dreadnought Race:** Churchill focused on **modernizing Britain’s navy** and preserving its lead over Germany’s growing fleet. He felt compelled, for instance, to **seize two Ottoman battleships** under construction in British shipyards to bolster the Royal Navy.
- **Gallipoli Campaign:** Churchill vigorously supported an attack on the Dardanelles, aiming to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war by capturing Constantinople. This **naval assault followed by a land invasion** at Gallipoli proved a massive Allied failure, costing hundreds of thousands of casualties.
- **Reappearance in Government:** Despite the Gallipoli debacle, Churchill soon returned to high office. By 1921–1922, he served as **Colonial Secretary**, overseeing Britain’s new Middle Eastern mandates (Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine) that emerged from the Ottoman collapse.

### Random bits

- Uncle Sam Wants You is in fact a rip-off of [[Lord Kitchener Wants You]].
- Pan-Arabism is largely a British invention imposed on the Arab world. This includes the Pan-Arabic flag, an initially British designed and British produced item.


John Dee and the Empire of Angels by Jason Louv

I liked this book, although it could use a bit of additional structure. It came across my radar from a [podcast conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6P5LUsfRxE) between Rick Rubin and Jason Louv about the book. Although it exaggerates and studies Dee in arguably too much depth, it paints a fascinating picture of the Elizabethan age.

Dee's life began at the start of the Lutheran Reformation. In 1543 when Dee was sixteen, two monumental works were published: On the Structure of the Human Body, by Andreas Vesalius, and On the Revolutions of Celestial Bodies, by Copernicus, but the Royal Society was still a century away. In 1608, a year before Dee's death, Hans Lippershey invented the first telescope. Dee's was a liminal life in a transitional age. Quoth the book:

> Dee is an inexhaustible subject. In life, he stood at the crossroads between magic and science, between the medieval and the modern, between Protestantism and Catholicism, and between the terrestrial and celestial worlds themselves.

Dee himself had some scientific contributions, and wrote extensively on optics, astronomy, mechanics, inventing a pulley system for moving heavy weights that would gain popular use later in the century. Dee's interest in optics led him to a reputation for sorcery after he "conjured" an illusion of a flying scarab with a man on its back, terrifying his audience.

In Dee's work Propaedeumata, he proposes that the universe is a vast machine, foreshadowing works to come like Newton's Principia. Dee suggested that God created the universe using mathematics, and that by understanding mathematics (God’s ways in the world), one could work with or even guide the forces of creation. Since man stands between God and the Creation, and is made in God’s image, he is suited to work with God as an intermediary, and mathematics is the ideal science for doing so.

Dee used Copernicus' calculations to determine that eleven days and fifty three minutes should be removed from the new Gregorian calendar, but wisely left out Copernicus' heliocentric model from his report. This was his last major scientific contribution.

Eventually Dee moved on from science and cast himself as an adept rather than just a math professor, in hopes of finding a monarch that would shelter him. However the thing Monarchs actually wanted was the same thing as usual... money and power. And so Elizabeth was busy with her own alchemical experiments, and Dee repackaged his book Monas to portray himself as an alchemist, including critiques of sham alchemists of the day, with intimations that Dee might know how to produce the philosopher's stone. Simultaneously he was writing the the “Mathematicall Praeface” to Henry Billingsley’s massively successful and influential first English translation of Euclid’s Elements of Geometry.

## Critique: overly bombastic

Following Dame Francis Yates' "The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age", Louv makes bombastic claims that Dee and Kelly's influence on the western world was central to European, English, and American spirituality, geopolitics, and empire.

> The influence of Dee and the angelic system he and Kelly delivered to the world can be found in an astonishing number of the major turning points of Western history since Dee’s death—in the birth of modern science, in the creation of the secret societies that liberalized Europe and gave America its spiritual calling, in the creation of the state of Israel and its subsequent centrality to American foreign policy, and even in the genesis of the United States space program.

These statements are highly specious and reductive. Louv writes:

> Indeed, just as the work of St. Paul is responsible for turning the ideas of a Jewish messianic sect into a Holy Roman Empire, so is the work of Dr. Dee responsible for turning those of the Protestant dissenters into a global Empire of Angels.

St. Paul was one of very many contingent links for Jesus Christ to reach the prominence required to have Constantine convert the Holy Roman Empire. I don't think Louv's simplistic causal characterization is at all fair.

## The Great Chain of Being

Louv does a good job of providing context for the pre-enlightenment world Dee was born into. The canonical classification of divine and profane beings comes to us from the sixth century Christian Pseudo-Dionysius. He scaffolded the order of the world as follows:

Angels of presence, praising God:

- Seraphim speculate on the order and providence of God.
- Cherubim speculate on the essence and form of God.
- Thrones also speculate, though some descend to works.

Angels of government, spreading light:

- Dominions, like architects, design what the rest execute.
- Virtues execute, and move the heavens, and concur for the working of miracles as God’s instruments.
- Powers watch that the order of divine governance is not interrupted and some of them descend to human things.

Angels of revelation, able to communicate with humans:

- Principalities care for public affairs, nations, princes, magistrates.
- Archangels direct the divine cult and look after sacred things.
- Angels look after smaller affairs, and take charge of individuals as their guardian angels.

The Profane:

- Humans are in the unfortunate position of being able to commit both spiritual and physical sins—unlike angels and animals, who are either fully spiritual or fully physical.
- Animals, ranked within various orders—mammals, avians, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects.
- Plants, ranked in order from trees to fungus.
- Minerals, ranked by gems, metals, stones, and so on.

## Scientists on the woo spectrum

Many great scientists work on the frontier of the known. Thus they encounter plenty of ideas which are not tested and confirmed by the scientific community. As a forward thinking explorer of the unknown, some of your swings may end up as mega-hits, while others might be complete misses. As you do the work, they all look promising. It is only in retrospect that you can separate the scientific contributions from the occult tendencies:

| Person                           | Scientific contribution                | Occult tendency            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Isaac Newton (b. 1643)           | Calculus, light waves, laws of motion. | Alchemy and Rosicrucianism |
| Srinivasa Ramanujan (b. 1887)    | Number Theory contributions            | The goddess Mahalakshmi    |
| John Whiteside Parsons (b. 1914) | Solid-fuel rockets                     | Thelemite occultism        |
| John Nash (b. 1928)              | Game Theory contributions              | Aliens                     |

Louv writes eloquently about the occult's relation to science and religion:

> The occult occupies a treacherous liminal zone between the competing discourses of science and religion, both of which reject it. It is tiny, decentralized, largely overlooked by modern culture, unpoliced by the processes of licensing or peer review, and concerned with entirely subjective aspects of the human experience, making it a no-man’s land where scientists, if not angels, fear to tread.

Related to [[Science and religion are deeply compatible]].

## Dee's Mortlake library was extensive and frequented by Queen Elizabeth

Dee pitched the concept for a national library to Queen Mary but it was rejected. Instead he expanded his personal library at Mortlake, which grew to be the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.

During Dee’s life, Cambridge possessed only 451 books and manuscripts; Oxford, 379. Dee probably had about 2,000 books and 198 manuscripts at Mortlake.

> Elizabeth would regularly ride to Mortlake to visit Dee and his stacks. Dee’s network of contacts continued to encompass scientists, intellectuals, and foreign courtiers from across the British Isles and Europe. He kept company with many of the era’s leading lights, including the explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake, Abraham Ortelius (creator of the atlas), Elizabeth’s spymaster Francis Walsingham, and the astronomer and alchemist Tycho Brahe.

Upon his return from Eastern Europe, Dee found his collection ransacked and destroyed.

## Catholics vs protestants

Queen Mary (ruled 1553 - 1558), a devout catholic was named Bloody Mary by her protestant opponents. She attempted to reverse the English reformation and was not an intellectual.

Mary's successor Elizabeth I (ruled 1558 — 1603), nominally a Protestant, had a "coldly realpolitik view of faith". She was a child prodigy who grew up to be one of the greatest monarchs in English history. Dee became her astrological and scientific advisor, advocating for England's voyages of discovery and colonization, and coining the term "British Empire". Dee signed his letters to Elizabeth "007". The two circles symbolized the eyes of Queen Elizabeth (for your eyes only) and seven was the alchemist’s lucky number.

Dee himself vacillated between Protestantism and Catholicism depending on the political headwinds. Seeking to stay on Mary's good side, he became an ordained priest in one day. Louv observes the fierce battle between Catholicism and Protestantism, noting the relative tameness of Dee's more deeply held Hermeticist leanings.

> Alchemy and sorcery permeated society, but reality itself was also a battle ground between two metamagical systems—Catholicism and Protestantism. Beyond shared religious mythology, Catholicism had its saints, fetishes, sacraments, rituals, inter-cessionary prayer, and other magical technologies; while Protestantism had its evangelical fury and emphasis on individual relationship with Christ. Next to such intense systems of belief, whose wars extended to torture and mass murder, Dee’s Hermeticism looks positively sober—the forerunner of the science that would begin to emancipate humanity.

Dee often found himself in trouble over his religious beliefs, found by the French inquisition to be "not evil, but mad" and imprisoned briefly in 1564.

## What is Hermeticism

I once attempted a lecture about Gnosticism. I quickly abandoned it. Yet here I managed to glean some details about what Hermeticism was all about:

> Protestantism was only one of the belief structures challenging or running parallel to Catholicism. The others were Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and operative magic—three distinct yet intertwining schools of thought that informed the literate elite’s direct quest for divine knowledge, beyond the rote teachings of the Church.

> Hermeticism itself was a long-standing school of philosophy drawn from the study of the Corpus hermeticum, the magical texts attributed to the Egyptian priest, king, and philosopher Hermes Trismegistus, believed to be a contemporary and spiritual equal of Moses, which thus formed a source of wisdom on par with the Old Testament itself.

> Primary among these texts is the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, a book first appearing in Arabic sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries, and translated into Latin in the twelfth, which contains the root precepts of the entire genre.

> By the sixteenth century, interest in Hermeticism and Neoplatonism was growing among the European intellectual elite. And while Hermetic texts had long been jealously guarded and carefully written in code, the printing press was undoing much of that secrecy, bringing alarming new ideas to receptive minds.

> To use a modern metaphor, if the universe is a computer with its own finely ordered operating system, file structure, and languages, Hermeticism and Neoplatonism sought to understand the workings of the computer, while operative magic sought to program it.

## Christian Zionism and specious claims

Louv draws a direct causal link from modern American Christian Zionism to Dee's occult beliefs and practices. It feels to me like Dee's role here is exaggerated, but I think the ideological causality is right.

According to [a Pew poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2007/01/11/the-promised-land-and-the-second-coming/), one in three Americans believes that the state of Israel is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy of Christ's return.

Louv claims that Christian Zionists believe:

> that Britain’s failure to work toward a full Jewish state, and America’s urgent insistence on doing so, is responsible for the collapse of the British Empire and the transfer of global imperial primacy to America.

During Dee's time, Protestant groups practiced “Judaizing” by leaning into the Old Testament. The Puritans in particular rejected the residual Catholicism of the Church of England and wanted to live like God's original chosen people. When they left for American shores, they became American evangelicals.

Louv writes that during World War II,

> many Christian Zionists saw Hitler’s persecution of the Jews as a part of the divine plan to push Jews toward returning to Palestine and converting to Christianity. They therefore saw little need for America to intervene to prevent the Holocaust from occurring.

Louv includes a telling quote from Ronald Reagan:

> “For the first time ever, everything is in place for the battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Christ."

I'm intrigued by the ideology of Christian Zionism. Although they are some of the strongest defenders of Jews in the US, there is also a dark anti-semitic undercurrent, in that their concern is less about the well-being of the Jewish people as much as their use in bringing forth the apocalypse to ultimately "de-Judaize" them.

I found nothing to confirm Louv's claim that:

> Remarkably, John Dee’s fellow magus Isaac Newton predicted 1948 as the year of the Jews’ return to Palestine.

Having said that, Newton did predict the end of the world in 2060. Hopefully I'll live to see it. Wait I mean...

### The "British" Empire

At the time, Spain was the dominant Empire, extracting massive amounts of silver from its New World colonies. This in part led to the obsession about alchemy: to tip the balance of economic power.

The only credible challenger to Spain at the moment was Portugal, who had split the New World along the line determined by the Treaty of Tordesillas (see [Late Middle Ages](/books/late-middle-ages/)). Dee suggested the Queen make some changes:

> Dee, with his back pocket full of superior knowledge of geography, navigation, and optics, would soon suggest Elizabeth contest this, and expand into the New World not just to rival Catholic domination, but for economic growth.

Dee masterminded Drake's mission which resulted in a landing at Drake's Beach north of San Francisco. Further expeditions included one by Frobisher, where two ships, the Gabriel and Michael, named after two prominent archangels, were sent and discovered a sample of black ore which was believed to contain gold. This spurred an additional voyage which returned with 200 tons of it, but the ore turned out to be pyrite, a worthless fool's gold.

In November 1577, Dee presented a new imperial plan to Elizabeth, suggesting that England wrest control of the New World from Spain. Dee argued that Britain needed a continually operational navy, and that it also had natural advantages for the maritime trades.

> Establishing such a navy would make Britain nigh-on invincible (it did), and expansion of the British Navy and colonization of the New World not only had historical precedent but would surely raise vast riches for the Crown (it did).

Dee wrote explicitly that the Petty Navy Royal should have sixty 120-200 ton "tall ships", and twenty small warships staffed by thousands of men funded by taxation. Dee argued that this would pay for itself, as the wealth gained by taxation would trickle down to the English people.

## Arthurian New World?

Dee held the bizarre belief that America had been colonized by King Arthur and that his still-existing Arthurian colonies might be found in the Northwest Passage. Dee drew up maps on the foundation of the Arthurian claim to the New World sprawled from Florida to Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean.

> Mercator himself had written to Dee that King Arthur had sent an expedition of four thousand men into the seas near the North Pole, and that some of the members of the team had survived, with their descendants appearing at court in Norway in 1364. Also of interest was the Welsh legend of Madoc, a prince who supposedly explored the New World in 1170;

Dee’s use of the term "British" Empire long predated the use of the word British to mean the British Isles; it referred instead to Arthur’s legendary Britain.

Of course, voyages to the New World would fail to turn up any evidence of Arthurian settlements, undermining Dee’s claims.

## Hebrew and Enochian

Like Postel and Bacon, Dee thought the forces of creation were encoded into Hebrew, although even Hebrew would be an echo of the hypothesized primal language.

> The angelic language, Sledge argues, “begins to exist somewhere between being created and being discovered by Kelly under a state of increasingly pronounced epistemological inclusivity between the angelic revelation, his own thoughts, and the dizzying array of alterations in his consciousness brought on by the effects of the sessions themselves and/or mental illness.”

> As part of the process of transmitting the forty-nine calls, and elsewhere in the diaries, the angels delivered fragments of the angelic language itself—often referred to as Enochian (this is a later conceit, not contained in the original spirit diaries). This was the language spoken in the Garden of Eden; when Adam was corrupted by the demon Coronzom in the form of the serpent and exiled east of Eden, he had to invent the Hebrew language instead, which contained an echo of the angelic language—though without the true forms or pronunciation.

[Dee's Enochian alphabet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian#/media/File:Enochian_letters_(1583_manuscript).png>)

## Dee and Kelly's scrying sessions

Dee and Kelly's scrying sessions were bizarre. They often featured angels and archangels appearing in their midst and providing divine prophecy. The archangel Gabriel spoke to them on June 2, 1584. The archangel Uriel manifested a crystal out of thin air, to be used by Kelly as his scrying device. Through this medium, Dee and Kelly were given complex instructions for building temple furniture and other very detailed rituals:

> A gold ring upon which is written the name “PELE” that is to be worn by the working magician and corresponds to the Seal of Solomon, the ring said to be worn by King Solomon, who appears in 1 Kings, and used to command the demons with which he built his temple.

The sessions ranged from comical:

> However, Michael was still unimpressed. On April 28—five weeks since the previous action—he chided Dee and Kelly for their slackness in carrying out his instructions. Dee pleaded that he hadn’t had money to buy materials to make the lamen, ring, or Sigillum.

To completely psychedelic:

> Two birds reappeared, as big as mountains now, flying toward space. The first bird took stars into his bill, while the second took the stars from the first and put them back into the sky; they quickly repeated this process throughout the heavens. These birds now flew over cities and towns, breaking up the clouds and causing dust to fall from the walls and towers, thereby cleaning them. In the streets were “diverse brave fellows”—bishops, princes, and kings—that the wings of the birds struck down, while beggars, the infirm, children, women, and the elderly were left untouched.

> Now the birds lifted the corpses of four men from the ground, each of them wearing crowns, one of which was a child. Upon being raised into the air they parted into the four cardinal directions. Coming now to a great hill, the birds squeezed metals from the ground and threw them out; next tossing the withered head of an old man between their feet until it cracked open, revealing a stone the size of a tennis ball colored white, black, red, and green—the colors of the Watchtowers that would be later transmitted, and of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. Upon eating the stone, the birds became two men with bright white paper crowns, with gold teeth, hands, feet, tongues, eyes, and ears. On each were twenty-six gold crowns, and they carried bags of gold that they sowed upon the earth like seeds.

The scrying sessions continued in exile in Poland and the Czech Republic with more intense visions:

> Uriel transformed into a great spinning wheel of fire; after thrusting out his hands, the wheel appeared full of men’s eyes, with flames shooting out of it in four places. A great white eagle with monstrous red eyes, one the color of fire and one of crystal, now came and perched upon the wheel, carrying a scroll of parchment in its beak. Beneath this eagle appeared a great valley, within which was a great city six times the size of Krakow, full of ruined houses, with a river running by it.

(I want to feed this into a gen AI video maker...)

## Wife swapping

At some point in the scrying sessions Kelly was implored to marry. He indeed soon married, though he came to greatly resent his wife.

Later, while in Třeboň, Dee and Kelly were told by Madimi, an angel from their vision, that they must share everything they had, including their wives, in order to complete the first phase of the Apocapylse.

Understandably, their wives were appalled. Dee told Jane Dee that "the wife sharing had to occur; there was no other way". Kelly went through and consummated, but Dee did not. Unsurprisingly, this was the end of the line for Dee and Kelly's friendly collaboration:

> Dee, who had already given everything for his cause, and sacrificed all that he had gained for the promise of angelic insight, had now been taken by his partner—for his contacts, his status, his knowledge, his alchemical equipment, and even his wife’s favors, leaving Dee destitute and possibly with a son not of his own parentage.

## Dee in literature and legacy

Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus is an example of anti-occult sentiment of the late 16th century. Its titular character is likely based in part on Dee himself. Ben Jonson’s The Alchemist (1610) was also inspired by Dee’s legend, with both plays casting their respective sorcerers as tragic victims of their own ambitions. Prospero of Shakespeare's The Tempest is also likely to be inspired by John Dee.

> Instead of facing a martyr’s death, Dee had been pushed out of polite society and forced to bear the constant humiliation of dashed hopes. Even his neighbors soon refused to offer him loans.

Louv also argues that Dee deeply inspired Francis Bacon, although Dee became untouchable because of his association with sorcery, and was not explicitly mentioned in Bacon's writing.

> Bacon nowhere mentions Dee in his two works, though he surely stood on the great educator’s shoulders. He also makes no mention of mathematics, still inseparably connected to Dee in the English mind. These omissions, Yates argues, were not from oversight or lack of debt, but because Bacon feared repeating Dee’s treatment by James I.

And Francis Bacon is the guiding spirit of the Royal Society. Again I find this to be a pretty tenuous link, but as I read this book, I mentally replaced Dee with the _je ne sais quoi_ spirit of the Elizabethan age Dee represented.

## Dee's occult descendents

Edward Alexander Crowley founded a modern Magick order called Thelema. His books like "The vision and the Voice" reveals a complex cosmology that sounds intriguing, at least in Louv's retelling, especially as it relates to [[Negative theology and via negativa]].

However the historical details are grim. Crowley appears to be a terrible person individually, while also promulgating a variety of questionable practices: perverse sex, hard drugs, mind control. He is also a self-declared antichrist. In summary, a rather unattractive package, for example:

> Crowley’s rather cowardly refusal to help several men trapped by an avalanche during his Kanchenjunga expedition; his decades of cocaine, ether, and heroin addiction and the resultant ugly interpersonal behaviors these drugs engender; his often sociopathic treatment of women, students, and hired help; his extreme racism and anti-Semitism (including a line in his Magical and Philosophical Commentaries, III:11, in which he calls Jews “the parasites of man,” which has been deleted from later editions), and so on . . . and so on . . . and so on

Louv's account of the various offshots of Dee's esoterics is long and esoteric, covering weird persons associated with Crowley's A∴A∴, such as Charles Stansfeld Jones who in Vancouver founded the first Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) lodge in North America.

But then he switches gears a bit and catches my attention again with the figure of John Whiteside Parsons, a sci-fi fan, Enochian magician, JPL founder, and inventor of solid rocket propellant.

> Parsons straddled the worlds of science and the occult. Like Dee, he saw centuries ahead of his time. Like Dee, his personality was too complex and interests too far-reaching to easily compartmentalize—picture Faust, Elon Musk, Hugh Hefner, and Abbie Hoffman in one man. Like Dee, he would be instrumental in expanding humanity’s horizons, in this case not just to a new continent but to new worlds, for which he would be uncredited, unthanked, and forgotten. Like Dee, he would immerse himself in Enochian magic, working the system with a charlatan associate who would betray and defraud him just as Kelly had Dee. Like Dee, he would lose everything.

Apparently inspired by Greek Fire, Parsons developed GALCIT-53, solid-state rocket fuel, solving problems with previously too-volatile formulations.

In 1939, along with the rest of the Thelema crew, Parsons rented a mansion called Agape Lodge, an experiment in communal living inspired by Parsons' Marxism and Crowley's Abbey of Thelema:

> This was a forerunner of the similar experiments of the Beat and hippie generations to come. Parsons was soon reveling in orgies, ritual magic, drug use and abuse, polyamorous hysterics.

He began composing Vogon poetry:

> I height Don Quixote,
> I live on Peyote, marihuana, morphine, and cocaine.
> I never knew sadness but only a madness that burns at the heart and the brain.

Parsons short life took a turn for the worse after he met L. Ron Hubbard. Together they begin their own sessions, Parsons acting as evoker and Hubbard acting as the scryer, mirroring the Dee-Kelly partnership. I had previously known of L. Ron Hubbard only for his involvement in Scientology and for his famous bet with Frank Herbert. This adds additional color to the demented man.

Like Dee and Kelly, they ventured deeply into the occult and sexual, with Parsons meeting Marjorie Cameron, a new tenant at the Lodge, who he decided was the Scarlet Woman, also known as Babalon. Meanwhile Hubbard's scrying began to increasingly resemble science fiction writing.

Parsons was like Dee:

- Both responded to the pain of rejection and the collapse of their scientific careers by retreating into the world of the occult.
- Both would be cuckolded, with Dee giving his wife over to Kelly, and Parsons being taken by Hubbard for his young girlfriend Betty.
- Both would be taken advantage of financially. Hubbard convinced Parsons to buy three yachts in Miami, which they would sail through the Panama Canal to the West Coast and then sell at a profit. As soon as Parsons agreed, Hubbard absconded to Miami with his money and Betty, leaving Parsons broke.

L. Ron Hubbard sounds like a total piece of shit. Parson's short life ended in tragedy, at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion in 1952.

Louv has a very specific interpretation of Super Bowl XLIX:

> As the personification of female sexual liberation, anti-Christianity, open sexuality, witchcraft, and the occult, Babalon is much more popular in our current world than Christ—so much so that in 2015, Katy Perry appeared as Babalon herself at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show, the largest and most central spectacle of mainstream American life. Bedecked in scarlet red flames, Perry emerged onto the field riding a towering portrayal of the solar, golden Beast, afterward dancing on a Masonic checkerboard while asking her viewers if they wanted to “play with magic” and telling them, as Babalon does in “Liber Cheth” and “The Book of Babalon,” that “once you’re mine, there’s no going back". This monumental and compelling spectacle, which greatly upset conservative Christians, nonetheless drew over 118.5 million viewers—the largest audience in Super Bowl history, and most certainly for a Thelemic ritual. It is hard to imagine a more definitive symbol of Crowley’s Thelemic worldview, and Babalon herself, winning the culture war. It’s a long journey from the visions of two English alchemists in 1587 to the Super Bowl halftime 428 years later, but then, goddesses presumably think on a long timeline.

I can't tell if Louv is joking. Did the producers of Katy Perry's act think about the Whore of Babalon when the produced it? Did conservative Christians truly react negatively to it?

Anyway, a provocative and intriguing but very esoteric read.
