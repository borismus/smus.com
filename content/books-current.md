Absolutely On Music by Haruki Murakami
===
rating: yes
posted: Oct 3, 2024
cover: /assets/book-covers/absolutely-on-music.jpg

This book situates the reader as a fly on the wall during multiple personal discussion between Haruki Murakami and his friend Seiji Ozawa. Ozawa was an accomplished classical conductor who was the music director of many world-class symphonies including SF, Toronto, and Boston. I didn't know much about Ozawa before reading the book, but after reading and listening, I liked his interpretations. Overall worth it for me, but mostly as a forcing function to listen to more music. Mahler's first Symphony, and Ozawa's rendition of it really grew on me.

It is often said that “writing about music is like dancing about architecture.” My remedy to this critique was to listen to the music being discussed in parallel to reading the book. Murakami did provide time codes for the pieces being discussed so that the reader could follow along. But I would have benefitted from having the specific recordings they discussed up-front, rather than scouring for them online, and only realizing that the Murakami provided a website with the recordings under discussion at the end of the book.

I found listening-while-reading clunky. Coordinating the two activities detracted from both. Perhaps a podcast would be a better medium to bring the consumer into the Ozawa-Murakami interview setting? Song Exploder is the only music podcast I've listened to, but now I've found a couple of others I'm curious about (not an endorsement, since I haven't listened yet):

- Embrace Everything: The World of Gustav Mahler
- Sticky Notes with Joshua Weilerstein

I was slightly annoyed at Murakami for flexing that he’s got these rare recordings, but he rights himself by including an aside in which Ozawa mocks excessive record collectors. Also annoying was Murakami's performative redaction: “unfortunately can’t commit anecdotes to print”. Lastly, I found the dialog to be too much about famous musical personas rather than the music itself. One example is the idea of "Ma" — the silence between the notes which make the music. This promising concept made multiple appearances in discussing Gould's unorthodox timings as well as Uchida's style, but remained a shallow discussion focused on the performers.

Ozawa's observations while living in Vienna resonated with my own trip. During that week, my mom and brother visited many art museums too. There I discovered Schiele's art, which left a huge impression on me, and I was surprised he made the cut. But it's true that seeing both the art and the music together really helped me synthesize. Quoting Ozawa now:

> when I first saw the work of Klimt and Egon Schiele, they came as a real shock to me. Since then, I've made it a point to go to art museums. When you look at the art of the time, you understand something about the music. Take Mahler's music: it comes from the breakdown of traditional German music. You get a real sense of that breakdown from the art, and you can tell it was not some half-baked thing.

It was fascinating to be a fly on the wall as two Japanese men discuss cultural legacies of Jewish musicians, especially Mahler. Discussing the klezmer part of Mahler's first symphony (3rd mvt), Ozawa says:

> And on top of that, he [Mahler] was a Jew. But come to think of it, the city of Vienna gained a lot of its vitality by taking in culture from its surroundings. You can see this in the biographies of Rubinstein and Rudolf Serkin. Viewing it this way, it's easy to see why popular songs and Jewish klezmer melodies pop up in Mahler's music all of a sudden, mixing into his serious musicality and aesthetic melodies like intruders. This diverse quality is one of the real attractions of Mahler's music. If he had been born and raised in Vienna, I doubt that his music would have turned out that way.

To which Murakami replies:

> All the great creators of that period —Kafka, Mahler, Proust—were Jews. They were shaking up the established cultural structure from the periphery. In that sense, it was important that Mahler was a Jew from the countryside. I felt that strongly when I was traveling around Bohemia.

Overall, I didn't find too many other deep insights in this book but I enjoyed the music quite a bit, especially the initial discussion of Beethoven's third piano concerto and Mahler first symphony. At some point in the conversation, Ozawa and Murakami discuss Japanese jazz musicians. Here are some names they dropped:

- Junko Onishi
- Toshiko Akiyoshi
- Shin’ichi Mori
- Keiko Fuji


Neurobiology of We by Daniel Siegel
===
rating: no
posted: Sep 22, 2024

This book came to my attention because of S's interest in "The Developing Mind", Daniel J. Siegel's magnum opus. Some of the ideas related to memory integration and childhood attachment theory sounded interesting enough to delve into, but the book itself was too long. Luckily Siegel is a prolific writer, producing many popularizations of his research for a variety of audiences, from parents to mindfulness practitioners. I picked up "Neurobiology of We" because it was short and relatively highly rated.

The book has many new-to-me ideas like the emphasis on "memory integration", as well as one way to distinguish between mind and brain. It also has plenty of things that are very speculative and don't seem especially well grounded in science. Let me be clear though; I'm familiar and interested in "dancing with woo" (Entangled Life, Every Life is on Fire. etc). In this case, however, the woo is enmeshed with a bunch of science: regions of the brain, studies which probably would not replicate, etc. I like my woo pure and unadulterated.

### Integration of memories
- Different kinds of memory:
	1. Implicit memories, which you don’t really put into words. Anything before 18 months falls into this bucket, but new implicit memories can also be formed at any age.
	2. Explicit memories which are associated with symbolic understanding.
	3. Autobiographical memories of certain memorable events.
	4. Narratives where the subject synthesizes multiple autobiographical memories and then generalizes the pattern.
- Different kinds of memories (see above) get integrated in the hippocampus. (Also see [[Sleep has a profound effect on memory and learning]])
- Under great stress, the hippocampus shuts down and so the connections between implicit and explicit memories are no longer clear. In extreme cases, people can confuse reality for memory, leading to PTSD-induced replays of traumatic events.
- Unintegrated implicit memories are potentially psychologically harmful.
	- A motivating example from the book: one of your kids is favoring your wife and not you. You don't realize it but it recalls in you an implicit memory of being favored by your mother over your sister as a young child. Whenever your kid calls for mama, you physically tighten and have a giant mood change, and you don't even know why. Since you haven’t integrated this memory and with something explicit and haven't thought about it and dealt with it then it’s just a free floating implicit memory. But if you’ve integrated then you can step back, find space, and realize what’s happening and perform a self intervention to avoid your extreme reaction.
	- (My analogy: in chemistry, free radicals are highly reactive atoms, molecules, and ions containing unpaired electrons. They are often created as a byproduct of metabolism in the body, and their instability causes to them to spontaneously react with other entities in the body and cause health problems. Similarly, unintegrated implicit memories are formed as a result of living one's life with insufficient reflection. Their volatility can appear spontaneously if one encounters a situation triggering an unintegrated implicit memory, causing mental health problems.)

### Distinction between mind and brain
- I liked the hub-and-spoke model where the mind sits inside an inner hub and regulates the activity happening on the exterior ring. The two are connected by spokes. This is a useful mental model for the mind vs brain distinction, and lends itself to mindful awareness, where the calm and balanced interior mind watches the chaos of the exterior world as reflected to it by the nervous system.
- The brain here is broadly construed as the entire nervous system, including all parts of the brain as well as all neurons throughout the entire body.

### Intriguing but woo leads
- Fight, flight, and **freeze as responses**?
	- "Fight-or-flight" was originally formulated by Walter Bradford Cannon as a sympathetic nervous system response to threats preparing an animal for fighting or fleeing. Siegel applies this to humans and adds the "freeze" response, in which the subject becomes completely overwhelmed and begins to feel completely stuck.
- Intuition stems from neurons coming from the heart and from the stomach?
	- Could it be that gut feelings actually do stem from the gut?
	- I read a paper on this called "Gut Signals and Gut Feelings: Science at the Interface of Data and Beliefs", and the current scientific answer is basically "no".
	- That said, there is a gut-brain-gut connection and there are well documented studies that show that stress affects digestion, for example IBS is likely stress-related.
	- The article does caution: "The gut-brain-gut communication network is part of the interoceptive circuits which enable the brain to sense and interpret the physiological condition in the body and regulate its autonomic and mental activity accordingly. While this relationship has become an important research area in neuroscience, it also provides an example where solid science is at risk going uncritical and fostering unproven conceptions and expectations."
		- For example, intestinal 5-HT (serotonin) is unlikely to contribute to the “feel-good” action of cerebral 5-HT because it does not pass the blood-brain barrier. To the contrary, an excess of 5-HT in the gut can elicit nausea.
- Integration of all the things?
	- At the start of the book, Siegel draws a triangle between mind, brain, and ...people. Hence the neurobiology of **WE**. He frames the whole endeavor as a series of information flows and claims to take an information theory perspective (ooh!)
	- Unfortunately I was unable to any information theory concepts or analogies for any of the subsequent content. Although information is passed between mind and brain, and between brain and other people, I don't think this is enough to call it "information theory".
	- It feels to be like brain and mind are a useful dyad, but bringing in "people" into the mix felt out of place. One specific critique of the triad is the murky connection between "mind" and "people". Doesn't that necessarily go through "brain"?



Entangled Life by Merlin Sheldrake
===
posted: Aug 28, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/entangled-life.jpg

Entangled Life is about the world of fungi, especially focused on the symbiosis between mushrooms and plants, called mycorrhiza. This symbiosis is achieved through the entanglement of plant roots and fungal mycelia. Mycelia are underground networks built out of hyphae, thin and long strands of fungal material. Hypha branch and grow and connect with other fungi and plants. In most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth. The part that lives underground is collectively called a mycelium.

**Aside on mushrooms**. The most charismatic fungi are the edible mushrooms. They are sometimes beautiful, delicious and/or healthy. However, the mushroom is just the tip of the fungal iceberg. More accurately, it is the fruiting body, used as a mechanism to ultimately release spores. Incidentally, Mushrooms are built out of the same intertwined hyphae as mycelium, but present as a single entity. Most of the action and growth happens underneath in the mushroom's mycelial network.

Mushrooms are just one type of fungus. In general, fungi are extremely variable in phenotype, from microscopic to the largest living organisms.

**Fungal impact**. Throughout the book, Sheldrake sings praises to the many ways in which fungi have made a huge impact on the world in ways that are easily recognizable in everyday life:

- Edible mushrooms, are delicious and some are extremely valuable (e.g. Truffles)
- Psychedelic mushrooms lead people to intense states of mind
- Bread and beer are due to yeast, microscopic fungi consisting of solitary cells which incidentally don't have hyphae.
- Slightly rotten fruits: at some point our primate ancestors evolved resistance to alcohol which was previously poisonous. This unlocked a whole new source of food: fermenting fruit, which was shunned by many other animals. This also potentially explains why humans love booze, colloquially known as the [drunken monkey hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_monkey_hypothesis).
- Many eastern and western medicines are based on fungi. [Penecillin](https://invention.cards/penicillin) was first discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 when a strange mold was found to have antibacterial properties. A more modern example, the discovery of statins in a mold called Penicillium citrinum was a huge boon and made Merck lots of money.

**Fungal sensing** Fungi actively sense and attract one another. They know themselves from other organisms, despite having a very wide-ranging fungal network. Some species can sense and attract worms.

**Fungal reproduction** happens through sexual reproduction, but rather than having two sexes, there are thousands. The main point is that just like with humans, you need different sexes to make offspring. It seems like the main goal is to avoid self-insemination which would decrease genetic diversity. More on this on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophyllum_commune).

**Contrast with charismatic megafauna**. The most charismatic of all life are the charismatic megafauna. Next are other animals. Then it’s tall trees. Then a bunch of minor animals and plants you rarely think about. Then the cute insects, like butterflies and ladybugs. Mushrooms might be next. Fungi even further down the line. (See [[Charismatic mega-fauna and repugnant mini-flora]])

### New lenses

**Magic shows are curiosity pumps**. After a magic show, you see the world differently. No longer do you see what you expect. Instead, you look with fresh eyes, a blank slate without preconception of what the world should be like. As one ages, the default is to experience this less and less. But I think books like this one help bring that sense of awe and wonder back to people.

**Boundaries between individuals and ecosystems**: I'm fascinated by the boundary when an individual becomes an ecosystem. For example, a human can be viewed as an individual even though biologically we depend on many microorganisms, some which are fungi. There is also groups of people, and much of our societies are based on the successes of group activities.

**Everything alive is not a thing but a process**. This lens is generative, interesting and very deep. William Bateson, who coined the word genetics, observed, 'We commonly think of animals and plants as matter, but they are really systems through which matter is continually passing.' (See [[Objects as processes. Verbs as nouns]] and [[Energy flows, but matter cycles]])

**Extended phenotype**: Interesting idea about the extended phenotype. Beaver dams under this definition are part of their expressive phenotype. This idea is due to Dawkins.

**Horizontal gene transfer**: Recent major advances in biology are due to horizontal gene transfer through symbiotic-like processes. Horizontal gene transfer is so fascinating. This is the main way bacterial individuals acquire genes. The transfer happens across domains and kingdoms. Also see Lynn Margulis' endosymbiotic theory.

### Crazy fungal examples

**Zombie fungus** Such a crazy situation with the ant and the fungus that takes control over this animal. Related to the ergot fungi. These things are called [Zombie-ant fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis).  Another bizarre and lucrative fungi, [[Caterpillar fungus]]. Is that another zombie fungus?

Crazy to think about, but an infected ant is a fungus in ant's clothing. This is a much more dramatic transformation than the one that people have when they have some gut microbio him dysfunction.

**Magic mushrooms**: Default mode network (DMN) is the thing that is suppressed by psilocybin. This enables a bunch of new neuronal connections all around.

Terence McKenna thought that if you took a large enough dose for mushrooms you could feel like the mushroom is acting through you in the same way that the anti-fungus essentially controls the end fully.

It’s unclear whether psilocybin is a poison or an appealing thing for animals.

**Truffles** grow completely underground. They are visually unattractive it completely makes up for it with their smells, which are strong enough to pass through soil!


### Mycorrhizal networks
The plant-fungi relationship with mycorrhiza is mostly symbiotic & mutualist but sometimes parasitic. Mycorrhiza also help plants survive, droughts and provide other minerals like nitrogen. And further make arousal net work the plant is able to provide some large percentage of its carbon, something like 30%. Together this world of mycorrhiza forms a rhizosphere. (See [[Mature and immature biosphere noosphere technosphere]])

Mycorrhizal fungi act as a mediator and buffer between plants in a forest ecosystem. They can break down rocks and dense soils that plants cant and provide minerals. And they need carbon from plants. So they act as brokers on a trading floor.

Unlike most plants, Voyria and other [myco-heterotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myco-heterotrophy) do not contain chlorophyll and get their food through parasitism upon fungi rather than photosynthesis. Their roots are thick and densely clustered, forming a "birds nest" that house their fungus host.

90% of plants depend on mycorrhizal networks. Historically, these mycorrhizal networks enabled algae to become able to live on land.

If you take out all the mycorrhizal networks and leave them at length you get something that is like greater than the diameter of the known universe. On one hand this is impressive, but on the other a meaningless comparison. A more relevant factoid is that if you create a 2D woven fabric out of all mycorrhizal roots, you can envelop the earth twice.

**Intersection with modern farming practices** has been pretty detrimental to mycorrhizal fungi because of a combination of deep plowing and chemical pesticide use. An analogy from medicine: when you take antibiotics, you obliterate the Microbiome of your body, destroying all micro organisms, both the ones causing the disease, and the ones that are beneficial. The result is less diverse life in general, as well as the impoverishment of the soil. No mycorizal networks means there’s no breakdown of rocks and minerals remain locked up. This all rhymes with other pitfalls of high modernism (see [[The Authoritarian High-Modernist Recipe for Failure]]).

**The wood wide web** is a fun name for the rhizosphere network. It features are a clear set of carbon sources and sinks. Large trees have priveleged access to the sun, so can photosynthesize really well, producing tons of carbon. They can then feed excess carbon to smaller trees.

Sometimes young plants start out as carbon sinks and grow into carbon sources later. This is the case for Orchids, for example.

But why would this happen? Evolutionarily it doesn’t make sense. What's the benefit for the plant to give fungus carbon so that it gives it to neighbor? This entire perspective is overly Tree centric.

In the wood wide web metaphor, trees are routers and mycorizal connections are cables. But this is misleading. On the internet, connections between routers are just wires, entirely passive. In the forest, the connections are fungal, and fungi have agency. They can decide who to give from and who to take from, and how much.

Rather than taking a tree-centric view, let's flip this graph of edges and vertices around (see [Line graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph)). A fungi-centric view of this explains a lot. A fungi benefits if it exists in a diverse ecosystem and will do what it must to achieve those ends. But this is just one of many framings. Sheldrake is great at lensical thinking:

> How best to think about shared mycorrhizal networks then? Are we dealing with a superorganism? A metropolis? [...] Nursery schools for trees? Socialism in the soil? Deregulated markets of late capitalism, with fungi jostling on the trading floor of a forest stock exchange? Or maybe it’s fungal feudalism, with mycorrhizal overlords presiding over the lives of their plant laborers for their own ultimate benefit. (190–91)

### Lichens are hybrid organisms
A lichen is an organism that is a combination of fungus and algae.

Any fungi and algae tend to symbioses spontaneously. When this happens, fungi partner with algae for the purpose of photosynthesis symbiosis.

Lichen can dehydrate themselves and go dormant. And rehydrate after months. Or in extreme cases years.

Toby Spribille found recently that lichen can be way more complex than a single symbiosis between algae and fungi. He found the presence of yeast cells as an additional fungal component of some lichens.


### Evolution of fungi and plants from 1500 ma to 290 ma

(A lot of this is my piecing together things from this book alongside other articles. I hope I got it right — ish? It's really fascinating...)

**Landed plants.** Fungi diverged from other life around 1500 ma, and were some of the first complex life forms on land, mining rocks for mineral nourishment, slowly turning them into what would become soil. Then by the Ordovician era, about 450 ma, they began forming symbiotic relationship with liverworts, the earliest plants. Fungi had helped to create land-dwelling plants

**Evolution of trees**. Plants gained a new adaptation: they began to create wood out of cellulose and lignin. This led to a huge reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere since all of that carbon was now needed to create gigantic trees. This led to a giant temperature decrease and an instability in the environment. This all happened around the Devonian period, about 350 ma.

**Stockpiling wood.** The proliferation of large trees led to a giant stockpile of dead trees which simply grew over many millions of years. Without any mechanism for breaking down this vast amount of wood, it simply accumulated and compressed, and became responsible for a large amount of the coal humanity benefits from today.

**Evolution of wood decomposers.** By the Carboniferous period, about 290 ma, some fungi evolved to process lignin and then feast on the delicious cellulose hidden within these dead trees. Much of the tree mass accumulated during the Devonian period had become inaccessible, buried under sediment due to erosion. However, newly dead trees were now being munched on by these hungry fungi (white rot). Decomposition was in full swing.

Interestingly, fungal decomposition of plants is by far a larger source of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere than anything human caused. By an order of magnitude?

### Random tidbits
- [Cedar Enzyme Baths](https://www.osmosis.com/cedar-enzyme-bath/) are a thing that can be experienced in Japan and in California.

> 	In its contemporary form, the Cedar Enzyme Bath received international attention in 1972 when it was offered at the Olympic Games in Sapporo, Japan as an opportunity for athletes to quickly recover from the stress of exertion.  Over the past half century, many parts of Japan have adopted it, often in clinical environments that promote its therapeutic benefits.

- Look into Peter Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid" written in 1903. He was a Russian and then Soviet anarchist who challenged the "everything is competition" narrative popularized by Darwin.
- Look into Kevin Beiler [map](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03069.x) of 30 x 30 m in British Columbia where he tracks in the connections between Douglas Fir through various kinds of mycorrhizal networks
- [[Flatworms can regrow new brains and transfer memories to them]]. Shocking.
- Who knew I'd be discovering this amazing Tom Waits song: [[Tom Waits - Green Grass]], which I really like!

### Organizations and companies
- Peter McCoy seems to be very busy online. [Mycologos](https://mycologos.world/pages/school) teaches fungi-focused skills though online and hands-on courses. Radical mycology hosts events, e.g. Rad Myco 7 - Sept. 26-29 @ Mulino, OR.
- [Ecovative](https://www.ecovative.com/) subtitled "Mycelium Technology" makes a variety of products out of mycelium, from food to foam to leather to the packaging these items ship in.

### Random musings
- Why do so few mushrooms or fungi live underwater?
- How quickly would you die if all fungi became extinct? What would you die from?



Blindsight by Peter Watts
===
posted: August 1, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/blindsight.jpg

Blindsight was recommended to me by GB, DK, and maybe NA. I resisted for a long time, but as the recommendations piled up, I decided it was time. I was not disappointed. The book is masterfully written, a slow and often baffling build (wtf, vampires?) culminates in an excellent story with lots of twists and turns. This is indeed a hard science fiction book and really shows off how good fiction can be at articulating complex ideas (see [[Power of Fiction]]).

The characters are compelling too, especially Isaac Spindle, who I think reminded me a bit of VJ. The scene when Cunningham begins to recite Yitgadal was wildly unexpected and made me realize that I kinda missed Spindle! The Vampire Jukka Sarasti was my favorite though. In an odd way he reminded me of AH, at least in his brute intelligence. I also really liked that "Vampire Logic" was basically abduction (see [[Abductive reasoning — Inference to the Best Explanation]]).

This book is packed with ideas.

**Lensical thinking** involves being able to see something from multiple lenses, or different perspectives (see [[Multiple lenses are required to understand anything complex]]). For humans this is not easy, and changing lenses requires deliberate practice. Further, only one lens can be tried on one at a time. Vampires in Blindsight can see both sides of the Necker cube simultaneously. This reminds me a bit of a cool concept I recently learned about called double consciousness, in which theory of mind becomes a survival skill (see [[Double consciousness — oppression increases lensical thinking]]).

**Multiple personalities**. Fascinating discussion around Multi Personality Disorder (MPD). One of the protagonists is a in fact four. These four personalities each have their own dedicated space inside a shared brain. This quadfurcation was done deliberately by the original human owner of the body as a sort of "CPU sharing" scheme. You can tell who is in control only from changes in mannerisms, gait and slight variations in voice.

Watts looks back at our current moment from a bird's eye view, 100 years into the future. From this vantage point, it is widely considered that carnivorism will be an appalling and disgusting primitive practice. In the same vein, what if the way we handle MPD/DID is also barbarous, administering drugs to suppress all these potential other lives-within-lives. Trust me, it's a more compelling argument in the book. Aside: I'm reminded of my prospective renter experience who turned out to be a Tulpamancer. Ask me sometime over a beer.

**Unconscious intelligence**. Shortly after first contact with Rorschach, the entity seems to communicate. This is initially exciting but after extended conversations it seems that Rorschach is an LLM. It's not really conscious, nor does it have a stable identity. Did it just quickly learn human communication patterns during it's enveloping of Earth? This is a great way to land the reader into a scenario and internalize the Chinese Room thought experiment. I am reminded of my belief that thought experiments are best understood through fiction (see [[Power of Fiction]]). Once enveloped inside a world where the thought experiment can root naturally, I find myself more receptive to consider the thought experiment more deeply.

**Is consciousness adaptive?** In one of Cunningham's diatribes, he observes that many sociopaths are in positions of power. These sociopaths lack self-awareness. Is the evolutionarily expedient adaptation to not be conscious? Would it be better if people were actually p-zombies? Imagine if intelligent beings didn't need to waste time any cycles thinking and modeling one another, recursively? I found these questions disturbing but interesting. Provocative and unanswered. Unanswerable?

**Superintelligence timewarps**. The scramblers are superintelligent and operate at a rate of perception that far exceeds human abilities. In addition to being mathematical geniuses, they seem to have a far superior set of reflexes, or perhaps just perceive the world at a much faster rate. They communicate at extremely high frequency, and also hide things from humans by doing things while humans aren't paying attention. They learned to perceive human blinks and eye saccades, and managed to use that information to hide in plain-sight.

I was thinking about this in context of a blinking traffic light. I saw the traffic light out of the corner of my eye, but perceived the light as broken, because my blinks coincided with it being off for two cycles. How little it takes to fool us!

**Vibe: unsettling horror**. In Blindsight, the whole world is actively hostile. Neither the captain (an AI) nor Jukka Sarasti (a Vampire) can be trusted. Rorschach and the scramblers seem likely hostile, but it's very unclear until the end. And the setting is in deep space extremely far from home. Everything and everyone feels volatile and perpetually ready to kill you in a way that reminded me of [Annihilation](/books/annihilation-by-jeff-vandermeer/).

**Vibe: what is reality** There's a masterfully written segment in Blindside about how Cygnus suddenly sees that his crew is no longer human, but actually made out of tiny, disturbing alien particles. Again I'm reminded of Annihilation... It's executed so well that for the rest of the book I didn't know if I've decided that it is true or not. Not sure if this is what Watts was going for, but it's a great illustration of seeing two sides of the Necker cube.

Suppose the entire crew had been replaced by strange alien cells created by this extraterrestrial super intelligence? The author seems to suggest that the answer to this question is "Yes". It might not matter too much. But if the crew is no longer "human", how about Cygnus himself? In the back of the reader's mind, the crew was never *really* human to begin with. They are all cyborgs of some sort, having melded with computers long ago. Is this further transformation that different or relevant?

At the end of the book, when you have all but forgotten that the crew is on an intelligent ship, the AI "Captain" re-emerges and appears to have been the one calling the shots all along. The Vampire was just a proxy for the ship because "We don't like taking orders from machines".

Provocations:

- Why would we expect higher beings to be merciful to us if we treat lower beings the way that we do?
- Are art and our general sense of aesthetics drived from our over-active sense of the mundane questions of say what makes a good habitat?


The Blessing of a Skinned Knee by Wendy Mogel
===
posted: May 20, 2024
rating: no

This is a Jewish take on parenting from a former psychologist who became disenchanted with her profession and sought wisdom in the tradition of her ancestors. I found myself nodding along in agreement to many of her ideas, which try to synthesize Jewish concepts with "common sense" parenting. Less charitably, this book can also be seen as a conservative reaction to modern parenting trends. Either way, a better than average parenting book. Thanks to LL for the recommendation.

Some things I liked:

- **A paradox**: parents aren't happy when there is nothing psychologically wrong with her child. If that's the case, then there's nothing to fix and the problem doesn't just go away through some clear intervention.
- **A parable**: keep one sheet of paper in each the left and right pockets of your jacket. The left note should say "I am a speck of dust", and the right should say "the world was created for me". Mogel refers to this classic parable from Rabbi Simcha Boonim. This spirit of keeping multiple lenses as well as being able to entertain opposite extremes is such an important skill for parents and a key part of how I want to be in the world.
- **An insight into the first commandment** "I am the Lord your God". This isn't a commandment in itself, as it doesn't really entail any action. Despite this, it serves as a preamble to the rest of the ten commandments, adding appropriate gravitas. Similarly, reminding children "I am your father" (but not like Darth Vader) may tautological, but is actually effective.
- **Deed over creed** is a great terse summary of the Jewish approach to na'aseh v'nishma (see [[Jewish tradition of doing first and understanding later - na'aseh v'nishma]])
- **Yetzer Hara**. Humans have a congenital inclination to do evil, but there can be a [positive role to the evil inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yetzer_hara#Positive_role_of_the_evil_inclination). What is the worst behavior of your child? The attributes that cause it might also lead to their greatest strength. If this "evil inclination" is something that has potential for positivity, perhaps it is a misnomer for chaos? This evokes the D&D concept of chaotic good which separates the simple axis of good and evil into the more complex 2x2. I also wrote a previous note along similar lines (see [[Embracing deviance as a value]]).
- **Mishegas** — a great Yiddish term for non-clinical craziness.

What I wanted to debate with the author:

- Mogel claims that children are asked to be generalists in a way that is unreasonable and never again relevant for adult life. My take on this is highly inspired by books like [Range - Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein](/books/range-by-david-epstein-audio/), which suggest that generalism in adults is underrated. In "Range", Epstein suggests that children should try a wide variety of activities to increase match quality.
- Mogel observes that many find the word "God" to be awkward to say, and that we ought to get over it. For me, "God" is a weird word to say mainly because it's so closely associated with trite concepts related to Jesus and a simple conception of God as a sort of bearded superman in the sky. Abstract Jewish terms like HaShem (literally "The Name") is a good workaround I think, although HaShem in particular connotes a deep religiosity which I do not possess. Does anyone call it "The Lord"? Sounds formal and creepy but kinda cool. Maybe I should try calling it "The Name"?

Most importantly, a parenting book should have parenting advice! I left "Skinned Knee" with many promising parenting ideas to incorporate into our life, but I'll spare you those details.

Annihilation was first recommended to me by KO. This book is a creepy combination of Roadside Picnic and Soylent Green. It was advertised to me as Sci-Fi, but I think it really leans into horror, which is Jeff VanderMeer's specialty.

I found this to be a captivating read with a very rich atmosphere, despite the world building being extremely shrouded in uncertainty. Nothing can be trusted. Neither your senses nor your sensors. The vibes this book emanates are unlike anything else I can remember. Reading this book gave me a perpetual sense of Déjà vu.

Annihilation was a very quick read. I don't plan to read the rest of the books in the Southern Cross trilogy yet, although I am somewhat intrigued. I hope that the next book reveals something about the authorities that send missions to Area X. I found this to be the most fruitfully mysterious part for a sequel.

Let me speculate about the book overall and provide my overall theory of what is happening in Area X. This is based on a book club discussion with VK, MM, MK & AK. What if Area X is a generalized next token predictor that uses human cells as its tokens? The gibberish writing spiraling inside the tower could have easily been generated by an LLM. What if this whole world of Area X is an LLM in biological space?

A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold

Inspired to read more about ecology after enjoying [Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth by J. M. Greer](/books/mystery-teachings-by-j-m-greer/), I picked up "Sand County Almanac". I'm not sure how I managed to miss this gem for so long.

Aldo Leopold was an ecosystems' genius, and this most famous book of his contains deep analysis couched in poetic but accessible prose. Leopold was one of the O.G. environmentalists, perhaps an east coast John Muir? I really loved this collection of essays, especially "Good Oak", "Axe in Hand" and "The Land Ethic". These three essays stand alone, contain great quotes, and should be required reading.

# Good Oak

In his "Good Oak" chapter, Leopold recalls felling a dead oak, peeling back the layers of time as his saw cuts through each annual circle in the cross-section of the tree. As he does this, Leopold recalls the history of his 80 acre Sand County farm from an Oak's perspective. This is such a great device, noticed by others as well, as in this blog post entitled [Tree Ring-Span Storytelling](https://forestbathingcentral.com/tree-ring-span-storytelling/). I loved this quote from the chapter:

> There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.

# Axe in Hand

"Axe in Hand" focuses on the almost god-like role of farmers, and a deep discussion on bias (along the lines of my [[Maybe biases are good]]). Leopold muses on why he prefers pine trees to birches, digging deeply and honestly to try to understand why. I'm impressed at the number of possible reasons he produces to favor the pine, but ultimately concedes:

> The only conclusion I have ever reached is that I love all trees, but I am in love with pines.

Farmers decide which plants should live and which should die. Improvements to farming tools are all still fundamentally concerned with doing these god-like activities more efficiently. It's an interesting sentiment expressed many years later, in 1968 by Stewart Brand "We are as gods and might as well get good at it". Leopold quotes "Tristram" by Edwin Arlington Robinson:

> Whether you will or not
> You are a King, Tristram, for you are one
> Of the time-tested few that leave the world,
> When they are gone, not the same place it was.
> Mark what you leave.

# The Land Ethic

In "The Land Ethic", Leopold describes a model for the natural world he calls the land pyramid. This is similar to the food chain, except with soil as the foundation. Leopold observes that soil is not just a place to plant things, but the substrate in which life can evolve and flourish.

The land pyramid tends to grow in height over evolutionary time, increasing in complexity as life figures out increasingly clever adaptations and ways of being. Leopold laments the loss of megafauna and other apex predators due to human over-hunting, as this flattened the land pyramid for the first time in a long time.

Leopold describes his conservationist philosophy in a few choice quotes:

> Ethical behavior is doing the right thing when no one else is watching- even when doing the wrong thing is legal.

> We are remodeling the Alhambra with a steam-shovel, and we are proud of our yardage. We shall hardly relinquish the shovel, which after all has many good points, but we are in need of gentler and more objective criteria for its successful use.

> A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.

Throughout the narrative, Leopold intertwines natural phenomena that were new to me and raised many questions in my mind:

- Rabbits apparently girdle Oak trees. (What does girdling mean? What is the rabbit-tree symbiosis he alludes to?)
- You can apparently tell how good a year was by the vertical spacing between branches on the trunk. (How do trees grow? How do bones grow?)
- I am really intrigued by this sky dance that the Woodcock does. They are [hilarious birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3-LvmHM4E).

"Sand County Almanac" is well worth a read or a listen.


Disappearance of Ritual by Byung-Chul Han

I recently read [The Burnout Society by Byung-Chul Han](/books/the-burnout-society-by-byung-chul-han/), a chaotic, disorganized read full of interesting ideas. "Disappearance of Ritual" continues in the same tradition, but I found the ideas presented in it somewhat weaker and less original than in "Burnout Society". In one section, BCH extols the virtues of beautiful and playful language and laments its disappearance. Yet he writes woeful passages like this:

> Delirious contiguity is the poetic principle of wit. The signifiers licentiously enter into neighborly relations without giving any consideration to the signified.

Blemishes aside, there are some diamonds in the rough in this work, but nothing really jumped at me as totally earth-shattering.

**Echoes of The Sabbath**: BCH explores the analogy that rituals are to time like dwellings are to space. Citing Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, "rituals are temporal techniques of making oneself at home in the world". Similarly, he uses rest as a sort of sacred ritual:

> Rest is not merely recovery from work, nor is it a preparation for further work. Rather, it transcends work, and it must in no way come into contact with work

Bizarrely, he does not quote [The Sabbath by Heschel](/books/the-sabbath-by-heschel/) which contains very similar ideas and predates Saint-Exupéry's "Citadelle" by 20 years.

**If Rituals did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Them**: BCH laments the loss of rituals in our modern society. Somewhat along the lines of [The Power of Ritual by Casper ter Kuile](/books/the-power-of-ritual-by-casper-ter-kuile/), he suggests that rituals make life more enjoyable, give form to our lifecycles, and bring variety. Because our society has given up on rituals, they need to be synthesized along the slightly cringe lines described in "Power of Ritual" and observed in rationalist solstices:

> The demand for individually designed rites to mark the phases of life and their transitional points is also on the increase, with the place of priests now taken by so-called ritual designers. These novel rituals have to obey the imperative of authenticity and creativity. But they are not rituals in the proper sense. They do not exert the symbolic force which directs life towards something higher and thus provides meaning and orientation. Where there is no longer a higher order, rituals disappear.

A ritualistic life is also less depressing. BCH argues forcefully that there can be no depression in a ritualistic society:

> In a society governed by ritual, there is no depression. In such a society, the soul is fully absorbed by ritual forms; it is even emptied out. Rituals contain aspects of the world, and they produce in us a strong relationship to the world. Depression, by contrast, is based on an excessive relation to self.

I this is overstated and that BCH presents an overly romantic view of ritualistic societies. That said, I have seen how needing to synthesize your own rituals leads people to a place of "narcissistic introspection" and depression.

**Learning things by heart is underrated**. I resonated with this idea, and I'll let BCH speak for himself here:

> Today, many forms of repetition, such as learning by heart, are scorned on account of the supposed stifling of creativity and innovation they involve.

> The cultural technique of deep attention emerged precisely out of ritual and religious practices. It is no accident that ‘religion’ is derived from relegere: to take note... Rituals are characterized by repetition. Repetition differs from routine in its capacity to create intensity.


**Politeness as ritual** that produces a positive mental state in all parties. Yet politeness is at odds with authenticity, and the latter wins in modernity. Quoting William James's "[Gospel of Relaxation](https://archive.org/details/onvitalreserves02jamegoog/page/n51/mode/2up)" fake it till you make it ethos:

> In order to feel kindly towards a person to whom we have been inimical, the only way is more or less deliberately to smile, to make sympathetic inquiries, and to force ourselves to say genial things. One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling.

BCH and I find deep wisdom in this:

> A ritual of politeness is not an expression of subjective feeling; it is an objective act. It resembles a magical invocation that produces a positive mental state.

**Ritual made ancient warfare better**. Towards the second half of the book, BCH goes on all sorts of wild tangents, covering a broad range of "bads", from capitalism to pornography in all sorts of blanket statements. It was sort of hard to extract value from the fragments there.

**Modernity compresses life's dynamic range**. BCH laments a sort of dynamic range compression over all spheres of life. On the play end of the continuum, leisure has been dumbed down to binge-watching Netflix, a far cry from the word's original sense, the freedom to pursue education in a way not directly concerned with productivity and profit. On the other end of the continuum, peak experiences lack "splendor, sovereignty, and intensity"

> Only weak play is tolerated, and it forms a functional element within production. The sacred seriousness of play has entirely given way to the profane seriousness of work and production. Life subordinated to the dictates of health, optimization and performance comes to resemble mere survival. It lacks splendor, sovereignty, intensity.

This is an incomplete thought, but a quote from Juvenal stuck with me, which is BCH's way of describing the modern condition:

> "losing the reasons to live for the sake of staying alive" (propter vitam vivendi perdere causas)

My romanticized analogy to the startup world is that entrepreneurs escape this form of weak play which predominates inside large corporations. Instead, they risk more and live with the prospect of honor and glory.

**Ritualized warfare was better**. Continuing on this of "strong play", BCH extends his observations to war. The way he tells it, ancient warfare was ritualized and game-like, with sovereign warriors as players, unafraid of death.

> The prohibition of certain weapons and the agreement on the time and place of battle underline the play-like character of war in the ancient world.

Ancient generals would be at the front of a column leading the charge. Alexander the Great was famously willing to put everything on the line for the sake of achieving his vision.

> According to the chivalric code, which had a decisive influence on the development of the notion of military honor in Europe, it is not honorable to attack an enemy without putting yourself at risk.

In contrast, modern warfare involves soldiers, which in his BCH-ish fashion, literally translates as "the one who is in someone's pay", from salary and salt. He risks his life not because he is a live player (see [[Live player vs dead player]]), but because he receives payment for it. And honor is rarely taken into account, with cynicism and realpolitik the dominant stances.

> The rules of the game to which all belligerents commit themselves ensure that, after the war is over, there is space left for politics. By contrast, killing without rules, pure violence, destroys the political space. War as large-scale dueling differs fundamentally from the kind of military action we see today, which is increasingly degenerating into ruthless killing.


Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman

cover: /assets/book-covers/good-omens.jpg

I picked this one up on Sr. B's recommendation and enjoyed it in multi-voice audiobook form. Overall, a fun listen. Very (in-)effable(?). Lots of jokes and satirical observations reminiscent of Doug Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and I think way more Pratchett than Gaiman.

I couldn't help but wonder which of the two authors identified and wrote more of the demon Crowley and the angel Aziraphale. Their hilarious love-hate dynamic reminded me of the starkly different and far more self-serious duo depicted in [[This is How You Lose the Time War]].

On that more serious note, Good Omens explores the possibility of Angels, Demons, and God having a free will. As the end of the world nears it becomes clear that the great conflict of this book is not between good and evil. Both sides act wrongly, and dream only of a war of total annihilation in which one of them wins and the other loses. A zero-sum game. In a real sense, the Biblical "good" is also evil.

Instead, the real struggle is between forces that want the world to end, and those that, despite all imperfections, would prefer it to continue. Framed this way, I am reminded a lot of Carse (see [[Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse]]). And when the world of course doesn't end, my stance against millenarianism is only strengthened (see [[Millenarianism is always wrong]]).

Little notes:

- Adam Young is well named
- "Piss artist" is a great expression
- I knew all the "ineffable" jokes seemed familiar, and I must have recalled Dirk Gently, to whom I leave the last word:

> Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable, let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.


Mystery Teachings by J. M. Greer
===
posted: Mar 4, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/mystery-teachings.jpg

Ecology, complexity, and other interdisciplinary fields can easily slip into woo. Initially I expected this book to suffer from this problem, but luckily there were no dizzying invocations of Deepak Chiopra™ style quantum physics. Instead, Greer presents a grounded worldview, rejecting spiritual stereotypes and "half truths that you create your own reality".

The bulk of Greer's book features seven laws, which may be better described as perspectives or lenses. The first three are foundational, the fourth is a bridge, and the last three are somewhat derived from the first. Many of these so-called laws overlap with one another. Law of Planes and Law of Evolution are highly interrelated. Why are there seven laws? For relatively unconvincing reasons resembling gematria. I found these "laws" unevenly resonant, with the Law of Cause and Effect quite uninspiring, but others much more evocative.

(The [[Seven Fundamental Laws of Spiritual Ecology]] are well documented, so rather than enumerating them I'll just focus on the ideas across the laws that I found compelling.)

**An alternative entry point to complex systems** Greer's first three laws can be cleanly mapped to the canon of complexity science. Wholeness is all about the world consisting of complex adaptive systems. Flow is about stocks and flows. Finally, balance is about balancing feedback loops.

**Everything flows at different rates**. Flow rates vary, often moving at a pace far slower or faster than humans are capable of perceiving:

> the boulder left by a glacier on one corner of the meadow during the last ice age fifteen thousand years ago is slowly being weathered away by rain, wind, and the slow action of lichens, and fifteen thousand years from now, it will be a fraction of its present size. Solid as it seems, the stone is also flowing.

Perhaps there is a general scaling law that the smaller, the faster, and the higher the frequency? (Also see [[Small animals perceive time more quickly]] and [[Smaller objects move faster]])

**Accumulation is poison** because it effectively stops the natural flow of things. My initial reaction to this was one of skepticism: some accumulations seem alright. Organisms need a store of energy to survive. Accumulation also afford freedom. Freedom to consider something other than just constant toil for the purpose of survival.

Greer seems less judgmental about accumulation in the human realm, especially when this is for the future of one’s own life. He explicitly rejects that material wealth is an evil thing and the only right path is one of abject poverty. Instead, in the spirit of seeking a middle way (see [[Middle way in Buddhism]]), Greer suggests something that resonates with me:

> If material wealth is flowing into your life, material wealth in some form should be flowing out of it at an equal rate.

**Goldilocks zones and balance**: The opposite of thirst is not too much water, it’s just enough water. By default, people seek extremes and this intuition is often wrong. This section evoked a lot of related ideas for me:

- [[Balancing loops are goal seeking]]
- [[Active stability is related to non-equilibrium systems]]
- [[Goldilocks principle]]
- [[Too much of a virtue becomes a vice]]
- [[Scale causes ossification]]
- [[Two Watersheds - too much institutionalization]]
- [[People favor addition over subtraction]]

**Principle of rebound**: Intriguingly, Greer writes about a practical application of his Law of Balance. Deliberately push a balanced system one way, and you will make it swing back the other way with redoubled force. Fast so that you enjoy food more during the next days. This is a sort of synthesized delayed gratification. Related to [[Manufactured suffering for resilience, antifragility and happiness]].

**Constraints are a source of power and elegance**: Like the flow of water through a thinning tube, as the tube thins, the flow will become more and more powerful.

> Power is born when a flow of energy encounters firm limits, and the more narrow the outlet left open by those limits, the greater the power will be.

This resonated with me, and reminded me of the benefit of constraints:

- [[Constraints can be good for innovation]]
- [[Judaism encourages robust debate within constraints]]
- [[Benefits of manufactured childhood rebellion]]

I found that reframing beauty as "elegance" is generative, and fits well with Greer's example of bird flight, in which nature "engineered" or "designed" an elegant system:

> To achieve the power of flight, sparrows and most other birds accept strict and inflexible limits that prevent them from engaging in many activities that other living things can do. These limits are anything but arbitrary; rather, they are the other side of the power of flight itself.

Every manifestation in the real world is limited. If you break through these limits, you don't thrive, you die.

> When a cell ignores the limits placed on it by the body as a whole system and instead grows in an unlimited way, doctors call that condition "cancer." Freed from all limits, the human body would not become something superhuman; it would simply turn into a puddle of red slush, powerless, ugly, and dead.

**Overlapping planes of mind and body**: Greer's notion of planes is very abstract: "Everything exists and functions on one of several planes of being." The most concrete and interesting planes are the mind and the body plane. These planes interact, but only in very specific ways.

**Ecosystem lifecycles**: One intriguing idea in this chapter and the next was about the lifecycle of ecosystems:

> Just as every creature begins with a single cell and passes through its life cycle, every ecosystem begins with bare, nonliving elements and passes through stages, called "sers." Those stages reach from the first or pioneer sere that forms on bare ground right up to the final relatively stable sere, which ecologists call "the climax community."

(Also see the excellent Wikipedia article on this topic. [Climax community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_community) and [Seral community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seral_community)).

> A seral community is an intermediate stage found in ecological succession in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community

**Placeholders in ecosystems**: I found powerful the idea that individuals in an ecosystem can be seen as placeholders. The organism may die, but its immediate life wasn't that important for the whole system. The individual was playing a role that many had played in the past, and many will play in the future.

> The meadow in which the mouse and the grass thrive, in other words, is simply one phase of a greater process of change that began long before either one was born, and that meadow will continue long after both have died.

Furthermore, this role can be played by a variety of creatures that evolve, but are still fundamentally of the same lineage.

> Ten million years ago, some other species of small rodent filled the same role in meadow ecologies in the same region that the field house fills today, and ten million years from now, todays field mouse will likely be replaced by another species of rodent or some other creature not too different.

**Magic is about the mind**: Greer has a very hard boiled, realist take on magic. It mainly operates on the “plane of the mind”, and affects other planes only insofar as they overlap to the mind one. He talks lucidly of real limits when it comes to what you can expect magic to be able to achieve.

**Societal lifecycles**: Greer compares societies to ecosystems and suggests that they too have lifecycle. But what are the seres, and what is the climax community for societies? Perhaps the notion of progress is less clear.

> Each human society arises out of the chaos left behind by some previous society and it takes shape in response to whatever challenge the old society couldn’t meet.

This reminds me of Turchin ([[Fathers-and-sons cycles]]) as well as Tainter ([[Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter]]). But there is less of a clear sense of progress from one society to the next. This rhymes with the nonlinearity of moral progress (see [[Moral progress is a cycle, technological progress is an arrow]]).

> It is unfortunately common for the people of one society to ignore the hard won wisdom of older societies and suffer as a result.

**Technological lifecycles?** Greer goes further. He wouldn’t be surprised if at the end of our industrial society in several decades, many of today’s tech will become the stuff of legend. Atlantis, an advanced but lost civilization is a common trope in mystery schools. All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.

> The people of Atlantis ignored the laws of spiritual ecology and by the time those laws finished with them, nothing remained of Atlantis but gray waves rolling across empty ocean.

**Dealing with higher ideals vs. disappointing realities**: paraphrasing Greer, there are a few options:

1. Settle for the world as it is, optimizing for pleasure and profit.
2. Turn to ordinary religion with the hope of a better world after death.
3. Join social movements or political activism to make the world a better place.
4. Convince yourselves that changing your own thinking will scale up.
5. Sit and wait for some apocalyptic event to make the world live up to our expectations.

> Yet there is also another way: the way of the mysteries. This way starts by realizing that our everyday life in the world of manifestation, here and now, exactly as it is, is a lesson to be studied and understood, rather than a trap to be escaped or an illusion to be ignored. It goes on to recognize that the same laws that shape our ecological relationships with the world around us also define our existence in the subtler realms of mind and spirit and that learning to live and act in harmony.

I like Greer's call to curiosity, but it seems to me that the mystery schools are just one of many different ways to study and understand the lessons from daily life. Still, I'm pleasantly surprised how neatly Greer's ideas map onto my existing canon of Complexity-related notes. Also, it's useful to find giant gaps in my understanding of ecology (e.g. sers, climax communities, etc) will surely make for an illuminating follow-up.


Technofeudalism by Yanis Varoufakis
===
posted: Mar 1, 2024
rating: no
cover: /assets/book-covers/technofeudalism.jpg

Varoufakis' book is written as a missive to his late socialist father, as an attempt to answer his question “Now that computers speak to each other, will capitalism self-destruct or become unassailable?”. His answer is confidently that capitalism has already metastasized into something much worse, characterized by a highly centralized Big Tech sector which engages in rent seeking behavior. He sensationally calls this diagnosis Technofeudalism, and his remedies are unconvincing.

**Manufacturing demand post-WW2**: Going beyond Zeihan (see [[The End of the World Is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan]]), Varoufakis elaborates on how the WW2-era war machine was turned into a consumer-facing economy. He describes the period between WW2 and now as one in which the US established global hegemony. This soviet-esque centrally planned war economy was a great success. During the war, America's manufacturing machine grew so large that once the war was over and it switched to consumer goods, it would overflow the US market. As a result, there was a need to manufacture more demand domestically, and to create international demand for American goods. Thus in addition to robust advertisement at home, we needed America's exported global culture. (Lots of overlap with Adam Curtis' Century of the Self, and a reference to [Mad Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-HR88uPBU))

**Sacking the commons**: Varoufakis claims that large paradigm shifts aren’t just technological but first social. For the internet age, he describes a politically sanctioned plunder of the internet commons. This was followed by the invention of page rank and other tech.

Provocative analogy of common protocols of internet 1.0 (IMAP, SMTP, HTTP) to the British forests. Both used to be public, but became increasingly privatized and exploited for its resources for personal and corporate gain.

**Incentivizing over-complication**: Bankers are incentivized to make complex instruments that are not well understood by the public. Big tech employees are similarly incentivized to do the same, creating complex systems to dazzle promotion committees with their sheer ambition and scalability and level of abstraction. [[Simplicity is underrated at Big Tech]]

**Rents vs. profits**: Varoufakis rails against rent seeking as something that is actively destructive in the tradition of Adam Smith. His argument is that when rental income dominates corporate profits, you end up with a sort of degenerative capitalism that he calls feudalism. But how is rent different than profit fundamentally?

- Profits is reduced by competition while rent is not. If my neighbor landlords raise rents, my rent also goes up.
- Branding extracts not just profits but “brand rents”, which let them accrue value for “nothing”
- (He doesn't mention this, but presumably we want to avoid monopolies too. In a monopoly you end up with only one winner taking the whole pie.)

**Capitalism ➡ Technofeudalism**: Varoufakis' main argument is that modern capitalism has changed over the last decades, and no longer resembles the capitalism of the early 20th century. In particular, he blames big tech's cloud computing sector for rent seeking behavior. He calls this shift "technofeudalism" but acknowledges that this is spin — a marketing term designed to evoke the gravity of the situation. He lists many examples of cloud rent:

- Apple and Play Store are lords, charging app developer as vassals a 30% tax.
- Major cloud providers (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) charging for cloud APIs that enable all applications.
- Amazon taking a fee for selling goods in their online marketplace.

Related: [[Building on a platform is providing free R&D]]

**The remedy**: Varoufakis notes that historically, the economic left struggles with offering a socialist vision for what the future ought to be, and attempts to remedy it by providing one. His vision is extremely multifaceted and includes many huge ideas, many of which he devotes fewer than a paragraph to. They include:

- Democratic corporations: divide post tax profits into tranches: fixed costs, salaries, bonuses.
- Mostly egalitarian: each employee owns exactly one share of their company.
- Bonuses: determined by Eurovision style tokens, similar to peer bonuses at Google.
- Everything will be run by the committees, at various levels. Very anarchist.
- Sortition: random delegates are chosen to represent some committees (see [[Sortition prevents power hungry people from exerting too much control]]).
- Land reform: land is constantly on auction. Varoufakis doesn't bother citing Henry George, but he is clearly taking a page from his book (see [[Georgism is a constantly running auction on all land]]).
- Workers of the world unite: a global alliance of consumers, unionized workers, etc should decide to strike against all Amazon warehouses at the same time.

Like many radicals, Varoufakis suffers from the pathology of being unable to even propose a coherent desired state, let alone a path to getting there (see [[Strategy != Goals != Ambitions]]). He describes a very elaborate, broad ranging vision, and then posits that the many modifications he proposes will get us there. I'm highly skeptical that this would work, since each one of the bullet points above are big ideas on their own and would introduce dozens of second order effects. In tandem, these second order effects would only multiply, leading to some unfathomable future even a very small number of time-steps away.

Perhaps Varoufakis is well grounded on many of these interventions. He worked at Valve previously, which I think is the source of some of the ideas behind "democratic corporations", but the book ends abruptly without much detail into these actual policies. But it feels to me that going into actual policy was never his goal. "Technofeudalism" is a manifesto that describes meaty problems without seriously proposing adequate solutions.

- Bessemer process first enable large scale steel production. This enabled a lot more things to be built out of steel, such as ship hulls, which up to the 1850s were necessarily built out of wood. More in [[Diffusion of steel technology]].
- Contra the author, Thomas Edison did not actually electrocute an elephant to spread it alternating current. That’s a common misconception and draft the narrative. [[List of my own misconceptions]]
- A compelling point that crypto is just another vehicle for Wall Street now. It’ll especially clear now that BTC is part of the various retirement funds. Just another vehicle for readying existing power structures.
- Two antagonistic "super cloud fiefs". Chinese and American. But I don’t think that the Chinese superfiefdom is open for business.
- After US froze Russia central bank out of the global financial system, Varoufakis claims that it’s the first time this happened. Even during the Russia-Britain war in 1850 (Crimean war?) British and Russian bankers continued to collaborate. True?


David: The Divided Heart by David Wolpe
===
posted: Feb 23, 2024
rating: yes
cover: /assets/book-covers/david-divided-heart.jpg

I read this book as respite from Samuel I and before tackling Samuel II. Wolpe's retelling of David's stories is lively, easy to read, and insightful. Most of this book summarizes David's story from various perspectives: as a young man, on the run from Saul, as a king, as a father, at the end of his journey, and as the progenitor of the Messiah. I found Wolpe's negative insights to be the most incisive.

Wolpe observes that

> Conventional religion has a regrettable tendency to do surgery on the human soul, leaving only the exalted parts.

Not so with David. In the words of Baruch Halpern, "David is the first human being in world literature". Wolpe's overall portrait of David is not super sympathetic. David's flaws, sins, and moral failings are so great that this sentiment from former Israeli president Shimon Peres seems like an understatement:

> Not everything David did on land, or on roofs, appears to me to be Judaism.

The author of this book is my radar from a number of different directions, most surprisingly via his [interview with Sadhguru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQzPhEbyZ5g).

**The supernatural and the feminine**: With the exception of Saul raising Samuel from the dead, there is not a single supernatural miracle in the entire story of David. Wolpe observes that when David needs a miracle, God finds a woman to enact it in an earthly manner. Is this like [real life](https://youtu.be/txqiwrbYGrs?si=9PPAGRrQ5006kbis&t=15)?

**Family strife**: Wolpe writes resonantly that “for king or commoner, the pain in families dwarfs even the final, eschatological battle”. David's family is rather extreme, a wild caricature of the sorts of pedestrian problems most people experience in their life. In a modern reading, does one soften and interpret them as allegory?

- David commits both adultery and murder in one sordid chapter, sleeping with Bathsheva ("I saw her bathing on the roof") and sending her husband Uriah to die at the hands of the Ammonites.
- Nathan's prophecy that David and Bathsheba's first child would die then comes true.
- David's children reenact David's own rape-and-murder when Amnon rapes his half-sister Tamar. Tamar's brother Absalom then avenges this act by murdering Amnon. All three are David's children.
- Absalom attempts to usurp the throne from David in his moment of weakness. David flees like he fled from his stepfather Saul. Eventually David tries to spare Absalom, but his general kills his son against his will.
- David's parting words to his son and heir Solomon are ruthless: kill Joab (David's general), kill Shimei (a man from Saul's lineage), and dispatch of Adonijah (David's son). Solomon systematically executes his father's wishes and secures his succession.

I must say, recalling David's story in detail really enhances my appreciation the much loved "Hallelujah":

> But all I ever learned from love,
> Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.

Wolpe argues that David is the cho­sen of God exact­ly because of his com­plex­i­ty, which strikes me as a very modern take. Would the authors of the Bible considered complexity a desirable quality? I suspect they would laud David for being a great warrior king. A gentler modern reading is far more damning. David was "a man after God’s own heart", at the cost of sordid and tragic personal and family affairs. A broken hallelujah.


Every Life is on Fire by Jeremy England

I came across this peculiar book in a circuitous way. I listened to part of an interview in which a certain Beff Jesos spent an inordinate amount of time speculating about non-equilibrium systems and how they might relate to the genesis of life. He also casually name-dropped Jeremy England. On his lead, I read an article about some of recent research on life-like simulations that seem to spontaneously reach orderly states, and came across this book. Turns out England is not just a statistical physicist, but also an ordained rabbi, and that "Every Life is On Fire" is a strange amalgam of condensed matter theory and The Torah, which sounded right up my alley.

Overall, I found the book thought-provoking and worthwhile despite its unevenness, abrupt end, and overreliance on scripture. One obscure episode from Exodus in which God teaches Moses to turn his hand sickly white and revert it back to normal was given far too much weight, resulting in a contorted and unconvincing analogy. On the other hand, some Torah references illuminated the author's thought process, and at a meta-level, reminded me about the flexibility of human minds to synthesize across such seemingly disparate fields. Anyway here are some ideas that stood out to me:

**Escape velocity and state changes**: An intuitive and new-to-me way of looking at changes in state. Consider a particle in its transition from liquid to gas (e.g. boiling water), we can apply the concept of escape velocity. This particle is like a rocket trying to escape the gravitational field of earth. In this analogy, the earth is made out of these rocket-particles, so as more of them leave, the earth's mass decreases, effectively reducing escape velocity. This bandwagon effect applies generally to state changes, explaining why we observe quick transitions rather than gradual ones.

**Limitations of "first principles thinking"**: Reductionism holds that you can understand system by just understanding its constituent parts. But a complex system is often greater than the sum of its parts, exhibiting emergent behavior, so reductive thinking is inherently limited. Emergence is the opposite of reductionism. Multiple different fields have evolved to study phenomena from different perspectives. Each field has their scope and level of abstraction, suited to best study the phenomenons in their scope.

**Life and life-likeness**: Physics doesn't concern itself with defining life, but some life-like properties can be described in physical terms. For example, life tends to replicate itself, tends to require external energy and use it to repair itself. Considering some edge cases reveals how complex the barrier between life and not-life is:

 - Fire can self-replicate by spreading through a dry forest
 - Ice can repair itself if you make a hole in it and wait for the water to freeze

**Active and passive stability**: Consider the self repair of an ice sheet crushed by a stick and the self repair that happens when skin repairs a cut. These are very different processes; skin is capable of dynamic self-repair, but ice is passively self-repaired.

Life has a tendency to exist in states that require constant energy input just to remain alive; repair happens continuously in response to ongoing wear and tear. In the event of a cut, the same regular maintenance occurs but perhaps at an accelerated rate.

A frozen pond, in contrast, requires no continuous energy to remain frozen. The crystal structure of the ice is sufficiently stable that it can just continue to exist as long as the temperature doesn't increase. If the structure is disrupted, water under the ice will naturally return to the surface and spontaneously freeze because of the temperature of the surroundings, self-repairing spontaneously.

The downside of the frozen pond strategy is that ice's crystal structure is highly vulnerable to changes in the environment. When it gets warm, the crystal will reliably melt and turn into water. This is static stability.

A biological system, in contrast, typically has a broader operating range, and is more resilient to environmental variation. Life is complex and constantly requires external energy to survive, but it is far more resilient.

**Everything interesting flows**: is it true that all interesting systems require a constant flow of inbound energy? Equilibrium is death. There is a cascade of systems in which energy flows from one system to the next, with each of the energy flows cyclical in nature. These sub-systems are not in equilibrium, but they are still in predictable flow states. (There's an amazing visualization to be made on this theme, along the lines of [Powers of Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0))

**Resonance and adaptation**: Energy does not just come into a system in some random way. Instead, its flow and properties have a certain structure. For example, a singer can break a glass with her voice if her pitch matches the resonance frequency of the glass. The singer's voice can be represented as a spectrum of frequencies and powers. In this case, the singer modulates the frequency of the sound wave she emits until it matches that of the glass, and then cranks up the amplitude.

The singer's pitch is the source of energy for the singer-glass system. Unlike the singer-glass, most systems have a fixed source of energy, and entities in the system can adapt to it. In the singer-glass system, imagine an imaginary glass that changes size to match the resonance frequency of the singer's voice. Like the singer's voice, the sun's rays transmit electromagnetic energy in a particular spectrum of frequencies and powers. And like the glass, every living creature adapts to this structured energy to survive.

**Energy in the Goldilocks zone**: If energy is not structured correctly or is overpowering, it can be destructive to a system. England makes an interesting Goldilocks zone argument (see [[Goldilocks principle]]) inspired by the paradoxical story of Moses and the burning bush.

- A bush subject to no external driving force will die of neglect.
- A bush subject to too chaotic an external driving force will die of immolation.
- A bush needs to have structured external driving forces to thrive.

This is what inspired the name of the book. Every life is a bit on fire.


End of the World by Peter Zeihan

Zeihan's book is an interesting exercise in scenario planning: what if America decides to step back from its role as policeman of the world? But this is not the framing that the author uses. Instead, the book is a high-confidence prediction about the future based on geopolitical and demographic trends. In short, America will step down as global hegemon, global trade will end, supply chains will be irreparably damaged, the world will turn multipolar, and everyone will starve to death, except the Americans who will be a-OK!

Zeihan is a consultant to large companies making important strategic decisions, so I guess high confidence comes with the territory. I would be surprised if Zeihan's world transpires fully, but he makes good "big history" points and the book was worthwhile if you can get past the bombastic vibes.

In general, Zeihan does a good job of going pretty deep into how the world works, and explaining things like I'm five. This is inevitably simplifying, as in his explanation of mediums of exchange, which ignore ledgers as an important part of the history (see [Debt by David Graeber](books/debt-the-first-5000-years/)). Nits aside, I really liked his concise chronicle of global mediums of exchange, all historically gold-backed currencies, all the way to the end of Bretton Woods, where the USD now floats freely, untethered to gold. There is a certain unevenness in the presentation however, for example I really disliked his convoluted explanation of inflation, disinflation, and deflation.

The book delves surprisingly deeply into many nitty-gritty side-spurs most of which I think serve to explain the complexity of the modern manufacturing.

**Geographies of Success**. At different stages of human civilization, different geographic features were desirable. For example:

- Hunter-gatherers geography of success: access to a variety of climactic zones, often best situated at the bases of mountains.
- Farmer geography of success: access to water, but also insulated from other people by large deserts.

Selon Zeihan, during the globalized American Order, these geographies ceased to matter, since you could get anything shipped to you. But once The Order collapses, they will begin to matter again.

**The Order and globalization**: After World War II, America was in a position to try to establish a Rome-like global empire. America weighed her options and decided that direct rule would be unsustainable. Instead, America wisely bought a period of peace by offering a militarily brokered economic order with prosperity for all. This meant an essentially global free trade network without any of the historical challenges and high costs. Previous trade networks had way more middle-men charging exuberant prices at every step of the way and way smaller shipping volumes. This ushered in an unprecedented peace dividend (see [[The peace dividend is over]]).

**Collapse of The Order**: When the Soviets emerged as a countervailing pole shortly after WW2, America's need to create a strong western alliance became even stronger. When the Soviet empire collapsed, and America "won" the Cold War, it lost its sense of urgency and direction. Zeihan claims that the order is over without much justification. It seems to be more of a mood affiliation (see [[The fallacy of mood affiliation]])

**The uneven spread of tech revolutions**: the industrial revolution began in Britain, where it took decades to refine the key inventions: steam engines, looms, factories. Subsequent adoption in other countries like Germany proceeded much faster. Later entrants like China industrialized even faster.

**Demographic determinism**: It's hard to refute demographics, which are definitely an underrated (by me) source of long-term future projection. Given a demographic pyramid of the current world, it's relatively easy to predict a future pyramid because of population dynamics. In general, the more affluent a country, the lower the birth rate. If you have few children today, you will likely have few children in twenty years, because fewer children today means fewer child-bearing adults.

One major flaw with demographic determinism is that there is more to the story than just age. For example, a large young population may be skilled or unskilled, and these scenarios will play out very differently.

Straightforward projection of demographics does not account for immigration. Countries like the US and Canada are based on an influx of people from the outside, and this remains a major advantage compared to many other countries, which have similarly low birth rates but no immigration.

**De-sourcing trend**: Multinational companies set up factories in other countries, hiring the local population and selling them the goods. Japan does this globally with Toyota and other car companies. China does this with their auto industry in Russia, especially after the pandemic (see [[Russian car industry after War on Ukraine]]). The US does this all over the world.

**The Order is fragile**. Zeihan points to a historical episode in the 1980s, where the Iraq-Iran war disrupted global trade because the insurance industry collapsed. This rhymes a lot with what's happening in the Red Sea and Yemen's Houthi trade route disruptions. Large container ships enable essentially free global shipping and a very complex supply chain for all things. Unfortunately they cannot be easily defended, and having military escorts for all of them would be very expensive. Zeihan calls them "floating buffets" for other countries to raid.

**Without The Order**: Zeihan's predictions without American-backed global free trade are dire.

- Unlike the Eurozone, Southeast Asia does not have an independently curated peace treaty, and many countries still harbor great hatreds towards one another from past aggression and atrocities (eg. most hate Japan, many fear China).
- Purely oil exporting countries which dominate the Middle East rely on everyone else for everything else.
- These Persian Gulf countries also rely on external experts for building and maintaining their own oil infrastructure, including both extraction and transportation.
- (Israel is half a world away, so if the American brokered global peace ends, it will be Israel against its genocidal Arab neighbors which outnumber it by orders of magnitude.)

**Split by hemisphere?** Zeihan predicts a multipolar world that is for some reason split by hemispheres. The American hemisphere will do super well for many reasons. First, there is so much untapped resource potential in America. Mexico has the right demographics and US has the right expertise to replace a lot of global supply chains. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will suffer because of longstanding hatreds, relative lack of resources.

Pointers:

- Dominant professions over time: this would be an interesting statistic to track. One angle could be to investigate the capital investment going into each profession. Another could be just raw numbers. [[Most common professions over history]]
- Japanese finance culture and debt forgiveness: Zeihan mentions some Japan-specific historical precedent having to do with debt forgiveness.
- Demographic pyramids in general seem really powerful and interesting tools. <https://www.visualcapitalist.com/population-pyramids-compared>
- 3D printing could be a significant enabling technology if Zeihan's dire predictions come to pass and globalized world trade propped up by the American Order vanishes.
- In a zero-sum world, people will be more likely to look for scapegoats even in America and we all know what that means...
