      <p>When my sailing class was canceled back in early March, I realized it was time for a more individualistic hobby. And so, I furled the sails and tied up the boat and picked up a circular saw from the hardware store. After I got over my fears of loud, terrifyingly quickly spinning metal blades, a whole bunch of cutting and screwing, then digging and painting, I have a Little Free Library standing outside my house, and a little bit more confidence for the next woodworking project!</p>

<p>I drafted some <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d57c2f5444558be437e513c4/w/9e862248a8541fe7ce7a38a6/e/3efc51d554390f104d869fa6">initial plans in OnShape</a>, and deviated from them only slightly, the main difference being a much smaller front-right panel to make book access easier. As I became familiar with woodworking tools, I became a little bit less rigid and precise with measurements. </p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<ul>
<li>A very long plank of scrap wood found in my basement, 20mm deep was enough for structural materials.</li>
<li>30 or so brass screws</li>
<li>6 long screws</li>
<li>A fence post</li>
<li>Self-closing hinges and a button</li>
<li>Exterior-grade paint</li>
<li>A sheet of thin scrap plywood for shingles</li>
<li>Plexiglass sheet</li>
<li>Circular saw</li>
<li>Electric drill</li>
<li>Silicone mat</li>
<li>Caulk</li>
<li>Hammer</li>
<li>Shovel</li>
<li>Wood hand saw</li>
<li>Probably lots more</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mistakes and learnings:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don’t use brass screws, they are fragile. I broke two of them as I was screwing them. Instead, use steel. It’s cheaper and far stronger.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on glue for shingles. They warp, so use nails to hammer them on. I had to do this after it rained and they warped, despite a copious amount of glue.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on the guide of the circular saw. Instead, look at what the blade is actually doing at the cut point. I had a few rough cuts early on.</li>
<li>Use a protractor in order to measure 45 degree angles more accurately, which I found tricky to do through thick 4x4 fence posts (circular saw radius was too small, had to use a hand saw)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K3xP2XjPmUQ2bX1N7">more photos</a> that document the process. The results are passable but honestly, a little bit sloppy. Build quality aside, I’m thrilled to see actual use: the roster of books changing quickly. My initial dump of philosophy books was partially picked off, and then swiftly amended. I had predicted very little movement during the pandemic because of decreased foot traffic and increased paranoia about touching public things, but was sorely mistaken.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matthew for the pro-tips and help!</p>
