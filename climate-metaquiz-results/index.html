      <p><a href="/viewpoint-tolerance-through-curiosity/">Last week</a> I ran a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf98rBi2CgU4b62kBFmAeX989ZGZrLW74cQitDdPT7wG906Xw/viewform">Climate metaquiz</a>, and 123 people responded.
The point of a metaquiz is to test how well political groups know the other
side, while questions on personal beliefs and knowledge about the climate are
secondary. Both the small sample size and potential sampling biases are
important caveats to keep in mind here. All that said, Republicans outperformed
Democrats on the factual part of the quiz, despite their low self-reported
self-confidence.  However, Democrats outperformed Republicans on the <em>metaquiz</em>
part, with Republicans tending to exaggerate levels of climate change-related
handwringing amongst Democrats, as well as their eagerness to exaggerate the
facts in the name of behavior change.</p>

<p>Sanity checking, the self-reported data matches stereotypes. 60% of Republican
test takers believe climate change is less serious than the scientific
consensus, compared to 6% of Democrats. Democrat test takers were far more
concerned (2.8 on a 5-point likert scale) about climate change affecting them
personally and future generations than Republicans (1.8). Republicans were very
skeptical about water level increases by 2100, predicting an average of less
than 2 feet rise, while democrats were more concerned, predicting on average
more than 3 feet.</p>
<h1>Actual vs. predicted results</h1>
<p>Since this was a metaquiz, the focus was not on the participants' own beliefs
and knowledge of the climate, but their predictions about the other side. The
reason for the first sections was only to establish a baseline. Here are the
aggregated results. I calculate percentage error using this simple formula: <code>%
error = (actual - predicted) / actual</code>:</p>

<h2>Interesting findings</h2>
<p>In aggregate, participants underestimated how well the other side did on the
quiz (total 10 points). Republicans predicted 4.84 (actual 5.9) for Democrats,
while Democrats predicted 4.95 (actual 6.39) for Republicans. About 20% of all
respondents thought they did better than the other side, as many thought
that they did worse, while the rest weren't sure. One exception here are
Republicans, who exhibited false modesty: 40% of them thought that the Democrats
would perform better.</p>
<p><strong>Exaggerating facts</strong>: Republicans thought Democrats would be much more
comfortable exaggerating scientific facts to convince others of environmentally
beneficial behavior change (predicted 2.9) more so than Democrats declared
(reported 1.6). On the flip side, democrats didn't think the Republicans would
be comfortable exaggerating scientific facts for the environment (predicted
1.4), and they were right (reported: 1.2). It was pointed out to me that the way
I phrased the question was quite leading: "It's okay to exaggerate scientific
facts in order to convince others to behave in a more environmentally friendly
way." but I'm not sure which way this would bias quiz and meta-quiz takers.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of climate change</strong>: Democrats accurately predicted Republican
lack of concern about climate change affecting them personally (reported: 1.8,
predicted: 1.7) and future generations (reported: 2.7, predicted: 2.3).
Republicans predicted Democrats would be slightly more concerned about the
climate than they were both personally (reported: 2.8, predicted: 3.5) and for
future generations (reported: 4.2, predicted: 4.5). The same trend was repeated
when asked about water level rise by 2100. Democrats correctly predicted that
Republicans would be conservative about future water level rises (reported: 1.8
ft, predicted: 1.8 ft), while Republicans were way off about what Democrats
would think (reported: 3.1 ft, predicted: 4.7 ft). This asymetry is intriguing.</p>
<p>I must again caveat all of this with the fact that 123 quiz takers does not
constitute a statistically significant sample, not to mention selection biases
that come from posting the quiz on twitter and some rationalist forums. Still,
it's interesting to see the consistency with which Republicans tended to
exaggerate Democratic positions more than vice-versa. One explanation is that
Paul Krugman was right <a href="http://cafehayek.com/2011/06/open-letter-to-paul-krugman-2.html">when he said</a> "A liberal can talk coherently
about what the conservative view is because people like me actually do listen."
Another explanation is that this disparity is due to the unique dynamics of
climate change, which is a much more important issue for Democrats than for
Republicans. It would be interesting to do more metaquizzes on other topics that
are more balanced in perceived importantness. Perhaps the metaquiz could be
framed as a "competition in understanding" between the two sides.</p>
<p>I find the metaquiz format to be an interesting one, serving a purpose similar
to the <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html">Ideological Turing Test</a>, but requiring less effort of everyone
involved (ie. essay reading or writing). Thanks again to the survey takers.  If
you left your email and are curious about how well you did on the metaquiz part,
let me know and I'll send you your personal results.</p>
<p>As always, please send me feedback on the metaquiz concept via twitter or email.</p>
