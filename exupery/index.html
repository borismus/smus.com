      <p>Exupery was a voice-powered sketching robot. I named it after Antoine de Saint-Exupéry because of the conversation in his most famous book where the Little Prince asks the pilot to draw him a picture of a sheep. You, too, can now ask Exupery to sketch pictures of things, and it will try to oblige. It replicates sketches drawn by real people playing the game <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/">Quick, Draw!</a>, and adding a bit of flourish. Try the <a href="https://borismus.github.io/exupery">online demo</a>, and read on to find out more.</p>

<p>The hardware version of Exupery was built as a showpiece for the <a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/">AIY Projects Voice Kit</a> and presented at Maker Faire back in 2017 (see <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMUYERaAJ6SFUsLDrN1mRSIQ21Ci0AyblkR779ggGk2Z-7-3PM6VmuLeiljQWyXXw/photo/AF1QipOMRFAQyY0T5pmExxFRY_Sm7RxLLI_PyMBKALeG?key=dnIwaWpOSkswMEFJdEdJLVZxSEZQNkNGelhRUmd3">photos</a>). To show it off at Maker Faire, we used an <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/846">AxiDraw V3</a>, a maker-friendly and surprisingly precise pen plotter. Here's an example of a sketch being produced using the hardware. Be sure to unmute this video to hear the linear actuator servomotor's song!</p>

<p><video src="/exupery/exupery-bot.mp4" controls loop></video></p>

<p>Today, given the slim chance that you have such a device, Exupery can also just <a href="https://borismus.github.io/exupery">run on the web</a>, with a virtual pen drawing on a virtual canvas. To get Exupery sketching, say something like "draw me a sheep". If you aren't satisfied with your sheep, try "do it again". Once you're ready to move on, ask it to "draw something else" for a random sketch.</p>

<p>Exupery has a few fun features going above and beyond the call of duty. Great artists sign their work, so Exupery labels the thing it sketches after drawing it. Implementing this was a fun excuse to dig into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts">vector fonts</a>. If you don't keep it occupied with a query quickly enough, Exupery gets bored and starts drawing little doodles all over the canvas. The entire user interface for Exupery is sketched using icons from <em>Quick, Draw!</em>. This includes the virtual pencil it uses to draw, as well as the microphone indicating that it's time to speak.</p>

<p>Exupery was a fun project hearkening back to a simpler time. Today I'm pleased to revive it and release it into the world. So try it out <a href="https://borismus.github.io/exupery">live</a>, grab the code on github and as always, I'd love to hear your thoughts. À bientôt!</p>
