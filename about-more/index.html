      <p>While on the Google VR team, I created, evangelized and maintained fundamental
WebVR <a href="https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill">tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">libraries</a>. I was fortunate to be on
the founding team of <a href="http://g.co/cardboard">Google Cardboard</a>, where I invented the
<a href="http://smus.com/magnetic-input-mobile-vr/">original input method</a>.</p>

<p>At Google Research, I created <a href="http://g.co/tone">Google Tone</a>, which reduced the barrier to
sharing locally by sending URLs over audio, as well as many other exciting
prototypes. I also provided technical direction to small teams of software
engineers, and received over twenty patents in the process.</p>

<p>I joined Google as an engineer on the Chrome developer relations team. I helped
launch <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&amp;hl=en">Chrome for Android</a>, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">wrote dozens of articles</a>, <a href="/talks">gave
talks to thousands of developers</a> and released widely used open source
libraries and samples.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about the intersection of web, music, and education. I began by
<a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">writing</a> <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/games/">tutorials</a> on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio API</a>, which eventually
turned into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Audio-API-Boris-Smus/dp/1449332684">short O'Reilly book</a> on the subject, complete with
<a href="http://webaudioapi.com/samples/">usage samples</a>. I continue to use the API to build browser based
audio applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://borismus.github.io/spectrogram/">spectrogram</a> which later became part of the <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Spectrogram">Chrome Music
Lab</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/filter-playground/">Filter Playground</a>, which I built to better understand digital filters.</li>
<li>Browser-based <a href="/web-voice-command-recognition/">audio</a> and <a href="/web-audio-ml-features/">machine learning tools</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to Google, I worked at Apple for two years, contributing to iWeb, iWork
and helping start <a href="https://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/">iWork.com</a>.</p>

<p>I hold a masters in HCI from <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I focused
on social and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bIgFmUwAAAAJ">wearable computing research</a> and built
<a href="http://crowdforge.com/">CrowdForge</a>, a system for crowdsourcing complex tasks. </p>

<p>I am Canadian. I received a BSc (w/ honours) in Mathematics and Computer Science
from the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>. </p>

Canada. </p>
