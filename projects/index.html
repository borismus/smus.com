      <h2>Web Audio</h2>
      <h3>Open-source development and writing</h3>
      <p class="date">2011 — now</p>
      <p>
        I could write an ode to the web platform and to the power of the web
        Audio API. When I worked with Chrome Developer Relations, I had the
        opportunity to write a number of articles on the Web Audio API, which
        came together in an O'Reilly Book. Since then, I have been an avid user
        of the API, which came together in a number of open source projects.

      <h3>Crowdsourcing and visualization projects</h3>
      <p class="date">2011 — now</p>
      <p>
      My Crowdforge research at CMU showed that Microtask markets like MTurk can be used to accomplish complex tasks. I then got a taste for the wisdom of the crowds, as well as their foolishness. Could random people on the internet be corralled to create a tech tree? Could they be asked to tinker with an evolutionary origami art system? Could people with opposing viewpoints be brought together to participate in friendlier debates?
