I built and maintained libraries like the  WebVR Polyfill  to provide head tracking and lens distortion in vanilla JavaScript.  WebVR Boilerplate  helped me build numerous creative VR experiences to inspire and help novices get started with VR on the web.

I specialized in mobile web development, writing articles with millions of views featured on  https://html5rocks.com . My secondary focus was on browser audio, including writing an O'Reilly book about the Web Audio API. Since then, I have been an avid user of the API, which came together in a number of open source projects.

Social Computing       Crowdsourcing and visualization projects       2010 - now               My Crowdforge research at CMU showed that Microtask markets like Mechanical Turk can be used to accomplish complex tasks. I then got a taste for the wisdom of the crowds, as well as their foolishness. Could random people on the internet be corralled to create a tech tree? Could they be asked to tinker with an evolutionary origami art system? Can people with opposing viewpoints be brought together to participate in friendlier debates?

Physical Computing       Reality is underrated       2009 - now               I like building things with my hands. It's a nice remedy to staring at screens all day long.

I built and maintained libraries like the  WebVR Polyfill  to provide head tracking and lens distortion in vanilla JavaScript.  WebVR Boilerplate  helped me build numerous creative VR experiences to inspire and help novices get started with VR on the web.

The signal triggers a Chrome notification. Clicking it opens the transmitted URL in a new browser tab.

I specialized in mobile web development, writing articles with millions of views featured on  https://html5rocks.com . My secondary focus was on browser audio, including writing an O'Reilly book about the Web Audio API. Since then, I have been an avid user of the API, which came together in a number of open source projects.

Social Computing       Crowdsourcing and visualization projects       2010 - now               My Crowdforge research at CMU showed that Microtask markets like Mechanical Turk can be used to accomplish complex tasks. I then got a taste for the wisdom of the crowds, as well as their foolishness. Could random people on the internet be corralled to create a tech tree? Could they be asked to tinker with an evolutionary origami art system? Can people with opposing viewpoints be brought together to participate in friendlier debates?

    <h2>WebXR (née WebVR)</h2>
    <h3>Open-source design and development</h3>
    <p class="date">2015 — 2017</p>
    <p>
      <p>When the web's VR ecosystem was still nascent, I helped to bootstrap it and make the WebVR API available even on low end devices like Google Cardboard. I built and maintained libraries like the <a href="https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill/">WebVR Polyfill</a> to provide head tracking and lens distortion in vanilla JavaScript. <a href="https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate">WebVR Boilerplate</a> helped me build numerous creative VR experiences to inspire and help novices get started with VR on the web.</p>

    <p class="date">2010 - now</p>
    <p>
      <p>My Crowdforge research at CMU showed that Microtask markets like Mechanical Turk can be used to accomplish complex tasks. I then got a taste for the wisdom of the crowds, as well as their foolishness. Could random people on the internet be corralled to create a tech tree? Could they be asked to tinker with an evolutionary origami art system? Can people with opposing viewpoints be brought together to participate in friendlier debates?</p>
