      <p>Work marketplaces like MTurk are great for accomplishing small, well
defined nuggets of work, such as labeling images and transcribing audio,
but terrible for many more complex and labor intensive real world tasks.
Over the last year, Robert Kraut, Niki Kittur and I formalized a general
process of solving such complex problems using MTurk. We proposed three
basic types of tasks and explored them in two neat experimental
applications. To facilitate these experiments, I implemented CrowdForge,
a Django framework that takes output from MTurk HITs and uses it to
create new MTurk HITs. </p>

<p>Solving complex problems on MTurk has always involved partitioning the
complex task into simpler sub-tasks.  CastingWords, one of the most
popular MTurk requesters, transcribes long audio recordings by splitting
them into overlapping segments, distributing the work among workers,
performing quality control and then recombining the transcription
fragments. CrowdForge formalizes this approach and takes it to the next
level. CrowdForge proposes the following task breakdown, roughly
inspired by the MapReduce programming paradigm:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>partition</strong> tasks split a problem into sub-problems (one to many)</li>
<li><strong>map</strong> tasks solve a small unit of work (one to one)</li>
<li><strong>reduce</strong> tasks combine multiple results into one (many to one)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/crowdforge/crowdforge-simple.png" alt="image" /> </p>

<p>CastingWords uses human intelligence only for their map tasks, which
consist of transcribing speech samples to text. Their partition task may
involve an algorithm which seeks natural breaks in speech audio samples,
while the reduce task may involve programmatic stitching of audio
samples. For sufficiently complex cases, however, algorithms may be
inadequate, and the partitioning and reduction require human
intelligence. Here are some experiments that illustrate this idea:</p>

<h2>Writing Articles</h2>

<p>In the first experiment, turkers generated encyclopedia-style articles
on a given subject. The approach I took was to first generate an article
outline using an partition task, then for each heading in the outline,
to collect facts on the topic, next to combine these facts into a
paragraph, finally merging all of the paragraphs into a final article.
The following diagram illustrates this process for an article on New
York City: </p>

<p><img src="/crowdforge/crowdforge-article.png" alt="image" /> </p>

<p>In one incarnation of this experiment, we used this approach to create
five articles about New York City. Articles cost an average of $3.26 to
produce, required an average of 36 subtasks or HITs, included an average
of 5.3 topics per article and consisted of an average of 658 words. As a
comparison baseline, we created eight HITs which each requested one
worker to write the full article, paying $3.26, the same amount required
for the collaboratively written articles. </p>

<p>We then evaluated the quality of all articles by asking a new set of
workers to each rate a single article based on use of facts, spelling
and grammar, article structure, and personal preference. On average the
articles produced by the group were of rated on par with the Simple
Wikipedia article on the same topic, and higher than those produced
individually. See the paper for gritty details on the stats.</p>

<h2>Product Comparisons</h2>

<p>We did another experiment to prove the generality of the approach. We
used CrowdForge to create purchase decision matrices to assist consumers
looking to buy a new car. Given a short description of a consumer need,
we created two partition tasks: one to decide which cars might be
appropriate to consider, and one to decide which features the consumer
cares most about. This double partition resulted in an empty product
comparison chart. Each cell in the chart then spawned a map task to
collect related facts. Next, these facts are reduced into a sentence,
resulting in a product comparison chart. Here's an excerpt: </p>

<p><img src="/crowdforge/crowdforge-purchase.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The entire task was completed in 54 different HITs for a total cost of
$3.70. When we tried to compare to the individual case, we had no
success getting individuals to generate a similar product comparison
chart, even when offering more money than we paid the entire group.</p>

<h2>Sweet Applications</h2>

<p>MTurk is a one of my favorite tools for doing <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-creative-uses-of-Amazon-s-Mechanical-Turk">creative and novel</a>
projects. As illustrated, applying human intelligence to reduce and
partition tasks, we can solve a new set of interesting problems. But
there is much more to explore! For example, imagine collaborative
drawing assignments in which a worker sketches out a picture, and
subsequent workers refine the original picture by drawing sub-pictures
or specific objects. Imagine requesting a trip plan and getting a
researched day-by-day itinerary of what to see and do. Imagine
partitioning a Java class into methods, outsourcing the implementation
and unit test implementations. </p>

<p>CrowdForge is written as a Django application that communicates with
MTurk servers using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/">Boto interface</a>, which is a Python framework
that encapsulates the Amazon Web Services API. CrowdForge regularly
polls MTurk and fires notifications whenever interesting things happen
(a new result comes in for a HIT, all HITs of a certain type are
finished, a HIT is expired or complete). CrowdForge can manage many
flows, which encapsulate code that determines how to respond to these
events. For example, the article writing flow knows to create fact
collection HITs for each outline topic once the outline is submitted. So
to solve a new kind of complex problem, you would extend CrowdForge with
a custom flow, like the following: </p>

<p>"But Boris", you say, "how can I get my hands on this CrowdForge
framework of yours?" Indeed, we just <a href="https://github.com/borismus/CrowdForge">released it</a> for non-commercial
use under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">the Creative Commons license</a>. Let me know if you have any
questions, comments or interest in collaborating or maintaining the framework.</p>
